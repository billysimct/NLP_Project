Overall, the report shows that higher prices have negatively affected most households and overall financial well-being declined over the prior year, though workers continued to benefit from a strong labor market.The report draws from the Board's tenth annual Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking, or SHED, which was conducted in October of last year. The report discusses findings related to financial well-being, income, expenses, employment, banking and credit, housing, retirement and investments, and higher education and student loans. The report, fact sheet, downloadable data, data visualizations, and a video summarizing the survey's findings are found here.The report indicates that self-reported financial well-being declined in 2022, in part reflecting ongoing concerns about higher prices. In the fourth quarter of 2022, 73 percent of adults reported either doing okay or living comfortably financially, down 5 percentage points from the previous year and among the lowest levels observed since 2016.Consistent with these changes in overall financial well-being, fewer adults reported having money left over after paying their expenses. Fifty-four percent of adults said that their budgets had been affected ""a lot"" by price increases. Parents living with children under age 18, Black adults, Hispanic adults, and those with a disability were more likely to say that their budgets had been affected ""a lot"" by higher prices.""The SHED results provide helpful insights into the economic well-being of Americans,"" said Federal Reserve Board Governor Michelle W. Bowman. ""It is important that we continue to refine our understanding of the economic challenges facing U.S. households.""The report also provides details on how people adjusted their financial behaviors in response to higher prices. Common strategies were using less of a product or stopping using it altogether, switching to a cheaper product; or delaying a major purchase. Fifty-one percent of adults reported that they reduced their savings in response to higher prices.Indicators of workers' opportunities for new positions and pay increases strengthened relative to 2021. The share who received a raise, asked for a raise, or voluntarily left a job increased over the prior year, while the share who lost a job decreased. For example, thirty-three percent of adults said they received a raise or promotion in the prior year, up 3 percentage points from 2021.Additionally, the share of adults who reported that they would cover a $400 emergency expense using cash or its equivalent was 63 percent. This was down 5 percentage points from a high in 2021. Thirteen percent of adults said they would be unable to pay the expense by any method, which was slightly higher than in the last survey.The survey included more than 11,000 adult respondents.For media inquiries, please email [email protected] or call (202) 452-2955.Economic Well-Being of U.S. Households in 2022 (PDF)Economic Well-Being of U.S. Households in 2022 Fact Sheet (PDF)"

6,5/3/2023,"Economic activity expanded at a modest pace in the first quarter. Job gains have been robust in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low. Inflation remains elevated.The U.S. banking system is sound and resilient. Tighter credit conditions for households and businesses are likely to weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation. The extent of these effects remains uncertain. The Committee remains highly attentive to inflation risks.The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. In support of these goals, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 5 to 5-1/4 percent. The Committee will closely monitor incoming information and assess the implications for monetary policy. In determining the extent to which additional policy firming may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time, the Committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments. In addition, the Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities, as described in its previously announced plans. The Committee is strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent objective.In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.Voting for the monetary policy action were Jerome H.

Powell said.

10,4/21/2023,"The Federal Reserve on Friday issued initial findings from its 2022 triennial payments study. The information shows how consumers and businesses chose to make noncash payments, using checks, different types of cards, and the automated clearinghouse (ACH). Additional details will be available as analysis is completed.The data show that the average values of consumers' and businesses' ACH, check, and card payments increased substantially from 2018 to 2021. The data also show that consumers and businesses made more noncash payments, leading to a greater total value of noncash payments in the same time period. Cards were used most frequently, and accounted for 84 percent of the increase in the number of payment transactions. The increase in total value, however, was driven almost entirely by the increase in the value of ACH payments.The Federal Reserve Payments Study is a collaborative effort of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and the Federal Reserve Board. The triennial study has been conducted every three years since 2001 with annual supplements since 2017. The study develops aggregate estimates using data collected from voluntary surveys of depository institutions, card networks, and other major payment processors.For media inquiries, please email [email protected] or call 202-452-2955.Note: On April 21, 2023, the press release was updated to correct the number for card payments’ contribution to the increase in the number of payment transactions from 98 to 84."

16,3/24/2023,"The Federal Reserve Board on Friday released the 2022 combined annual audited financial statements for the Reserve Banks. An independent public accounting firm engaged by the Board issued unqualified opinions, asserting that its audit found the financial statements for the Board and the Reserve Banks to be free of material misstatements in accordance with the applicable auditing standards. The Board released preliminary income and expense data earlier this year.Additionally, the Board released individual statements for the 12 Federal Reserve Banks, the Board, and 3 limited liability companies (LLCs) related to lending facilities established to support the Federal Reserve's pandemic response. The audited financial statements provide information about the assets, liabilities, and earnings of the Federal Reserve Banks, the Board, and the LLCs as of December 31, 2022.The Federal Reserve Act requires the Reserve Banks to remit excess earnings to the U.S. Treasury after providing for operating costs, payments of dividends, and any amount necessary to maintain surplus at the statutory limit. During a period when earnings are less than these costs, a deferred asset is recorded, representing a shortfall in earnings from the most recent point that remittances to the Treasury were suspended.During 2022, the Reserve Banks transferred $76.0 billion from weekly earnings as compared to $109 billion in 2021, and in the fall, they first suspended weekly remittances to the Treasury and began accumulating a deferred asset, which totaled $16.6 billion by the end of the year. A deferred asset has no implications for the Federal Reserve's conduct of monetary policy, its operations, or its ability to meet its financial obligations.Additional information in the audited financial statements of the Reserve Banks includes:Total assets of the Reserve Banks as of December 31, 2022, were approximately $8.6 trillion, a decrease of $187.0 billion from the previous year. Total assets were composed primarily of $8.4 trillion of U.S. Treasury securities, and federal agency and government-sponsored enterprise mortgage-backed securities acquired through open market operations. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York provides additional detailed information about open market operations and securities holdings on an ongoing basis on its website.The Board engaged KPMG LLP to audit the financial statements of the Reserve Banks and the LLCs in accordance with standards issued by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, and the audit of the Board's financial statements was also conducted in accordance with the Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards. KPMG also conducted audits of internal controls over financial reporting for the 12 individual Reserve Banks and the Board.The Federal Reserve System financial statements are available on the Federal Reserve Board's website.For media inquiries, please email [email protected] or call 202-452-2955."

Depositors will have access to all of their money starting Monday, March 13.

25,3/12/2023,"To support American businesses and households, the Federal Reserve Board on Sunday announced it will make available additional funding to eligible depository institutions to help assure banks have the ability to meet the needs of all their depositors. This action will bolster the capacity of the banking system to safeguard deposits and ensure the ongoing provision of money and credit to the economy.The Federal Reserve is prepared to address any liquidity pressures that may arise.The additional funding will be made available through the creation of a new Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP), offering loans of up to one year in length to banks, savings associations, credit unions, and other eligible depository institutions pledging U.S. Treasuries, agency debt and mortgage-backed securities, and other qualifying assets as collateral. These assets will be valued at par. The BTFP will be an additional source of liquidity against high-quality securities, eliminating an institution's need to quickly sell those securities in times of stress.With approval of the Treasury Secretary, the Department of the Treasury will make available up to $25 billion from the Exchange Stabilization Fund as a backstop for the BTFP. The Federal Reserve does not anticipate that it will be necessary to draw on these backstop funds.After receiving a recommendation from the boards of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Federal Reserve, Treasury Secretary Yellen, after consultation with the President, approved actions to enable the FDIC to complete its resolutions of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in a manner that fully protects all depositors, both insured and uninsured. These actions will reduce stress across the financial system, support financial stability and minimize any impact on businesses, households, taxpayers, and the broader economy.The Board is carefully monitoring developments in financial markets. The capital and liquidity positions of the U.S. banking system are strong and the U.S. financial system is resilient.Depository institutions may obtain liquidity against a wide range of collateral through the discount window, which remains open and available. In addition, the discount window will apply the same margins used for the securities eligible for the BTFP, further increasing lendable value at the window.The Board is closely monitoring conditions across the financial system and is prepared to use its full range of tools to support households and businesses, and will take additional steps as appropriate.For media inquiries, please email [email protected] or call 202-452-2955.Term Sheet: Bank Term Funding Program (PDF)"

31,2/24/2023,"The federal bank regulatory agencies today reported in the 2022 Shared National Credit (SNC) report that credit quality associated with large syndicated bank loans improved in 2022, but noted the results do not fully reflect increasing interest rates and softening economic conditions that began to impact borrowers in the second half of 2022.Overall, the report finds that credit risks for syndicated loans—large loans originated by multiple banks—were moderate at the end of the review period. While risks to borrowers impacted by COVID-19 have declined, they remain high for leveraged loans, as well as the entertainment, recreation, and transportation services industries.The 2022 review, which evaluates the quality of large, syndicated loans, was conducted by the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and reflects the examination of SNC loans originated on or before June 30, 2022. Consistent with the approach taken in 2021, it focused on borrowers in five industries that were affected significantly by the pandemic: entertainment and recreation; oil and gas; commercial real estate; retail; and transportation services.The 2022 SNC portfolio included 6,214 borrowers, totaling $5.9 trillion in commitments, an increase of 13.9 percent from a year ago. The percentage of loans that deserve management's close attention (loans rated non-pass, including special mention and classified SNC commitments) decreased from 10.6 percent of total commitments to 7.0 percent year over year. Nearly half of total SNC commitments are leveraged loans, and commitments to borrowers in industries affected by COVID-19 represent about one-fifth of total SNC commitments. For leveraged borrowers that also operate in COVID-19 affected industries, non-pass loans decreased to 18.9 percent, but remain above the 13.5 percent observed in 2019. While U.S. banks hold nearly 45 percent of all SNC commitments, they hold only 21 percent of non-pass loans.2022 SNC Program Review Report (PDF)"

37,2/9/2023,"The Federal Reserve Board on Thursday released the hypothetical scenarios for its annual stress test, which helps ensure that large banks are able to lend to households and businesses even in a severe recession. This year, 23 banks will be tested against a severe global recession with heightened stress in both commercial and residential real estate markets, as well as in corporate debt markets.The Board's stress test evaluates the resilience of large banks by estimating losses, net revenue, and capital levels—which provide a cushion against losses—under hypothetical recession scenarios that extend two years into the future. The scenarios are not forecasts and should not be interpreted as predictions of future economic conditions.In the 2023 stress test scenario, the U.S. unemployment rate rises nearly 6-1/2 percentage points, to a peak of 10 percent. The increase in the unemployment rate is accompanied by severe market volatility, a significant widening of corporate bond spreads, and a collapse in asset prices.In addition to the hypothetical scenario, banks with large trading operations will be tested against a global market shock component that primarily stresses their trading positions. The global market shock component is a set of hypothetical shocks to a large set of risk factors reflecting market distress and heightened uncertainty.For the first time, this year's stress test will feature an additional exploratory market shock to the trading books of the largest and most complex banks, with firm-specific results released. This exploratory market shock will not contribute to the capital requirements set by this year's stress test and will be used to expand the Board's understanding of the largest banks' resilience by considering more than a single hypothetical stress event. The Board also will use the results of the exploratory market shock to assess the potential of multiple scenarios to capture a wider array of risks in future stress test exercises.The table below shows the components of the test that apply to each bank, based on data as of the third quarter of 2022.

40,2/1/2023,"Recent indicators point to modest growth in spending and production. Job gains have been robust in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low. Inflation has eased somewhat but remains elevated.Russia's war against Ukraine is causing tremendous human and economic hardship and is contributing to elevated global uncertainty. The Committee is highly attentive to inflation risks.The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. In support of these goals, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 4-1/2 to 4-3/4 percent. The Committee anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time. In determining the extent of future increases in the target range, the Committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments. In addition, the Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities, as described in its previously announced plans. The Committee is strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent objective.In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.Voting for the monetary policy action were Jerome H.

41,1/27/2023,"The Federal Reserve Board on Friday announced its denial of the application by Custodia Bank, Inc., Cheyenne, Wyoming, to become a member of the Federal Reserve System. The Board has concluded that the firm's application as submitted is inconsistent with the required factors under the law.Custodia is a special purpose depository institution, chartered by the state of Wyoming, which does not have federal deposit insurance. The firm proposed to engage in novel and untested crypto activities that include issuing a crypto asset on open, public and/or decentralized networks.The firm's novel business model and proposed focus on crypto-assets presented significant safety and soundness risks. The Board has previously made clear that such crypto activities are highly likely to be inconsistent with safe and sound banking practices. The Board also found that Custodia's risk management framework was insufficient to address concerns regarding the heightened risks associated with its proposed crypto activities, including its ability to mitigate money laundering and terrorism financing risks.In light of these and other concerns, the firm's application as submitted was inconsistent with the factors the Board is required to evaluate by law.

The equal treatment will promote a level playing field and limit regulatory arbitrage.In addition, the statement reiterates that banks must both ensure that the activities they engage in are allowed under the law, and conduct their business in a safe and sound manner. For instance, a bank should have in place risk management processes, internal controls, and information systems that are appropriate and adequate for the nature, scope, and risks of its activities.In recent years, the Board has received a number of inquiries, notifications, and proposals from banks regarding potential engagement in novel and unprecedented activities, including those involving crypto-assets. In response, the Board's statement specifies how it will evaluate such inquiries, consistent with longstanding practice. Today's action would not prohibit a state member bank, or prospective applicant, from providing safekeeping services, in a custodial capacity, for crypto-assets if conducted in a safe and sound manner and in compliance with consumer, anti-money laundering, and anti-terrorist financing laws.The statement is effective upon publication in the Federal Register.For media inquiries, please email [email protected] or call 202-452-2955.Board memo: Policy Statement on Section 9(13) of the Federal Reserve Act (PDF)Federal Register notice: Policy Statement on Section 9(13) of the Federal Reserve Act"

The six loans totaled approximately $1.1 million.Under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, Small Business Administration-approved lenders like Popular Bank were allowed to provide PPP loans to qualified small businesses negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, but were required to follow their anti-money laundering policies.

To support the exercise's goals of deepening understanding of climate risk-management practices and building capacity to identify, measure, monitor, and manage climate-related financial risks, the Board will gather qualitative and quantitative information over the course of the pilot, including details on governance and risk management practices, measurement methodologies, risk metrics, data challenges, and lessons learned.""The Fed has narrow, but important, responsibilities regarding climate-related financial risks – to ensure that banks understand and manage their material risks, including the financial risks from climate change,"" Vice Chair for Supervision Michael S. Barr said. ""The exercise we are launching today will advance the ability of supervisors and banks to analyze and manage emerging climate-related financial risks.""The pilot exercise includes physical risk scenarios with different levels of severity affecting residential and commercial real estate portfolios in the Northeastern United States and directs each bank to consider the impact of additional physical risk shocks for their real estate portfolios in another region of the country. For transition risks, banks will consider the impact on corporate loans and commercial real estate portfolios using a scenario based on current policies and one based on reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. These scenarios are not forecasts or policy prescriptions, but can be used to build understanding of climate-related financial risks.The Board anticipates publishing insights gained from the pilot at an aggregate level, reflecting what has been learned about climate risk management practices and how insights from scenario analysis will help identify potential risks and promote effective risk management practices. No firm-specific information will be released.Climate scenario analysis is distinct and separate from bank stress tests. The Board's stress tests are designed to assess whether large banks have enough capital to continue lending to households and businesses during a severe recession.

48,1/13/2023,"The Federal Reserve Board on Friday announced preliminary financial information indicating that the Federal Reserve Banks had estimated net income of $58.4 billion in 2022. The 2022 audited Reserve Bank financial statements are expected to be published in coming months and may include adjustments to these preliminary unaudited results.The Federal Reserve Act requires the Reserve Banks to remit excess earnings to the U.S. Treasury after providing for operating costs, payments of dividends, and any amount necessary to maintain surplus. During a period when earnings are not sufficient to provide for those costs, a deferred asset is recorded. The deferred asset is the amount of net earnings the Reserve Banks will need to realize before their remittances to the U.S. Treasury resume.During 2022, Reserve Banks transferred $76.0 billion from weekly earnings to the U.S. Treasury, and, in September 2022, most Reserve Banks suspended weekly remittances to the Treasury and started accumulating a deferred asset, which totaled $18.8 billion by the end of the year. A deferred asset has no implications for the Federal Reserve's conduct of monetary policy or its ability to meet its financial obligations.Additional information related to 2022 preliminary financial results for the Reserve Banks include:The attached chart illustrates the amount the Reserve Banks distributed to the U.S. Treasury from 2013 through 2022 (estimated).For media inquiries, please email [email protected] or call 202-452-2955."

57,12/19/2022,"The Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation today announced the 2023 updated asset-size thresholds used to define ""small bank"" and ""intermediate small bank"" under their Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) regulations.Annual adjustments to these asset-size thresholds are based on the average change in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W), which is a measure of inflation.As a result of the 8.60 percent increase in the CPI-W for the period ending in November 2022, the definitions of small and intermediate small banks for CRA examinations will change as follows:The CRA regulations establish the framework and criteria by which the relevant agencies assess a financial institution's record of helping to meet the credit needs of its community, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with safe and sound operations.  Financial institutions are evaluated under different CRA examination procedures based upon their asset-size classification. For example, banks meeting the small and intermediate small bank asset-size thresholds are not subject to the reporting requirements applicable to large banks unless they choose to be evaluated as a large bank.These asset-size thresholds are effective January 1, 2023. A list of the current and historical asset-size thresholds is available here.Federal Register notice: Community Reinvestment Act Regulations Asset-Size Thresholds"
58,12/16/2022,"The Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation announced today the results of their joint review of the resolution plans for 71 domestic and foreign banking organizations. Resolution plans must describe a financial company's strategy for rapid and orderly resolution in bankruptcy in the event of its material financial distress or failure.The agencies identified two deficiencies in the 2021 plan submission of Credit Suisse AG, which pertain to resolution planning cash flow forecasting capabilities and governance for their U.S. operations. As detailed in a feedback letter, the agencies are requiring the firm to resubmit a revised resolution plan for its U.S. operations by May 31, 2023, that demonstrates the governance weaknesses have been addressed and in its next plan due by July 2024, that demonstrates the cash flow forecasting weaknesses have been remediated.The agencies also identified a shortcoming in BNP Paribas' 2021 plan submission. The shortcoming is related to the continuity in resolution of the bank's securities repurchase agreement activity for their U.S. operations. A feedback letter to the firm describes the specific weaknesses resulting in the shortcoming and the actions required by the agencies.The agencies did not identify shortcomings or deficiencies in the plans from the other banking organizations.

59,12/16/2022,"The Federal Reserve Board on Friday adopted a final rule that implements the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act by identifying benchmark rates based on SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate) that will replace LIBOR in certain financial contracts after June 30, 2023. The final rule is substantially similar to the proposal with certain clarifying changes made in response to comments.LIBOR, formerly known as the London Interbank Offered Rate, was the dominant benchmark rate used in financial contracts for decades. However, it was fragile and subject to manipulation, and U.S. dollar LIBOR panels will end after June 30, 2023.Congress enacted the LIBOR Act to provide a uniform, nationwide solution for so-called tough legacy contracts that do not have clear and practicable provisions for replacing LIBOR after June 30, 2023. As required by the law, the final rule identifies replacement benchmark rates based on SOFR to replace overnight, one-month, three-month, six-month, and 12-month LIBOR in contracts subject to the Act. These contracts include U.S. contracts that do not mature before LIBOR ends and that lack adequate ""fallback"" provisions that would replace LIBOR with a practicable replacement benchmark rate.In response to comments, the final rule restates safe harbor protections contained in the LIBOR Act for selection or use of the replacement benchmark rate selected by the Board, and clarifies who would be considered a ""determining person"" able to choose to use the replacement benchmark rate selected by the Board for use for certain LIBOR contracts. Consistent with the LIBOR Act, the final rule also ensures that LIBOR contracts adopting a benchmark rate selected by the Board will not be interrupted or terminated following LIBOR's replacement.The final rule will be effective 30 days after publication in the Federal Register.For media inquiries, please email [email protected] or call (202) 452-2955.Note: On December 16, 2022, the headline for this release was updated to correct the date when LIBOR will be replaced in certain contracts.

63,12/14/2022,"Recent indicators point to modest growth in spending and production. Job gains have been robust in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low. Inflation remains elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher food and energy prices, and broader price pressures.Russia's war against Ukraine is causing tremendous human and economic hardship. The war and related events are contributing to upward pressure on inflation and are weighing on global economic activity. The Committee is highly attentive to inflation risks.The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. In support of these goals, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent. The Committee anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time. In determining the pace of future increases in the target range, the Committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments. In addition, the Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities, as described in the Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve's Balance Sheet that were issued in May. The Committee is strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent objective.In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals.

67,12/2/2022,"The Federal Reserve Board on Friday finalized clarifying and technical updates to its policy governing the provision of intraday credit to healthy depository institutions with accounts at the Federal Reserve Banks. The updates expand access to collateralized intraday credit under the Policy on Payment System Risk (known as PSR policy) while providing greater clarity to institutions, streamlining administrative requirements, and supporting the launch of the FedNow℠ Service. The final updates are substantially similar to the proposal issued in May 2021.To ensure the smooth functioning of payment and settlement systems, Reserve Banks provide temporary intraday credit to a healthy depository institution when its account has a negative balance during the business day. The PSR policy establishes limits on the amount of an institution's uncollateralized intraday credit and allows certain institutions to request additional collateralized credit.Like the proposal, the final updates expand the eligibility of institutions to request collateralized intraday credit and reduce the required administrative steps. They also clarify eligibility standards for accessing uncollateralized intraday credit. In addition, the final updates modify the PSR policy to support the launch of the FedNow Service, for example, by redefining the term ""business day"" to reflect the FedNow Service's 24x7x365 operations. The final updates also simplify and incorporate the related Overnight Overdrafts policy into the PSR policy.The final updates related to the deployment of the FedNow Service and the Overnight Overdrafts policy will become effective when Reserve Banks begin processing live transactions for the FedNow Service, which is targeted for launch in May-July 2023.

Resolution plans must describe a financial company's strategy for rapid and orderly resolution in bankruptcy in the event of its material financial distress or failure. The agencies identified a shortcoming in Citigroup Inc.'s resolution plan and did not identify any other shortcomings or deficiencies in the plans from the other banking organizations.A shortcoming is a weakness that raises questions about the feasibility of the plan and could result in additional requirements if not corrected, but is not as severe as a deficiency. In Citigroup's resolution plan, the agencies found a shortcoming related to data quality and data management concerns previously identified by the Board in its October 2020 enforcement action.The agencies previously identified shortcomings in the 2019 plans of Bank of America Corporation, The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, State Street Corporation, and Wells Fargo & Company, related to the ability of each firm to reliably produce, in stressed conditions, data needed to execute its resolution strategy. The agencies determined that the 2021 resolution plans of these firms successfully addressed those shortcomings.The agencies have provided feedback letters to each of the firms. The letters note continued development of firms' resolution strategies and capabilities and the expectation that work will continue. The feedback letters also note the expectation that the next plan review will include expanded testing of the firm's resolution capabilities.

Pursuant to statute, the updates specify that debit card issuers should enable at least two payment card networks to process all debit card transactions, including ""card-not-present"" transactions, such as online payments.1 The final rule is substantially similar to the proposal issued last year.By law, the Board is required to make rules ensuring that debit card issuers give merchants the opportunity to choose between at least two unaffiliated networks when routing debit card transactions. When the Board initially issued the rule in July 2011, the market had not developed solutions to broadly support multiple networks for card-not-present debit card transactions. Since that time, technology has evolved to address these barriers. However, some debit card issuers have not yet enabled at least two unaffiliated networks for merchants to choose between when routing such transactions. This issue has become increasingly pronounced because of continued growth in online payments.The final rule underscores that debit card issuers should enable at least two unaffiliated networks to process debit card transactions. Importantly, input received in connection with the proposal suggests that many debit card issuers, and especially most community bank issuers, are already compliant with the final rule. In response to public comments, the final rule also includes certain changes that make it easier for debit card issuers to determine whether they are in compliance with the final rule. The final rule will encourage competition between networks and incentivize them to improve their fraud-prevention capabilities.The final rule does not modify requirements concerning interchange fees. As previously stated, the Board will continue to review interchange fee requirements in light of the most recent debit card industry cost data collected by the Board, and may propose to modify these requirements in the future.The final rule will be effective July 1, 2023.For media inquiries, please email [email protected] or call 202-452-2955.1.

91,9/30/2022,"The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Federal Reserve Board on Friday jointly announced they anticipate issuing guidance to help certain large banks further develop their resolution plans.Resolution plans, required by the Dodd-Frank Act and commonly known as ""living wills,"" describe a financial company's strategy for rapid and orderly resolution under bankruptcy in the event of financial distress or failure.The guidance from the agencies would apply to Category II and Category III banking organizations—generally those with more than $250 billion in total assets but that are not global systemically important banks—and which have not already received guidance. Larger and more complex banks are already subject to guidance from the agencies. The agencies will seek and consider public comment on the guidance before it is finalized.Also on Friday, the agencies announced that they did not find any ""shortcomings"" or ""deficiencies"" in the 2021 resolution plan of Truist Financial Corporation but did issue feedback to the firm on its plan. Deficiencies are weaknesses that could undermine the feasibility of the company's resolution plan while a shortcoming is a weakness that raises questions about the feasibility of a firm's plan but is not as severe as a deficiency.Truist received a feedback letter providing additional information on areas of improvement for its next plan. Its next resolution plan is due on or before July 1, 2024."
92,9/29/2022,"The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the National Credit Union Administration, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and state financial regulators, collectively the agencies, recognize the serious impact of Hurricanes Fiona and Ian on the customers and operations of many financial institutions and will provide appropriate regulatory assistance to affected institutions subject to their supervision. The agencies encourage institutions operating in the affected areas to meet the financial services needs of their communities.A complete list of the affected disaster areas can be found at https://www.fema.gov/disasters.Lending: The agencies encourage financial institutions to work constructively with borrowers in communities affected by Hurricanes Fiona and Ian. Prudent efforts to adjust or alter terms on existing loans in affected areas are supported by the agencies and should not be subject to examiner criticism. In accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, institutions should individually evaluate modifications of existing loans to determine whether they represent troubled debt restructurings or modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, as applicable. In making this evaluation, institutions should consider the facts and circumstances of each borrower and modification. In supervising institutions affected by Hurricanes Fiona and Ian, the agencies will consider the unusual circumstances these institutions face. The agencies recognize that efforts to work with borrowers in communities under stress can be consistent with safe-and-sound practices as well as in the public interest.Temporary Facilities: The agencies understand that many financial institutions face staffing, power, telecommunications, and other challenges in re-opening facilities after Hurricanes Fiona and Ian. In cases in which operational challenges persist, the primary federal and/or state regulator will expedite, as appropriate, any request to operate temporary facilities to provide more convenient availability of services to those affected by Hurricanes Fiona and Ian. In most cases, a telephone notice to the primary federal and/or state regulator will suffice initially to start the approval process, with necessary written notification being submitted shortly thereafter.Publishing Requirements: The agencies understand that the damage caused by Hurricanes Fiona and Ian may affect compliance with publishing and other requirements for branch closings, relocations, and temporary facilities under various laws and regulations. Institutions experiencing disaster-related difficulties in complying with any publishing or other requirements should contact their primary federal and/or state regulator.Regulatory Reporting Requirements: Institutions affected by Hurricanes Fiona and Ian that expect to encounter difficulty meeting the agencies' reporting requirements should contact their primary federal and/or state regulator to discuss their situation. The agencies do not expect to assess penalties or take other supervisory action against institutions that take reasonable and prudent steps to comply with the agencies' regulatory reporting requirements if those institutions are unable to fully satisfy those requirements because of Hurricanes Fiona and Ian.The agencies' staffs stand ready to work with affected institutions that may be experiencing problems fulfilling their reporting responsibilities, taking into account each institution's particular circumstances, including the status of its reporting and recordkeeping systems and the condition of its underlying financial records.Community Reinvestment Act (CRA): Financial institutions may receive CRA consideration for community development loans, investments, or services that revitalize or stabilize federally designated disaster areas in their assessment areas or in the states or regions that include their assessment areas. For additional information, refer to the Interagency Questions and Answers Regarding Community Reinvestment at https://www.ffiec.gov/cra/qnadoc.htm.Investments: Institutions are encouraged to monitor municipal securities and loans affected by Hurricanes Fiona and Ian. The agencies realize local government projects may be negatively affected by the disaster and encourage institutions to engage in appropriate monitoring and take prudent efforts to stabilize such investments.For more information, refer to the Interagency Supervisory Examiner Guidance for Institutions Affected by a Major Disaster, which is available as follows:CSBS: https://www.csbs.org/interagency-supervisory-examiner-guidance-institutions-affected-major-disaster (PDF)FDIC: https://www.fdic.gov/news/news/financial/2017/fil17062.htmlFRB: https://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/srletters/sr1714a1.pdf (PDF)OCC: https://www.occ.gov/news-issuances/bulletins/2017/bulletin-2017-61.htmlNCUA: https://www.ncua.gov/regulation-supervision/letters-credit-unions-other-guidance/examiner-guidance-institutions-affected-major-disaster"
93,9/29/2022,"The Federal Reserve Board on Thursday announced that six of the nation's largest banks will participate in a pilot climate scenario analysis exercise designed to enhance the ability of supervisors and firms to measure and manage climate-related financial risks. Scenario analysis—in which the resilience of financial institutions is assessed under different hypothetical climate scenarios—is an emerging tool to assess climate-related financial risks, and there will be no capital or supervisory implications from the pilot.The pilot exercise will be launched in early 2023 and is expected to conclude around the end of the year. At the beginning of the exercise, the Board will publish details of the climate, economic, and financial variables that make up the climate scenario narratives.Over the course of the pilot, participating firms will analyze the impact of the scenarios on specific portfolios and business strategies. The Board will then review firm analysis and engage with those firms to build capacity to manage climate-related financial risks. The Board anticipates publishing insights gained from the pilot at an aggregate level, reflecting what has been learned about climate risk management practices and how insights from scenario analysis will help identify potential risks and promote risk management practices. No firm-specific information will be released.Climate scenario analysis is distinct and separate from bank stress tests. The Board's stress tests are designed to assess whether large banks have enough capital to continue lending to households and businesses during a severe recession. The climate scenario analysis exercise, on the other hand, is exploratory in nature and does not have capital consequences. By considering a range of possible future climate pathways and associated economic and financial developments, scenario analysis can assist firms and supervisors in understanding how climate-related financial risks may manifest and differ from historical experience.The banks in the pilot exercise are Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, and Wells Fargo. In coming months, the Board will provide additional details on how the exercise will be conducted and the scenarios that will be used in the pilot.For media inquiries, please email [email protected] or call 202-452-2955."

97,9/23/2022,"The Federal Reserve Board on Friday invited comment on updates to operational risk-management requirements for certain systemically important financial market utilities (FMUs) supervised by the Board. FMUs provide essential infrastructure to clear and settle payments and other financial transactions upon which the financial markets and the broader economy rely to function effectively. The proposed updates generally provide more specificity to the existing requirements.The broad operational risk, technology, and regulatory landscape in which FMUs operate has evolved significantly since the Board last updated its risk management requirements for FMUs in 2014. New challenges have emerged, such as the global pandemic and cyber events, while new technological advancements may improve resilience. The proposed changes would promote effective risk management in this rapidly evolving risk environment.""In light of the rapidly evolving risk landscape, the proposed changes will help ensure that key financial market utilities operate with a high level of resilience and remain a source of strength for the financial system,"" said Vice Chair Lael Brainard.The proposal addresses four key areas: incident management and notification; business continuity management and planning; third-party risk management; and review and testing of operational risk management measures. For example, the proposal would explicitly require FMUs to establish an incident management framework and would emphasize the need for FMUs to continue to advance their cyber resilience capabilities. The proposed updates are largely consistent with existing measures that FMUs take to comply with the current requirements.Comments on the proposed changes must be submitted within 60 days from the date of publication in the Federal Register.For media inquiries, email [email protected] or call (202) 452-2955.Federal Register notice: Financial Market UtilitiesBoard Memo (PDF)"

107,8/16/2022,"The Federal Reserve Board on Tuesday announced that it has fined EagleBank, of Bethesda, Maryland, $9.5 million for violation of the Board's insider lending regulation. The bank improperly extended credit to entities owned or controlled by its then-CEO and Chairman, Ronald D. Paul.The Board found that EagleBank had deficient internal controls over insider lending practices between 2015 and 2018, which allowed the bank to extend credit totaling nearly $100 million to entities that Paul owned or controlled, including certain family trusts, without making appropriate disclosures to, or obtaining required approvals from, a majority of the bank's board of directors. These internal control deficiencies also extended to the bank's supervision of lending staff, who permitted Paul to participate in matters in which he had a conflict of interest. The Board also cited EagleBank for third-party risk management deficiencies over the same period that resulted in inadequate oversight of contracts between the bank and a local government official.In addition, the Board announced that it has permanently barred Paul from employment in the banking industry and assessed a $90,000 fine against him for his central role in the bank's violations of law and unsafe and unsound practices.In conjunction with these actions by the Board, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission today announced its own settlement of actions against Paul and EagleBank's holding company, Eagle Bancorp, Inc. In total, the bank and holding company will pay approximately $22.9 million and Paul will pay approximately $521,000 to settle the agency actions.The Board previously barred EagleBank's former General Counsel Laurence E.

Based on the information gathered to date, it appears that these representations likely misled and were relied upon by customers who placed their funds with Voyager and do not have immediate access to their funds.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Act, however, prohibits any person from representing or implying that an uninsured deposit is insured or from knowingly misrepresenting the extent and manner in which a deposit liability, obligation, certificate, or share is insured under that Act. The FDIC is authorized to enforce this prohibition against any person.Voyager maintains a deposit account for the benefit of its customers at Metropolitan Commercial Bank, which is supervised by the Board. Voyager is not itself insured by the FDIC, though, and so customers who invested through its cryptocurrency platform would not receive insurance coverage in the event of Voyager's failure.The FDIC deposit insurance program protects customers in the event of the failure of an FDIC-insured bank. To determine if an institution is FDIC-insured, you can ask a representative of the institution, look for the FDIC sign at the institution, or use the FDIC's BankFind tool.

The proposal implements the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act, which Congress enacted earlier this year.LIBOR, formerly known as the London Interbank Offered Rate, was the dominant reference rate used in financial contracts in recent decades, but the rate in its current form will be discontinued after June 30, 2023. In response to the planned end of LIBOR, Congress enacted the LIBOR Act to provide a uniform, nationwide solution for replacing references to LIBOR in existing contracts without adequate fallback provisions, which are provisions in the contract related to the identification of an alternative reference rate.Consistent with the law, the proposal would replace references to LIBOR in certain contracts with the applicable Board-selected replacement rate after June 30, 2023. The contracts include those governed by domestic law that do not mature before LIBOR ends and that lack adequate fallback provisions.The proposal identifies separate Board-selected replacement rates for derivatives transactions, contracts where a government-sponsored enterprise is a party, and all other affected contracts. As required by the law, each proposed replacement rate is based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate.Comments on the attached proposal will be accepted for 30 days after publication in the Federal Register.For media inquiries, please email [email protected] or call (202) 452-2955.Federal Register notice: Regulation Implementing the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act"

130,6/23/2022,"The Federal Reserve Board on Thursday released the results of its annual bank stress test, which showed that banks continue to have strong capital levels, allowing them to continue lending to households and businesses during a severe recession.All banks tested remained above their minimum capital requirements, despite total projected losses of $612 billion. Under stress, the aggregate common equity capital ratio—which provides a cushion against losses—is projected to decline by 2.7 percentage points to a minimum of 9.7 percent, which is still more than double the minimum requirement.The Board's stress tests help ensure that large banks can support the economy during economic downturns. The tests evaluate the resilience of large banks by estimating their capital levels, losses, revenue and expenses under hypothetical scenarios over nine future quarters.This year's hypothetical scenario is tougher than the 2021 test, by design, and includes a severe global recession with substantial stress in commercial real estate and corporate debt markets. The unemployment rate rises by 5-3/4 percentage points to a peak of 10 percent and GDP declines commensurately. Asset prices decline sharply, with a nearly 40 percent decline in commercial real estate prices and a 55 percent decline in stock prices.Total losses were largely driven by more than $450 billion in loan losses and $100 billion in trading and counterparty losses. This year, larger banks saw an increase of over $50 billion in losses compared to the 2021 test. Additionally, the aggregate 2.7 percent decline in capital is slightly larger than the 2.4 percent decline from last year's test but is comparable to recent years. The disclosure document contains additional information, including firm-specific results and figures.The individual bank results from the stress test will factor directly into a bank's capital requirements, mandating each bank to hold enough capital to survive a severe recession. If a bank does not stay above its capital requirements, it is subject to automatic restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments.For media inquiries, please email [email protected] or call 202-452-2955.2022 Federal Reserve Stress Test Results"

137,6/15/2022,"Overall economic activity appears to have picked up after edging down in the first quarter. Job gains have been robust in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low. Inflation remains elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher energy prices, and broader price pressures.The invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship. The invasion and related events are creating additional upward pressure on inflation and are weighing on global economic activity. In addition, COVID-related lockdowns in China are likely to exacerbate supply chain disruptions. The Committee is highly attentive to inflation risks.The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. In support of these goals, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 1‑1/2 to 1-3/4 percent and anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate. In addition, the Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities, as described in the Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve's Balance Sheet that were issued in May. The Committee is strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent objective.In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.Voting for the monetary policy action were Jerome H. Powell, Chair; John C. Williams, Vice Chair; Michelle W. Bowman; Lael Brainard; James Bullard; Lisa D. Cook; Patrick Harker; Philip N. Jefferson; Loretta J. Mester; and Christopher J. Waller.

I am confident these tools will assist our smaller banks enabling them to prioritize serving the financial needs of their communities and customers,"" said Governor Miki Bowman.The ELE tool will be launched during an ""Ask the Fed"" webinar on June 16, 2022. The session is intended for community financial institutions. Registration information is available at www.askthefed.org.

The report draws from the Board's ninth annual Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking, or SHED, which was conducted in October and November of last year before the increase in COVID-19 cases from the Omicron variant and other changes to the economic landscape in recent months. The report, fact sheet, downloadable data, data visualizations, and a video summarizing the survey's findings may be found here.The report indicates that self-reported financial well-being reached its highest level since the SHED began in 2013. In the fourth quarter of 2021, 78 percent of adults reported either doing okay or living comfortably financially. Financial well-being also increased among all the racial and ethnic groups measured in the survey, with a particularly large increase among Hispanic adults. Parents were one group who reported large gains in financial well-being with three-fourths saying they were doing at least okay financially, up 8 percentage points from 2020.""The SHED results provide valuable insight into Americans' financial conditions during the late fall of 2021. This important perspective helps the Federal Reserve better understand the economic challenges that existed during that phase of the pandemic recovery,"" said Federal Reserve Board Governor Michelle W. Bowman.The share of adults who reported that they would cover a $400 emergency expense using cash or its equivalent similarly increased to the highest level since the start of the survey—68 percent—and was up from 50 percent when the survey began in 2013. Eleven percent of adults could not pay the expense by any method.In addition, the survey presents insight into the experiences of workers through the pandemic. Fifteen percent of workers said they were in a different job than 12 months earlier. Most who changed jobs said the job change was an improvement. Remote work also continued to evolve in 2021. During the week of the survey in late 2021, 22 percent of employees worked entirely from home, down from 29 percent in late 2020, but well above the 7 percent who worked entirely from home before the pandemic. Most employees who worked from home preferred to do so, often citing work-life balance and less time commuting. Those working from home indicated that they would be about as likely to look for a new job if required to return to the office as if their employer instituted a pay freeze.In addition, the report explores families' experiences related to banking and credit, income, housing, retirement, student loans, and retirement alongside several new topics, such as the use of emerging financial products including cryptocurrencies and ""Buy Now, Pay Later"" services.The survey included 11,000 adult respondents.For media inquiries, please email [email protected] or call (202) 452-2955.Economic Well-Being of U.S. Households in 2021Economic Well-Being of U.S. Households in 2021 Fact Sheet (PDF)"

160,5/4/2022,"Although overall economic activity edged down in the first quarter, household spending and business fixed investment remained strong. Job gains have been robust in recent months, and the unemployment rate has declined substantially. Inflation remains elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher energy prices, and broader price pressures.The invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship. The implications for the U.S. economy are highly uncertain. The invasion and related events are creating additional upward pressure on inflation and are likely to weigh on economic activity. In addition, COVID-related lockdowns in China are likely to exacerbate supply chain disruptions. The Committee is highly attentive to inflation risks.The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. With appropriate firming in the stance of monetary policy, the Committee expects inflation to return to its 2 percent objective and the labor market to remain strong. In support of these goals, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 3/4 to 1 percent and anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate. In addition, the Committee decided to begin reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities on June 1, as described in the Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve's Balance Sheet that were issued in conjunction with this statement.In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.Voting for the monetary policy action were Jerome H.

The Federal Reserve Board's report, Economic Well-Being of U.S. Households in 2020, which was released on Monday, found a larger share of adults were worse off in 2020 than in previous years of the survey. This change occurred broadly across the population, but not all groups fared similarly.Despite the increase in the share of Americans doing worse off financially, most believed they were still at least doing ""okay"" financially overall. Seventy-five percent of adults were either doing okay or living comfortably in November, which was unchanged from 2019 after having fluctuated through the year. However, not all groups have fared similarly through the pandemic, and persistent disparities in well-being across education and race remained.Adults with at least a bachelor's degree were much more likely to report doing at least okay financially (89 percent) than those with less than a high school degree (45 percent). This gap increased to 44 percentage points in 2020 from 34 percentage points in 2019. In 2020, less than two-thirds of Black and Hispanic adults were doing at least okay financially, compared with 80 percent of White adults and 84 percent of Asian adults. The gap in financial well-being between White adults and Black and Hispanic adults has grown by 4 percentage points since 2017.The report draws from the Board's eighth annual Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking (SHED), which examines the economic well-being and financial lives of U.S. adults and their families. The 2020 survey of over 11,000 adults was conducted in November of last year, offering a picture of how individuals were faring eight months after the onset of the pandemic. This year's report covers emerging issues brought on by pandemic-related disruptions and offers insights into how people viewed their longer-run financial circumstances, including how they relate to education, housing satisfaction, and retirement savings.""This new survey gives us valuable details about the financial challenges families have faced during the pandemic,"" said Federal Reserve Board Governor Michelle W. Bowman. ""Even as the economy has improved, we can certainly see that some are still struggling, especially those who lost their jobs and those with less education, many of whom fell further behind. Helping families and communities was a central goal of the Federal Reserve's response to the pandemic, and the SHED is providing valuable insight into the successes and ongoing challenges of Americans as they continue to experience its effects.""People who retained their jobs during the pandemic generally had stable or improving finances in 2020. However, those who suffered a layoff and an extended period of unemployment saw a deterioration of their financial circumstances. Layoffs during the pandemic were concentrated among workers with fewer financial resources, which further exacerbated pre-existing disparities in their financial well-being. Those who were laid off during the pandemic typically had a relatively small financial cushion to begin with, as less than two-thirds of those who were laid off said they were doing at least okay financially in late 2019, before experiencing job loss.The survey confirmed that the ability of parents to work was affected by disruptions in childcare and schooling. Twenty-two percent of all parents were either not working (9 percent) or were working less (13 percent) because of such disruptions. The 9 percent of parents who were not working translates into nearly 2 percentage points fewer adults who were working overall. The unexpected pandemic-related need for childcare particularly affected mothers, preventing them from entering or fully participating in the labor force. Black, Hispanic, and single mothers, as well as mothers with low incomes, were more likely not to be working or to be working less due to the disruption.Students of all ages were also affected by the pandemic since widespread school closures began in March 2020. Parents viewed online education less favorably than in-person education. Only 22 percent of parents of K-12 students taking online classes thought their youngest child was learning as much as they were with in-person classes, whereas 59 percent said they were not. Among college students taking classes online, 34 percent thought they were learning as much as they would in-person, compared with 43 percent who did not.Results from the survey reflect financial conditions in late 2020 during the pandemic and indicate the changing nature of families' experiences. Financial repercussions related to COVID-19 continue to evolve, and the Federal Reserve Board will continue to monitor them.The report, downloadable data, data visualizations, and a video summarizing the survey's findings may be found at: https://www.federalreserve.gov/consumerscommunities/shed.htm.For media inquiries, call (202) 452-2955"

183,5/14/2021,"The Federal Reserve Board on Friday announced the third extension of a rule to bolster the effectiveness of the Small Business Administration's (SBA) Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). Like the earlier extensions, this one will temporarily modify the Board's rules so that certain bank directors and shareholders can apply to their banks for PPP loans for their small businesses.To prevent favoritism, the Board limits the types and quantity of loans that bank directors, shareholders, officers, and businesses owned by these persons can receive from their affiliated banks. However, these limits have prevented some small business owners from accessing PPP loans—especially in rural areas.The SBA clarified last year that PPP lenders can make PPP loans to businesses owned by their directors and certain shareholders, subject to certain limits, and without favoritism. The Board's rule extension will allow those individuals to apply for PPP loans, consistent with SBA's rules and restrictions. The extension only applies to PPP loans.The Board is providing the rule extension for PPP loans made since March 31, and to allow banks to continue to make PPP loans to a broad range of small businesses within their communities. The SBA explicitly has prohibited banks from prioritizing or providing favorable processing time to PPP loan applications from a director or equity holder, and the Board will administer the rule extension accordingly.The rule extension, which is effective immediately, applies to PPP loans made from March 31 through June 30, 2021. The rule change will continue to apply if the PPP is extended, with the change ultimately sunsetting on March 31, 2022.

184,5/7/2021,"The Federal Reserve Board on Friday invited public comment on proposed changes to Regulation II (Debit Card Interchange Fees and Routing) to clarify that debit card issuers should enable, and allow merchants to choose from, at least two unaffiliated networks for card-not-present debit card transactions, such as online purchases. The Board views these clarifications of Regulation II's existing requirements as necessary in light of information indicating that often only one network is enabled for such transactions.Additionally, the Board published today a biennial report containing summary information on debit card transactions in 2019.Regulation II implements section 920 of the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (EFTA). Among other things, the regulation requires that there be at least two unaffiliated payment card networks enabled on a debit card to process debit card transactions. At the time the Board promulgated Regulation II, the market had not developed solutions to broadly support multiple networks over which merchants could choose to route card-not-present transactions. Although technology has subsequently evolved to address these barriers, data collected by the Board and information from industry participants indicate that two unaffiliated networks are often not available to process card-not-present debit card transactions because some issuers do not enable two networks for those transactions. The absence of at least two unaffiliated networks for card-not-present transactions forecloses the ability of merchants to choose between competing networks when routing such transactions, an issue that has become increasingly pronounced because of continued growth in online transactions, particularly in the COVID-19 environment.The proposed revisions would clarify that card-not-present transactions are a ""particular type of transaction"" for which two unaffiliated payment card networks must be available. The proposed revisions would further clarify the responsibility of the debit card issuer in ensuring that at least two unaffiliated networks have in fact been enabled to comply with the regulation.The Board also published today a report on debit card transactions in 2019, including information on volume and value, interchange fee revenue, certain issuer costs, and fraud losses. The report is the sixth in a series published every two years as prescribed by section 920 of the EFTA and summarizes information collected from debit card issuers subject to the interchange fee standard in Regulation II and payment card networks. Key highlights are provided at the beginning of the report. The Board will continue to review the parts of Regulation II that directly address interchange fees for certain electronic debit transactions in light of the most recent data collected by the Board pursuant to section 920 of the EFTA and may propose revisions in the future.The Board's Federal Register notice and report are attached.For media inquiries, please call 202-452-29552019 Interchange Fee Revenue, Covered Issuer Costs, and Covered Issuer and Merchant Fraud Losses Related to Debit Card Transactions (PDF)Federal Register notice: Debit Card Interchange Fees and RoutingBoard Memo: Proposed Amendments to Regulation II (Debit Card Interchange Fees and Routing) to Clarify the Prohibition on Network Exclusivity; Biennial Report on 2019 Interchange Fee Revenue, Covered Issuer Costs, and Covered Issuer and Merchant Fraud Losses Related to Debit Card Transactions (PDF)"
185,5/5/2021,"The Federal Reserve Board on Wednesday invited public comment on proposed guidelines to evaluate requests for accounts and payment services at Federal Reserve Banks (""Account Access Guidelines"").Recent years have seen the introduction of new financial products and delivery mechanisms for traditional banking services, notably leveraging emerging technologies, including from institutions with novel types of banking charters designed to support such innovation. To facilitate these activities, some such institutions have requested access to the payments system offered by Federal Reserve Banks. To help achieve the goal of applying a transparent and consistent process for all access requests, as well as considering the ramifications for the broader financial system, the Board is proposing Account Access Guidelines for the Reserve Banks to evaluate such requests. These guidelines take into account the Board's legal authority and reflect an analysis of its policy goals.""With technology driving rapid change in the payments landscape, the proposed Account Access Guidelines would ensure requests for access to the Federal Reserve payments system from novel institutions are evaluated in a consistent and transparent manner that promotes a safe, efficient, inclusive, and innovative payment system, consumer protection, and the safety and soundness of the banking system,"" said Federal Reserve Board Governor Lael Brainard.Comments will be accepted for 60 days after publication in the Federal Register.For media inquiries, please call 202-452-2955Federal Register notice: Proposed Guidelines for Evaluating Account and Services Requests (PDF)Board Memo: Proposed guidelines to evaluate requests for accounts and services at Federal Reserve Banks (PDF)"

187,4/28/2021,"The Federal Reserve is committed to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum employment and price stability goals.The COVID-19 pandemic is causing tremendous human and economic hardship across the United States and around the world. Amid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened. The sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic remain weak but have shown improvement. Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.The path of the economy will depend significantly on the course of the virus, including progress on vaccinations. The ongoing public health crisis continues to weigh on the economy, and risks to the economic outlook remain.The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. With inflation running persistently below this longer-run goal, the Committee will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer‑term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent. The Committee expects to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomes are achieved. The Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. In addition, the Federal Reserve will continue to increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency mortgage‑backed securities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward the Committee's maximum employment and price stability goals.

196,4/8/2021,"The Federal Reserve Board on Thursday requested public comment on a proposal to automate non-merger-related adjustments to member banks' subscriptions to Federal Reserve Bank capital stock. The automated process would eliminate the need for member banks to file applications to adjust their stock subscriptions—except in the context of mergers—and would significantly reduce the annual reporting burden.Regulation I, which governs the issuance and cancellation of capital stock by the Reserve Banks, currently requires that a member bank apply to adjust its stock subscription at least annually and sometimes quarterly. A member bank determines its required stock subscription based on its capital and surplus (or total deposit liabilities for a mutual savings bank) as reported in the member bank's most recent Call Report. The Reserve Banks are developing software that will automatically pull the information needed to calculate member banks' required stock subscriptions from Call Reports and thereby automate the stock adjustment process. More specifically, the Board proposes that a Reserve Bank would adjust a member bank's stock subscription each time the member bank files a Call Report.The Board is also proposing to make explicit the existing Reserve Bank practice of requiring a surviving member bank apply to adjust its stock subscription before merging or consolidating with another bank. Finally, the Board is proposing two technical amendments to Regulation I and conforming revisions to the FR 2056 reporting form. First, the proposed rule would specify which Reserve Banks are responsible for receiving membership applications from banks located in U.S. territories and dependencies. Second, the proposed rule would state explicitly that a national bank that wants to convert into a state nonmember bank must promptly file with its Reserve Bank an application for cancellation of all its Reserve Bank stock.The Board's notice is attached.

200,7/15/2020,"The Federal Reserve Board on Wednesday announced an extension of a rule change to bolster the effectiveness of the Small Business Administration's (SBA) Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). Like the earlier rule, the extension will temporarily modify the Board's rules so that certain bank directors and shareholders can apply to their banks for PPP loans for their small businesses.To prevent favoritism, the Board limits the types and quantity of loans that bank directors, shareholders, officers, and businesses owned by these persons can receive from their affiliated banks. However, these limits have prevented some small business owners from accessing PPP loans—especially in rural areas.The SBA clarified in April that PPP lenders can make PPP loans to businesses owned by their directors and certain shareholders, subject to certain limits, and without favoritism. The Board's rule change will allow those individuals to apply for PPP loans, consistent with SBA's rules and restrictions. The change only applies to PPP loans.The Board is providing the temporary change to allow banks to continue to make PPP loans to a broad range of small businesses within their communities. The SBA explicitly has prohibited banks from favoring in processing time or prioritization a PPP loan application from a director or equity holder, and the Board will administer its rule change accordingly.The rule change is effective immediately and will be in place while the PPP is active.

212,6/25/2020,"The Federal Reserve Board on Thursday released the results of its stress tests for 2020 and additional sensitivity analyses that the Board conducted in light of the coronavirus event.""The banking system has been a source of strength during this crisis,"" Vice Chair Randal K. Quarles said, ""and the results of our sensitivity analyses show that our banks can remain strong in the face of even the harshest shocks.""In addition to its normal stress test, the Board conducted a sensitivity analysis to assess the resiliency of large banks under three hypothetical recessions, or downside scenarios, which could result from the coronavirus event. The scenarios included a V-shaped recession and recovery; a slower, U-shaped recession and recovery; and a W-shaped, double-dip recession.In the three downside scenarios, the unemployment rate peaked at between 15.6 percent and 19.5 percent, which is significantly more stringent than any of the Board's pre-coronavirus stress test scenarios. The scenarios are not predictions or forecasts of the likely path of the economy or financial markets.In aggregate, loan losses for the 34 banks ranged from $560 billion to $700 billion in the sensitivity analysis and aggregate capital ratios declined from 12.0 percent in the fourth quarter of 2019 to between 9.5 percent and 7.7 percent under the hypothetical downside scenarios. Under the U- and W-shaped scenarios, most firms remain well capitalized but several would approach minimum capital levels. The sensitivity analysis does not incorporate the potential effects of government stimulus payments and expanded unemployment insurance.In light of these results, the Board took several actions following its stress tests to ensure large banks remain resilient despite the economic uncertainty from the coronavirus event. For the third quarter of this year, the Board is requiring large banks to preserve capital by suspending share repurchases, capping dividend payments, and allowing dividends according to a formula based on recent income. The Board is also requiring banks to re-evaluate their longer-term capital plans.All large banks will be required to resubmit and update their capital plans later this year to reflect current stresses, which will help firms re-assess their capital needs and maintain strong capital planning practices during this period of uncertainty. The Board will conduct additional analysis each quarter to determine if adjustments to this response are appropriate.During the third quarter, no share repurchases will be permitted. In recent years, share repurchases have represented approximately 70 percent of shareholder payouts from large banks. The Board is also capping dividend payments to the amount paid in the second quarter and is further limiting them to an amount based on recent earnings. As a result, a bank cannot increase its dividend and can pay dividends if it has earned sufficient income.The Board also released the results of its full stress test designed before the coronavirus. The results from that test are comparable to the V-shaped downside scenario in the sensitivity analysis, in aggregate, and show that all large banks remain strongly capitalized. The Board will use the results of this test to set the new stress capital buffer requirement for these firms, which will take effect, as planned, in the fourth quarter. Additionally, the Board will not be objecting to five foreign banks whose capital planning practices were evaluated as part of the stress tests.For media inquiries, call 202-452-2955.Dodd-Frank Act Stress Test 2020: Supervisory Stress Test Results (PDF)*Assessment of Bank Capital during the Recent Coronavirus Event (PDF)*Statement by Vice Chair for Supervision QuarlesStatement by Governor Brainard*This document was corrected on September 4, 2020, due to an error identified by the Board.

213,6/25/2020,"Five federal agencies have finalized changes to their swap margin rule to facilitate the implementation of prudent risk management strategies at banks and other entities with significant swap activities.Under the final rule, entities that are part of the same banking organization generally will no longer be required to hold a specific amount of initial margin for uncleared swaps with each other, known as inter-affiliate swaps. Inter-affiliate swaps typically are used for internal risk management purposes by transferring risk to a centralized risk management function within the firm. The final rule will give firms additional flexibility to allocate collateral internally and support prudent risk management and safety and soundness.Inter-affiliate swaps will remain subject to variation margin requirements, and initial margin will still be required if a depository institution's total exposure to all affiliates exceeds 15 percent of its Tier 1 capital.To help transition from LIBOR to alternative reference rates, the final rule allows swap entities to amend legacy swaps to replace the reference to LIBOR or other reference rates that are expected to end without triggering margin exchange requirements. The final rule also clarifies that swap entities may conduct risk-reducing portfolio compression or make certain other non-substantive amendments to their legacy swap portfolios without altering their legacy status.For smaller swap market participants, the agencies are finalizing as proposed the additional phased compliance period for the smallest covered swap entities and financial end-user counterparties.Simultaneously, the agencies are requesting comment on an interim final rule that extends the compliance date of the initial margin requirements of the swap margin rules to September 1, 2021, for swap entities and counterparties with average annual notional swap portfolios of $50 billion to $750 billion. This interim final rule also extends the initial margin compliance date to September 1, 2022, for counterparties with average annual notional swap portfolios of $8 billion to $50 billion.

217,6/18/2020,"The Federal Reserve today published the FraudClassifier model—a set of tools and materials to help provide a consistent way to classify and better understand the magnitude of fraudulent activity and how it occurs across the payments industry. The model was developed by the Fraud Definitions Work Group, which was comprised of Federal Reserve and payments industry fraud experts.""The FraudClassifier model can help address the industrywide challenge of inconsistent classifications for fraud involving ACH, wire, or check payments,"" said Jim Cunha, secure payments strategy leader and senior vice president at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. ""The FraudClassifier model enables payments stakeholders to classify fraud in a simple and similar manner. It can be applied across an organization to help ensure greater internal consistency in fraud classification, more robust information and better fraud tracking.""The key advantage of the FraudClassifier model is the ability for organizations to use it to classify fraud independently of payment type, payment channel or other payment characteristics. The model presents a series of questions, beginning with who initiated the payment to differentiate payments initiated by authorized or unauthorized parties. Each of the classifications is supported by definitions that allow for consistent application of the FraudClassifier model across the industry.The Fraud Definitions Work Group also developed and recommended an industry adoption roadmap, which outlines a strategy and potential steps to encourage voluntary industrywide use of the FraudClassifier model.Learn more—and sign up to access educational resources and support tools for the FraudClassifier model—by visiting FedPaymentsImprovement.org.About the Federal Reserve and Payments

220,11/19/2019,"Three federal bank regulatory agencies on Tuesday jointly announced a final rule updating how certain banking organizations are required to measure counterparty credit risk for derivative contracts under their regulatory capital rules.The final rule implements the ""standardized approach for measuring counterparty credit risk,"" also known as SA-CCR. This updated methodology better reflects improvements made to the derivatives market since the 2007-2008 financial crisis such as central clearing and margin requirements. SA-CCR would replace the ""current exposure methodology"" for large, internationally active banking organizations, while other, smaller banking organizations could voluntarily adopt SA-CCR.While generally consistent with the proposal released for comment in October 2018, the final rule has been revised in response to comments from the public. Those changes include revised capital requirements for derivatives contracts with commercial end-user counterparties.The agencies estimate that the final rule will not materially change the current amount of capital in the banking system, though the effect on individual banking organizations will vary depending on their portfolios.The Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency jointly issued the final rule. It will be effective on April 1, 2020, with a mandatory compliance date of January 1, 2022."

The final rule also clarifies the treatment of credit facilities that finance one- to four-family residential properties and the development of land, which is substantially similar to the proposal issued in July.Additionally, in response to the comments, the final rule provides banking organizations with the option to maintain their current capital treatment for acquisition, development, or construction loans originated between January 1, 2015, and the effective date of the final rule, April 1, 2020.Federal Register notice HTML"
222,11/19/2019,"The federal bank regulatory agencies have finalized changes to a capital requirement for banking organizations predominantly engaged in custodial activities, as required by the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (EGRRCPA). The final rule is unchanged from the proposal issued for public comment in April 2019.The EGRRCPA requires the agencies to permit certain banking organizations—those predominantly engaged in custody, safekeeping, and asset servicing activities—to exclude qualifying deposits at certain central banks from their supplementary leverage ratio. The supplementary leverage ratio is one of many tools used by the federal bank regulatory agencies to determine minimum required capital levels and ensure financial stability in the event of stress in the banking system. It applies only to large or complex internationally active banking organizations.Based on current data, only The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation, Northern Trust Corporation, and State Street Corporation, together with their depository institution subsidiaries, would qualify for the rule.The final rule will be effective April 1, 2020."

225,11/8/2019,"The Federal Reserve Board on Friday invited public comment on a proposal to extend by 18 months the initial compliance dates for foreign banks subject to its single-counterparty credit limit rule. The extension would provide additional time for foreign jurisdictions' versions of the rule to become effective and would apply only to the combined U.S. operations of the foreign banks and not to any U.S. intermediate holding companies of those banks.In June 2018, the Board finalized a rule to enhance financial stability by limiting the exposure that a large domestic or foreign bank can have to another counterparty. The rule applied those limits to both the intermediate holding company and combined U.S. operations of foreign banks. For the limits applied to combined U.S. operations, the Board's rule allows a foreign bank to comply by certifying that it meets a similar rule or standard of its home country.To date, certain foreign jurisdictions are in the process of finalizing their rules or standards. The extension would allow additional time for foreign banks to comply with the Board's rule via certification with a similar home country rule or standard. All other parts of the Board's rule remain unchanged.Under the proposal, the largest foreign banks need to comply by July 1, 2021, while smaller foreign banks would need to comply by January 1, 2022.

227,10/31/2019,"The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) and Federal Reserve Board today announced the dollar thresholds in Regulation Z (Truth in Lending) and Regulation M (Consumer Leasing) that will apply for determining exempt consumer credit and lease transactions in 2020. These thresholds are set pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) amendments to the Truth in Lending Act and the Consumer Leasing Act that require adjusting these thresholds annually based on the annual percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). If there is no annual percentage increase in the CPI-W, the Federal Reserve Board and the Bureau will not adjust this exemption threshold from the prior year. However, in years following a year in which the exemption threshold was not adjusted, the threshold is calculated by applying the annual percentage change in CPI-W to the dollar amount that would have resulted, after rounding, if the decreases and any subsequent increases in the CPI-W had been taken into account. Transactions at or below the thresholds are subject to the protections of the regulations.Based on the annual percentage increase in the CPI-W as of June 1, 2019, the protections of the Truth in Lending Act and the Consumer Leasing Act generally will apply to consumer credit transactions and consumer leases of $58,300 or less in 2020. However, private education loans and loans secured by real property (such as mortgages) are subject to the Truth in Lending Act regardless of the amount of the loan.Although the Dodd-Frank Act generally transferred rulemaking authority under the Truth in Lending Act and the Consumer Leasing Act to the Bureau, the Federal Reserve Board retains authority to issue rules for certain motor vehicle dealers. Therefore, the agencies are issuing these notices jointly.The attached notices will be published shortly in the Federal Register.Federal Register notice HTML: Regulation MFederal Register notice HTML: Regulation Z"
228,10/31/2019,"The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Federal Reserve Board, and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency today announced that the threshold for exempting loans from special appraisal requirements for higher-priced mortgage loans during 2020 will increase from $26,700 to $27,200.The threshold amount will be effective January 1, 2020, and is based on the annual percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) as of June 1, 2019.The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 amended the Truth in Lending Act to add special appraisal requirements for higher-priced mortgage loans, including a requirement that creditors obtain a written appraisal based on a physical visit to the home's interior before making a higher-priced mortgage loan. The rules implementing these requirements contain an exemption for loans of $25,000 or less and also provide that the exemption threshold will be adjusted annually to reflect increases in the CPI-W. If there is no annual percentage increase in the CPI-W, the agencies will not adjust this exemption threshold from the prior year. However, in years following a year in which the exemption threshold was not adjusted, the threshold is calculated by applying the annual percentage change in CPI-W to the dollar amount that would have resulted, after rounding, if the decreases and any subsequent increases in the CPI-W had been taken into account.The attached notice will be published shortly in the Federal Register.Federal Register notice HTML"
229,10/30/2019,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in September indicates that the labor market remains strong and that economic activity has been rising at a moderate rate. Job gains have been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low. Although household spending has been rising at a strong pace, business fixed investment and exports remain weak. On a 12-month basis, overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy are running below 2 percent. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed.Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. In light of the implications of global developments for the economic outlook as well as muted inflation pressures, the Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate to 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 percent. This action supports the Committee's view that sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective are the most likely outcomes, but uncertainties about this outlook remain. The Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook as it assesses the appropriate path of the target range for the federal funds rate.In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.Voting for the monetary policy action were Jerome H. Powell, Chair; John C. Williams, Vice Chair; Michelle W. Bowman; Lael Brainard; James Bullard; Richard H. Clarida; Charles L. Evans; and Randal K. Quarles. Voting against this action were: Esther L. George and Eric S. Rosengren, who preferred at this meeting to maintain the target range at 1-3/4 percent to 2 percent.Implementation Note issued October 30, 2019"
230,10/29/2019,"Federal bank regulatory agencies finalized a rule that simplifies capital requirements for community banks by allowing them to adopt a simple leverage ratio to measure capital adequacy. The community bank leverage ratio framework removes requirements for calculating and reporting risk-based capital ratios for a qualifying community bank that opts into the framework.To qualify for the framework, a community bank must have less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets, limited amounts of off-balance-sheet exposures and trading assets and liabilities, and a leverage ratio greater than 9 percent.In response to public comments and outreach, the final rule was modified from the November 2018 proposal to reduce compliance burden while maintaining safety and soundness for qualifying community banks. In particular, the community bank leverage ratio incorporates tier 1 capital as the numerator. In addition, a community bank that falls out of compliance with the framework will have a two-quarter grace period to come back into full compliance, provided its leverage ratio remains above 8 percent. A bank will be deemed well-capitalized during the grace period.The agencies estimate approximately 85 percent of community banks will qualify for the community bank leverage ratio framework. The final rule is consistent with the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act.The community bank leverage ratio framework will first be available for banking organizations to use in their March 31, 2020, Call Report or Form FR Y-9C, as applicable. Banking organizations can opt into or out of the community bank leverage ratio framework in a subsequent Call Report or Form FR Y-9C, as applicable. The agencies have prepared a compliance guide to accompany the rule.In addition, the agencies finalized a rule to allow non-advanced approaches banks, including community banks, to elect to adopt simplifying changes to the capital rule beginning on January 1, 2020, a quarter earlier than the mandatory compliance date of April 1, 2020. The agencies issued the simplifying changes in July 2019.Federal Register notice 1 HTMLFederal Register notice 2 HTMLCommunity Bank Leverage Ratio Framework: Community Bank Compliance Guide (PDF)"
231,10/28/2019,"The Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation on Monday announced that they had finalized a rule that modifies their resolution plan requirements for large firms. The rule retains resolution plan elements in place for the largest firms, while reducing requirements for smaller firms that pose less risk to the financial system.Resolution plans, also known as living wills, describe a firm's strategy for orderly resolution under bankruptcy in the event of material financial distress or failure of the firm. Since the resolution planning requirements took effect in 2012, the largest firms have improved their resolution strategies and governance, refined their estimates of liquidity and capital needs in resolution, and simplified their legal structures. These changes have made the firms substantially more resilient.The final rule is substantially the same as the proposal from earlier this year. It uses a separate framework developed by the banking agencies for application of prudential requirements, and establishes resolution planning requirements tailored to the level of risk a firm poses to the financial system. The final rule is consistent with the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act and would affect domestic and foreign firms with more than $100 billion in total consolidated assets.For the most systemically important firms, the final rule would adopt the current practice of requiring resolution plans to be submitted on a two-year cycle. The final rule would tailor the rule's requirements for firms that do not pose the same systemic risk as the largest institutions, requiring resolution plans to be submitted on a three-year cycle. Both groups of firms would alternate between submitting full resolution plans and targeted resolution plans. Foreign firms with relatively limited U.S. operations would be required to submit reduced resolution plans.A targeted resolution plan would include core elements related to capital, liquidity, and plans for recapitalization, as well as material changes to the firm and areas of interest identified by the agencies. Targeted resolution plans would not include certain areas if they are materially unchanged from one cycle to another, such as descriptions of management information systems and corporate governance systems. As a result, targeted resolution plans would give the agencies meaningful insight into the key vulnerabilities in a firm's resolution strategy.Firms with less than $250 billion in total consolidated assets that do not meet certain risk criteria would no longer be subject to the rule. These firms have simpler structures, engage more exclusively in traditional banking activity, and present less risk. These changes do not affect the resolution planning requirements under the FDIC's insured depository institution rule for large insured depository institutions, which is part of a separate rulemaking.In a change from the proposal, only smaller and less complex firms could request changes to their full resolution plans and both agencies would need to approve those requests for them to become effective.The attached charts show the new requirements and a list of firms that are expected to be in each category. The rule will be effective 60 days after publication in the Federal Register.Board Memo (PDF)Federal Register noticeVisual (PDF)Opening Statement by Chair Jerome H.

232,10/28/2019,"Five federal agencies today announced a proposal to change the swap margin rules to facilitate the implementation of prudent risk management strategies at certain banks and swap entities.The swap margin rule would no longer require swap entities to hold initial margin for uncleared swaps with affiliates. However, inter-affiliate transactions would still be subject to variation margin requirements. Swap entities regulated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Federal Reserve Board also would be subject to requirements under sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act. The Federal Reserve Board continues to work on proposed amendments to Regulation W that would, among other things, clarify the treatment of bank-affiliate derivatives under sections 23A and 23B.Inter-affiliate swaps typically are used for internal risk management purposes, by transferring risk to a centralized risk management function within the firm. The proposal would give firms additional flexibility to allocate collateral internally, supporting prudent risk management strategies that support safety and soundness. The proposal would not change the capital standards for swap entities supervised by the five agencies.Furthermore, to aid in the transition away from LIBOR, the agencies proposed to allow certain technical amendments to legacy swaps without altering their status under the swap margin rules.For smaller counterparties, the proposal would provide clarification on documentation requirements and implementation relief. In addition, the proposal would extend the effective date by one year to September 1, 2021, for smaller counterparties to meet initial margin requirements.Comments on the proposal will be accepted for 30 days following publication in the Federal Register.Statement by Governor Lael Brainard"

CECL is effective for most public financial institutions beginning in 2020, and the FASB recently decided to defer the effective date of CECL for all other institutions to 2023. The proposed interagency policy statement would be effective at the time of each institution's adoption of the credit losses accounting standard.The agencies also are requesting comment on the proposed Interagency Guidance on Credit Risk Review Systems. The guidance presents principles for establishing a system of independent, ongoing credit risk review in accordance with safety and soundness standards.The proposals were issued by the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the National Credit Union Administration, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.

241,1/25/2019,"Federal banking agencies find that risk in the portfolio of large syndicated bank loans has declined, due to improving conditions in most sectors. Despite the improvement, the dollar volume of loans rated below ""pass,"" as a percentage of total loans, remains elevated compared with levels experienced in prior economic cycles, according to the Shared National Credit (SNC) Program Review.The report--released today by the Federal Reserve Board (Federal Reserve), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC)--reflects the results of reviews in 2018 covering SNC loans originated by or before March 31, 2018. Furthermore, the review finds increased risks associated with leveraged lending. The agencies remind banks to update credit risk management practices as the risk profile of borrowers and the industry changes.The 2018 SNC portfolio included 8,571 credit facilities to 5,314 borrowers, totaling $4.4 trillion, up from $4.3 trillion in 2017. U.S. banks held the greatest volume of SNC commitments at 44.3 percent of the portfolio, followed by foreign banking organizations and other investor entities such as securitization pools, hedge funds, insurance companies, and pension funds. Effective January 1, 2018, the agencies increased the minimum aggregate loan commitment threshold to be included in the review from $20 million to $100 million. Under the revised definition, loan commitments increased modestly compared with levels reported in 2017. The number of borrowers and credit facilities, however, has declined.Reviewed loan commitments were stratified by the severity of their risk--special mention, substandard, doubtful, or loss, the last three of which are known as ""classified."" Overall, the level of loans rated below ""pass,"" as a percentage of the total SNC portfolio, decreased year-over-year from 9.7 percent to 6.7 percent. Leveraged lending was the primary contributor to the overall ""special mention"" and ""classified"" rates, comprising 73 percent of ""special mention"" and 86 percent of ""classified"" commitments. Investors outside the banking industry held the greatest volume of ""special mention"" and ""classified"" commitments, followed by U.S. banks and foreign banking organizations.The agencies conduct SNC reviews in the first and third calendar quarters with some banks receiving two reviews and others receiving a single review each year. The agencies issue a single statement annually that includes combined findings from the previous 12 months. This practice presents a complete view of the entire SNC portfolio, which can be compared with prior years' reports. The next report will be published following the third quarter 2019 SNC examination.For additional information, see the attached SNC Program Review Report."

244,1/18/2019,"The publication on Friday of the Federal Reserve Board's monthly statistical release on industrial production and capacity utilization marks the 100th anniversary of Board data on industrial production. The index has kept pace with an ever-evolving industrial sector by providing information that spans from the rise of the modern factory through the digital age.The Board began collecting information about industrial production to satisfy the Federal Reserve's need for timely and relevant data on the U.S. economy. The Board's measure of industrial production remains an important economic indicator today and is frequently used by academics, businesses, and policymakers.The index originally divided output into 55 categories and now includes 300, reflecting an increased ability to track the diversity and changing composition of the industrial sector. For example, in 1919, textile manufacturing represented nearly a quarter of the index. Almost the same proportion is represented in 2019 by the combination of motor vehicles and parts, aircraft, and oil and gas extraction. Textiles now represent less than 1 percent of the index. A short history of the index that describes its introduction and tracks its changes and improvements over the past century is available on the Board's website.For media inquiries, call 202-452-2955."

As they have in prior shutdowns, the agencies encourage financial institutions to consider prudent efforts to modify terms on existing loans or extend new credit to help affected borrowers.Prudent workout arrangements that are consistent with safe-and-sound lending practices are generally in the long-term best interest of the financial institution, the borrower, and the economy.

250,1/10/2019,"The Federal Reserve Board on Thursday announced preliminary results indicating that the Reserve Banks provided for payments of approximately $65.4 billion of their estimated 2018 net income to the U.S. Treasury. The payments include two lump-sum payments totaling approximately $3.2 billion, necessary to reduce aggregate Reserve Bank capital surplus to $6.825 billion as required by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (Budget Act) and the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (Economic Growth Act). The 2018 audited Reserve Bank financial statements are expected to be published in March and may include adjustments to these preliminary unaudited results.The Federal Reserve Banks' 2018 estimated net income of $63.1 billion represents a decrease of $17.6 billion from 2017, primarily attributable to an increase of $12.6 billion in interest expense associated with reserve balances held by depository institutions. Net income for 2018 was derived primarily from $112.3 billion in interest income on securities acquired through open market operations--U.S. Treasury securities, federal agency and government-sponsored enterprise (GSE) mortgage-backed securities, and GSE debt securities. The Federal Reserve Banks had interest expense of $38.5 billion primarily associated with reserve balances held by depository institutions, and incurred interest expense of $4.6 billion on securities sold under agreement to repurchase.Operating expenses of the Reserve Banks, net of amounts reimbursed by the U.S. Treasury and other entities for services the Reserve Banks provided as fiscal agents, totaled $4.3 billion in 2018.In addition, the Reserve Banks were assessed $849 million for the costs related to producing, issuing, and retiring currency, $838 million for Board expenditures, and $337 million to fund the operations of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Additional earnings were derived from income from services of $444 million.

Additionally, in place of the current annual cycle, the proposal would generally require firms above the threshold to conduct company-run stress tests once every other year.The proposal also would eliminate the hypothetical ""adverse"" scenario from company-run stress tests for bank holding companies, state member banks, U.S. intermediate holding companies of foreign banking organizations, and any nonbank financial company supervised by the Board. Similarly, the Board would no longer include an ""adverse"" scenario in its supervisory stress tests. The firms would still be required to test themselves against a more severe hypothetical scenario, known as the ""severely adverse"" scenario, and the supervisory stress tests also would continue to include a ""severely adverse"" scenario.The proposal is similar to separate proposals issued by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.

266,5/2/2018,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in March indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising at a moderate rate. Job gains have been strong, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has stayed low. Recent data suggest that growth of household spending moderated from its strong fourth-quarter pace, while business fixed investment continued to grow strongly. On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy have moved close to 2 percent. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance.Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee expects that, with further gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace in the medium term and labor market conditions will remain strong. Inflation on a 12-month basis is expected to run near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term. Risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced.In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 percent. The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting strong labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation.In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. The Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to its symmetric inflation goal. The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant further gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run. However, the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data.Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were Jerome H.

278,4/11/2018,"The Federal Reserve Board and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) on Wednesday proposed a rule that would further tailor leverage ratio requirements to the business activities and risk profiles of the largest domestic firms.Currently, firms that are required to comply with the ""enhanced supplementary leverage ratio"" are subject to a fixed leverage standard, regardless of their systemic footprint. The proposal would instead tie the standard to the risk-based capital surcharge of the firm, which is based on the firm's individual characteristics. The resulting leverage standard would be more closely tailored to each firm.The proposed changes seek to retain a meaningful calibration of the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio standards while not discouraging firms from participating in low-risk activities. The changes also correspond to recent changes proposed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. Taking into account supervisory stress testing and existing capital requirements, agency staff estimate that the proposed changes would reduce the required amount of tier 1 capital for the holding companies of these firms by approximately $400 million, or approximately 0.04 percent in aggregate tier 1 capital.Enhanced supplementary leverage ratio standards apply to all U.S. holding companies identified as global systemically important banking organizations (GSIBs), as well as the insured depository institution subsidiaries of those firms.Currently, GSIBs must maintain a supplementary leverage ratio of more than 5 percent, which is the sum of the minimum 3 percent requirement plus a buffer of 2 percent, to avoid limitations on capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments. The insured depository institution subsidiaries of the GSIBs must maintain a supplementary leverage ratio of 6 percent to be considered ""well capitalized"" under the agencies' prompt corrective action framework.At the holding company level, the proposed rule would modify the fixed 2 percent buffer to be set to one half of each firm's risk-based capital surcharge. For example, if a GSIB's risk-based capital surcharge is 2 percent, it would now be required to maintain a supplementary leverage ratio of more than 4 percent, which is the sum of the unchanged minimum 3 percent requirement plus a modified buffer of 1 percent.

281,9/6/2017,"The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and state bank regulators recognize the serious impact of Hurricane Irma on the customers and operations of many financial institutions and will provide regulatory assistance to affected institutions subject to their supervision. The agencies encourage institutions in the affected areas to meet the financial services needs of their communities.A complete list of the affected disaster areas can be found at www.fema.gov.Lending: Bankers should work constructively with borrowers in communities affected by Hurricane Irma. The agencies realize that the effects of natural disasters on local businesses and individuals are often transitory, and prudent efforts to adjust or alter terms on existing loans in affected areas should not be subject to examiner criticism. In supervising institutions affected by the hurricane, the agencies will consider the unusual circumstances they face. The agencies recognize that efforts to work with borrowers in communities under stress can be consistent with safe-and-sound banking practices as well as in the public interest.Community Reinvestment Act (CRA): Financial institutions may receive CRA consideration for community development loans, investments, or services that revitalize or stabilize federally designated disaster areas in their assessment areas or in the states or regions that include their assessment areas. For additional information, institutions should review the Interagency Questions and Answers Regarding Community Reinvestment at https://www.ffiec.gov/cra/qnadoc.htm.Investments: Bankers should monitor municipal securities and loans affected by the hurricane. The agencies realize local government projects may be negatively affected. Appropriate monitoring and prudent efforts to stabilize such investments are encouraged.Regulatory Reporting Requirements: Institutions affected by Hurricane Irma that expect to encounter difficulty meeting the agencies' reporting requirements should contact their primary federal regulatory agency to discuss their situation. The agencies do not expect to assess penalties or take other supervisory action against institutions that take reasonable and prudent steps to comply with the agencies' regulatory reporting requirements if those institutions are unable to fully satisfy those requirements because of the effects of Hurricane Irma. The agencies' staffs stand ready to work with affected institutions that may be experiencing problems fulfilling their reporting responsibilities, taking into account each institution's particular circumstances, including the status of its reporting and recordkeeping systems and the condition of its underlying financial records.Publishing Requirements: The agencies understand that the damage caused by the hurricane may affect compliance with publishing and other requirements for branch closings, relocations, and temporary facilities under various laws and regulations. Institutions experiencing disaster-related difficulties in complying with any publishing or other requirements should contact their primary federal and state regulatory agency.Temporary Banking Facilities: The agencies understand that many banks face power, telecommunications, staffing and other challenges in re-opening facilities after the hurricane. In cases in which operational challenges persist, the appropriate primary federal and state regulator will expedite any request to operate temporary banking facilities to provide more convenient availability of services to those affected by the hurricane. In most cases, a telephone notice to the primary federal and state regulator will suffice initially. Necessary written notification can be submitted later."

285,9/1/2017,"The Federal Reserve Board on Friday adopted a final rule to enhance financial stability by requiring U.S. global systemically important banking institutions (GSIBs) and the U.S. operations of foreign GSIBs to amend qualified financial contracts to prevent their immediate cancellation or termination if the firm enters bankruptcy or a resolution process.Qualified financial contracts (QFCs) include derivatives, securities lending, and short-term funding transactions such as repurchase agreements. Given the large volume of QFCs to which GSIBs are a party, the mass termination of QFCs in the event of financial distress or failure of a GSIB may lead to the disorderly failure of the firm, spark asset fire sales, and transmit financial distress across the U.S. financial system. The final rule contains two key requirements. First, the final rule requires QFCs of GSIBs, including those with foreign counterparties, to clarify that U.S. resolution laws providing for a temporary stay to prevent mass terminations apply to the contracts. Second, the final rule prohibits the QFCs of GSIBs from allowing the exercise of default rights that could spread the bankruptcy of one GSIB entity to its solvent affiliates.""The final rule will reduce the threat that a disorderly unraveling of QFCs would pose to our financial system and the broader economy,"" said Governor Jerome H. Powell.""GSIBs may comply with the final rule by using the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) 2015 Universal Resolution Stay Protocol or a similar resolution stay protocol described in the final regulation to amend their QFCs.In response to comments, the Board tailored the transition period based on the type of counterparty. The final rule requires GSIBs to conform their QFCs with other GSIBs within one year and within 18 months for QFCs with most other financial counterparties. Additionally, GSIBs would have two years to conform QFCs with community banks and all other counterparties. The final rule also excludes QFCs that do not contain default rights or restrictions that could undermine the orderly resolution of a GSIB.Compliance will phase in beginning on January 1, 2019.For media inquiries, call 202-452-2955.Restrictions on Qualified Financial Contracts of Systemically Important U.S. Banking Organizations and the U.S. Operations of Systemically Important Foreign Banking Organizations; Revisions to the Definition of Qualifying Master Netting Agreement and Related Definitions: HTML | PDFOpening Statement by Chair Janet l.

SOFR would include tri-party repo data from Bank of New York Mellon (BNYM) and cleared bilateral and GCF Repo data from the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC).""SOFR will be derived from the deepest, most resilient funding market in the United States. As such, it represents a robust rate that will support U.S. financial stability,"" said Federal Reserve Board Governor Jerome H.

Because these rates are based on transactions secured by U.S. Treasury securities, they are essentially risk-free, providing a valuable benchmark for market participants to use in financial transactions.Comments on the proposal to produce the three rates are requested within 60 days of publication in the Federal Register, which is expected shortly.For media inquiries, call 202-452-2955.Federal Register notice: HTML | PDF"

294,8/22/2017,"In preparation for a forthcoming proposal that would simplify regulatory capital requirements, federal banking regulators on Tuesday proposed a rule that would extend the existing transitional capital treatment for certain regulatory capital deductions and risk weights. The extension would apply to banking organizations that are not subject to the agencies' advanced approaches capital rules.As part of the recent review of regulations under the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act, the agencies announced that they are developing a proposal that would simplify the capital rules to reduce regulatory burden, particularly for community banks. That proposal would simplify the capital rules' treatment of mortgage servicing assets and other items. However, under the current capital rules, the transitional treatment for those items is scheduled to be replaced with a different treatment on January 1, 2018.As a result, the agencies are proposing to extend the existing transition provisions for a targeted set of items: mortgage servicing assets, certain deferred tax assets, investments in the capital instruments of unconsolidated financial institutions, and minority interests. This proposal would prevent the implementation of the fully phased-in requirements for these items by banking organizations that are not subject to the advanced approaches capital rules prior to the agencies' consideration of simplification to the capital rules.Banking organizations that are not subject to the advanced approaches capital rules are generally those with less than $250 billion in total consolidated assets and less than $10 billion in total foreign exposure. Firms that are subject to the advanced approaches rules would not be affected by this proposal and would remain subject to the fully phased-in requirements for these exposures beginning on January 1, 2018.Comments on this proposal will be accepted for 30 days after publication in the Federal Register.

300,12/15/2016,"The Federal Reserve Board on Thursday adopted a final rule to strengthen the ability of government authorities to resolve in an orderly way the largest domestic and foreign banks operating in the United States without any support from taxpayer-provided capital.These institutions will be required to meet a new long-term debt requirement and a new ""total loss-absorbing capacity,"" or TLAC, requirement. The final rule applies to domestic firms identified by the Board as global systemically important banks (GSIBs) and to the U.S. operations of foreign GSIBs.To reduce the systemic impact of the failure of a GSIB, a bankruptcy or statutory orderly resolution process imposes the losses of a failed GSIB on investors rather than taxpayers as the critical operations of the firm continue to function. Requiring a GSIB to maintain sufficient amounts of long-term debt, which can be converted to equity during resolution, would help achieve this objective by providing a source of private capital to support the firm's critical operations during resolution.""The rule is guided by common sense principles: bank shareholders and debt investors should place their own money at risk so depositors and taxpayers are well protected, and the biggest banks must bear the costs that come with their size,"" Chair Janet L. Yellen said.Like the proposal issued in October 2015, the final rule will set a minimum level of long-term debt for domestic GSIBs and the U.S. operations of foreign GSIBs that could be used to recapitalize the critical operations of the firms upon failure. The complementary TLAC requirement will set a new minimum level of total loss-absorbing capacity, which can be met with both regulatory capital and long-term debt. These requirements will improve the prospects for the orderly resolution of a failed GSIB and will strengthen the resiliency of all GSIBs.""While equity is far and away the best form of capital to ensure the resilience of a firm, the whole point of resolution planning is to prepare for the eventuality, no matter how unlikely, that the firm might become insolvent in some circumstances,"" Governor Daniel K. Tarullo said. ""By definition, at that point equity capital will either be totally lost, or at least below the level markets have historically required for a financial intermediary to be credible. The long-term debt required by this proposal would survive the disappearance of a bank's equity and resultant failure, and would be available for conversion into new equity.""The final rule also will require the parent holding company of a domestic GSIB to avoid entering into certain financial arrangements that would create obstacles to an orderly resolution. These ""clean holding company"" requirements will include bans on issuance of short-term debt to external investors and on entering into derivatives and certain other types of financial contracts with external counterparties.In response to comments received on the proposed rule, the Board made several notable changes:All firms will be required to comply with the rule by January 1, 2019.For media inquiries, call 202-452-2955.Opening Statement by Chair Janet L.

302,12/14/2016,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in November indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace since mid-year. Job gains have been solid in recent months and the unemployment rate has declined. Household spending has been rising moderately but business fixed investment has remained soft. Inflation has increased since earlier this year but is still below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports. Market-based measures of inflation compensation have moved up considerably but still are low; most survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance, in recent months.Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat further. Inflation is expected to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of past declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further. Near-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced. The Committee continues to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments.In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 1/2 to 3/4 percent. The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting some further strengthening in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation.In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. In light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, the Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal. The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run. However, the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data.The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction, and it anticipates doing so until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under way. This policy, by keeping the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions.Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Janet L.

303,12/13/2016,"The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Federal Reserve Board on Tuesday announced that Bank of America, Bank of New York Mellon, JP Morgan Chase, and State Street adequately remediated deficiencies in their 2015 resolution plans. The agencies also announced that Wells Fargo did not adequately remedy all of its deficiencies and will be subject to restrictions on certain activities until the deficiencies are remedied.Resolution plans, required by the Dodd-Frank Act and commonly known as living wills, must describe the company's strategy for rapid and orderly resolution under bankruptcy in the event of material financial distress or failure of the company.In April 2016, the agencies jointly determined that each of the 2015 resolution plans of the five institutions was not credible or would not facilitate an orderly resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the statutory standard established in the Dodd-Frank Act. The agencies issued joint notices of deficiencies to the five firms detailing the deficiencies in their plans and the actions the firms must take to address them. Each firm was required to remedy its deficiencies by October 1, 2016, or risk being subject to more stringent prudential requirements or to restrictions on activities, growth, or operations. The review and the findings announced today relate only to the joint deficiencies identified in April 2016.The agencies jointly determined that Wells Fargo did not adequately remedy two of the firm's three deficiencies, specifically in the categories of ""legal entity rationalization"" and ""shared services."" The agencies also jointly determined that the firm did adequately remedy its deficiency in the ""governance"" category. In light of the nature of the deficiencies and the resolvability risks posed by Wells Fargo's failure to remedy them, the agencies have jointly determined to impose restrictions on the growth of international and non-bank activities of Wells Fargo and its subsidiaries. In particular, Wells Fargo is prohibited from establishing international bank entities or acquiring any non-bank subsidiary.The firm is expected to file a revised submission addressing the remaining deficiencies by March 31, 2017. If after reviewing the March submission the agencies jointly determine that the deficiencies have not been adequately remedied, the agencies will limit the size of the firm's non-bank and broker-dealer assets to levels in place on September 30, 2016. If Wells Fargo has not adequately remedied the deficiencies within two years, the statute provides that the agencies, in consultation with the Financial Stability Oversight Council, may jointly require the firm to divest certain assets or operations to facilitate an orderly resolution of the firm in bankruptcy.The Federal Reserve Board is releasing the feedback letters issued to each of the five firms. The letters describe the steps the firms have taken to address the deficiencies outlined in the April 2016 letters. The feedback letter issued to Wells Fargo discusses the steps the firm has taken to address its deficiencies and those needed to adequately remedy the two remaining deficiencies.The determinations made by the agencies today pertain solely to the 2015 plans and not to the 2017 or any other future resolution plans. In addition to requiring that the firms address their deficiencies, in April the agencies also identified institution-specific shortcomings, which are weaknesses identified by both agencies, but are not considered deficiencies.The agencies in April also provided guidance to be incorporated into the next full plan submission due by July 1, 2017, to the five firms, as well as Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Citigroup, and will review those plans under the statutory standard. If the agencies jointly decide that the shortcomings or the guidance are not satisfactorily addressed in a firm's 2017 plan, the agencies may determine jointly that the plan is not credible or would not facilitate an orderly resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.The decisions announced today received unanimous support from the FDIC and Federal Reserve boards."
304,12/12/2016,"The Federal Reserve Board on Monday announced additional details regarding how banking entities may seek an extension to conform their investments in a narrow class of funds that qualify as ""illiquid funds"" to the requirements of section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, commonly known as the Volcker Rule.The Board expects that the illiquid funds of banking entities will generally qualify for extensions, though extensions may not be granted in certain cases--for example, where the banking entity has not demonstrated meaningful progress to conform or divest its illiquid funds, has a deficient compliance program under the Volcker Rule, or where the Board has concerns about evasion.The Dodd-Frank Act permits the Board, upon an application by a banking entity, to provide up to an additional five years to conform investments in certain legacy illiquid funds where the banking entity had a contractual commitment to invest in the fund as of May 1, 2010. The five-year extension for certain legacy illiquid funds is the last conformance period extension that the Board is authorized to provide banking entities under the statute.According to the guidelines adopted by the Board, firms seeking an extension should submit information including details about the funds for which an extension is requested, a certification that each fund meets the definition of illiquid fund, a description of the specific efforts made to divest or conform the illiquid funds, and the length of the requested extension and the plan to divest or conform each illiquid fund within the requested extension period.Section 619 generally prohibits insured depository institutions and any company affiliated with an insured depository institution from engaging in proprietary trading and from acquiring or retaining ownership interests in, sponsoring, or having certain relationships with a hedge fund or private equity fund. These prohibitions are subject to a number of statutory exemptions, restrictions, and definitions.The rules to implement section 619 were implemented by the Board, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in December 2013. Today's action relates only to the period for conforming relationships with funds defined by section 619 as illiquid funds.The Board consulted with staffs of the other agencies charged with enforcing the requirements of section 619, and the agencies plan to administer their oversight of banking entities under their respective jurisdictions in accordance with the Board's conformance rule and the attached guidance.For media inquiries, call 202-452-2955.SR Letter"

Yellen. ""We have learned from the crisis that regulators and supervisors must consider both the strength of individual firms and of the financial system as a whole, if we are to address the risks financial instability poses for our economy. I am confident that Andreas will continue to deliver the economic expertise, common sense, and thorough analysis that we have come to rely on as we advance this work.""As division director, Mr. Lehnert will be responsible for leading the Board's work to systematically assess risks to financial stability and to develop policy responses to mitigate those risks. The Division of Financial Stability identifies and monitors significant vulnerabilities in the financial system, including from financial markets and both bank and nonbank financial institutions. It supports an active research program to evaluate the effects of monetary and regulatory policies on systemic risks and develops regulations and policies to reduce the systemic risk of banking institutions, including through the Board's annual stress tests.Lehnert earned his master's degree from the London School of Economics and his Ph.D. in economics from the University of Chicago, joining the staff of the Federal Reserve Board in 1998.Lehnert succeeds Nellie Liang, who will serve as senior adviser until her retirement early next year.For media inquiries, call 202-452-2955."

The interagency rules are intended to reduce regulatory compliance costs for smaller institutions, while maintaining safety and soundness protections. These rules have been in effect since February 29, 2016, pursuant to the interim final rules previously adopted by the agencies.Under the final rules, qualifying well-capitalized and well-managed banks and savings associations with less than $1 billion in total assets are eligible for an 18-month examination cycle. Previously, only firms with less than $500 million in total assets were eligible for the extended examination cycle. Qualifying well-capitalized and well-managed U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks with less than $1 billion in total assets are also eligible.The final rules increase the number of institutions that may qualify for an 18-month examination cycle by more than 600 to approximately 4,800 banks and savings associations. In addition, the final rules increase the number of U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks that may qualify for an 18-month examination cycle by 30 branches and agencies, to a total of 89.The agencies acted following passage of the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act by Congress in late 2015 and sought comments on interim final rules on the examination cycle earlier this year. After soliciting comment on the interim final rules, the agencies have re-issued them as final rules. The final rules are identical to the interim final rules."

The changes would not materially alter the underlying rule approved by the Board in July 2015.The amendments are being adopted without change from the proposal released for comment earlier this year. The amendments would clarify that GSIBs:Also on Friday, the Board invited comment on an interim final rule that extends the initial implementation of certain reporting requirements related to the GSIB surcharge rule.

308,12/9/2016,"The Federal Reserve Board on Friday invited comment on a proposal to fully apply the Board's existing rating system for bank holding companies to savings and loan holding companies.The Dodd-Frank Act transferred responsibility for the regulation and supervision of savings and loan holding companies to the Board, effective July 2011. Since then, the Board has applied its rating system to savings and loan holding companies on an ""indicative"" basis that describes how the savings and loan holding company would be rated. However, the assignment of an unsatisfactory indicative rating has not automatically triggered supervisory action.The Board's rating system is in part used to determine the safety and soundness of a financial institution, as well as potential supervisory responses. Fully applying the rating system to both bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies will help ensure consistent standards and supervision.The proposal would fully apply the rating system to most savings and loan holding companies supervised by the Board. However, it would not apply to savings and loan holding companies engaged in significant insurance or commercial activities. These firms would instead continue to receive indicative ratings.For media inquiries, call 202-452-2955"

310,12/6/2016,"The Federal Reserve Board on Tuesday issued a consent order to cease and desist and assessed a civil money penalty against Customers Bank of Phoenixville, Pennsylvania. The order addresses the participation of the bank and its agent, Higher One, Inc. of New Haven, Connecticut, in deceptive practices in violation of section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (FTC Act).Higher One provided institutions of higher education with financial aid disbursement services for students through, among other things, a deposit account and debit card product known as the ""OneAccount."" Because Higher One is not a bank, it had to partner with banks to offer OneAccounts. Customers has held OneAccounts since August 2013.The deceptive practices employed by Higher One, under Customers Bank's oversight for approximately four months and for which the Board is assessing a $960,000 penalty, included:Higher One took material corrective action to address these practices. In December 2015, the Board took an enforcement action against Higher One that required Higher One to refrain from future violations of the FTC Act and to provide restitution of approximately $24 million in fees to more than 500,000 students who opened accounts with Higher One while Higher One's website and marketing materials were deceptive. Under the restitution plan ordered by the Board, students who opened a OneAccount with Higher One at a Federal Reserve-regulated institution, between May 4, 2012, the date the deceptive marketing practices involving the OneAccount began, through December 19, 2013, the date Higher One took corrective measures, are being reimbursed for the fees related to the deceptive practices.

314,11/30/2016,"The Federal Reserve Board on Wednesday published a report on debit card transactions in 2015, including summary information on the volume and value, interchange fee revenue, certain issuer costs, and fraud losses. The report is the fourth in a series to be published every two years pursuant to section 920 of the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (EFTA).The Board's Regulation II (Debit Card Interchange Fees and Routing), which implements this provision of the EFTA, provides that a debit card issuer subject to the interchange fee standard (a covered issuer) may not receive an interchange fee that exceeds 21 cents plus 5 basis points (0.05%) multiplied by the value of the transaction, plus a 1-cent fraud-prevention adjustment, if eligible. The regulation does not apply to debit card issuers with consolidated assets of less than $10 billion, certain government-administered debit cards, and certain prepaid cards. The interchange fee standard became effective on October 1, 2011.As in prior years, covered issuers' costs of authorizing, clearing, and settling (ACS) debit card transactions, excluding issuer fraud losses, varied greatly across respondents in 2015. The median issuer had an average ACS cost of 12.3 cents and the issuer at the 75th percentile had an average ACS cost of 30.5 cents. Issuers with the highest debit card transaction volume generally had the lowest ACS costs per transaction. The overall average ACS cost per transaction in the industry was 4.2 cents per transaction, down from 4.6 cents per transaction in 2013.The Board estimated debit-card fraud losses to all parties (merchants, cardholders, and issuers) increased by 44 percent from 2013 to $2.41 billion in 2015, with an average loss of 10.3 basis points (0.103%) as a share of transaction value as compared to 8.0 basis points (0.08%) in 2013. The median covered issuer's average fraud loss as a share of transaction value was 6.6 basis points (0.066%), up from 5.1 in 2013. The median covered issuer had average fraud prevention and data security costs of 1.9 cents per transaction.Sixty-six percent of covered issuers had average ACS costs, including issuer fraud losses, below 21 cents plus 5 basis points (0.05%) of the value of a transaction (the base component of the interchange fee standard) in 2015. This proportion is slightly higher than the 64 percent of covered issuers with average ACS costs below the maximum interchange fee in 2013. Covered issuers with average ACS costs below the maximum interchange fee in 2015 processed more than 99 percent of all reported covered transactions, the same proportion as in 2013.For media inquiries, call 202-452-2955Board Votes2015 Interchange Fee Revenue, Covered Issuer Costs, and Covered Issuer and Merchant Fraud Losses Related to Debit Card Transactions (PDF)"

The final rule also applies the calculation method to the exemption threshold for 2017. The threshold will remain at $25,500, based on the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) in effect on June 1, 2016.The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 amended the Truth in Lending Act to add special appraisal requirements for higher-priced mortgage loans, including a requirement that creditors obtain a written appraisal based on a physical visit to the home's interior before making a higher-priced mortgage loan. The rules implementing these requirements contain an exemption for loans of $25,000 or less and also provide that the exemption threshold will be adjusted annually to reflect increases in the CPI-W.The calculation method adopted in the final rule will allow the thresholds to keep pace with the CPI-W. Among other clarifications, the final rule details that if there is no annual percentage increase in the CPI-W, the agencies will not adjust the exemption threshold from the prior year.The attached notice will be published shortly in the Federal Register."

323,3/16/2016,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in January suggests that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace despite the global economic and financial developments of recent months. Household spending has been increasing at a moderate rate, and the housing sector has improved further; however, business fixed investment and net exports have been soft. A range of recent indicators, including strong job gains, points to additional strengthening of the labor market. Inflation picked up in recent months; however, it continued to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective, partly reflecting declines in energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance, in recent months.Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee currently expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market indicators will continue to strengthen. However, global economic and financial developments continue to pose risks. Inflation is expected to remain low in the near term, in part because of earlier declines in energy prices, but to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further. The Committee continues to monitor inflation developments closely.Against this backdrop, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1/4 to 1/2 percent. The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting further improvement in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation.In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. In light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, the Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal. The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run. However, the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data.The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction, and it anticipates doing so until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under way. This policy, by keeping the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions.Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Janet L. Yellen, Chair; William C. Dudley, Vice Chairman; Lael Brainard; James Bullard; Stanley Fischer; Loretta J. Mester; Jerome H. Powell; Eric Rosengren; and Daniel K. Tarullo.

326,3/4/2016,"The Federal Reserve Board on Friday proposed a rule to address the risk associated with excessive credit exposures of large banking organizations to a single counterparty. As demonstrated during the financial crisis, large credit exposures, particularly between financial institutions, can spread financial distress and undermine financial stability.The proposal would apply single-counterparty credit limits to bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more. The proposed limits are tailored to increase in stringency as the systemic footprint of a firm increases:""We are determined to do as much as we can to reduce or eliminate the threat that trouble at one big bank will bring down other big banks,"" said Federal Reserve Board Chair Janet L. Yellen.Similarly tailored requirements would also be established for foreign banks operating in the United States.""This regulation would complement overall capital requirements, which are generally based on the size and nature of a bank's assets, but do not address the concentration of risk in specific borrowers or counterparties,"" Governor Daniel K. Tarullo said.The proposed rule implements part of the Dodd-Frank Act and builds on earlier proposals released by the Board in 2011 and 2012, and includes some modifications based on comments received. Additionally, the proposal seeks to promote global consistency by generally following the international large exposures framework released by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in 2014.The Board on Friday also released a white paper explaining the analytical and quantitative reasoning for the proposed rule's tighter 15 percent limit for credit exposures between systemically important financial institutions. Because systemically important financial institutions are generally engaged in similar activities and exposed to similar risks, the paper discusses why systemically important firms are more likely to come under stress at the same time and, as a result, generally incur more risk when exposed to other systemically important firms compared to non-systemically important counterparties.Comments on the proposed rule are invited until June 3, 2016.For media inquiries, call 202-452-2955.Federal Register Notice: PDF | HTMLCalibrating the Single-Counterparty Credit Limit between Systemically Important Financial Institutions (PDF) | HTMLOpening Statement by Chair Janet L.

327,3/4/2016,"WASHINGTON--The federal banking agencies today issued an advisory to clarify expectations for the use of property evaluations by banking institutions. The advisory responds to questions raised during outreach meetings held by the agencies last year pursuant to the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act.The advisory describes the agencies' existing supervisory expectations for the use of an evaluation instead of an appraisal to estimate a property's market value for certain real estate-related financial transactions. Unlike an appraisal, an evaluation does not have to be developed by a state-licensed or state-certified appraiser.The advisory also addresses the use of alternative valuation approaches, methods, and other information that financial institutions may use to develop an evaluation in areas with few, if any, recent comparable property sales in reasonable proximity to the subject property. Regardless of the approach or method used to estimate the market value of real property, an evaluation report should contain sufficient information and analysis to support the value conclusion and the institution's decision to engage in the transaction.Related Links"

331,2/19/2016,"The Federal Reserve Board on Friday approved the reappointment of 10 Federal Reserve Bank presidents and 10 first vice presidents by their respective boards of directors. Each individual has been approved to serve a new five-year term beginning March 1, 2016. The recently named presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks of Minneapolis and Dallas, as well as the recently appointed first vice presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks of Philadelphia and Chicago, were approved for terms to February 28, 2021, at the time of their initial appointments.Under section 4 of the Federal Reserve Act, all Reserve Bank presidents and first vice presidents serve five-year terms that expire at the end of February in years ending in 1 or 6. Generally, presidents and first vice presidents who take office in intervening years are initially appointed for the remainder of the current term. Before the expiration of a president's term, the Class B and C directors of each Reserve Bank who are not affiliated with a supervised entity vote on whether to reappoint the president or first vice president to a new term.""The leaders of the Reserve Banks have important jobs and are expected to perform at a high level,"" said Governor Jerome H. Powell, chairman of the Board's Committee on Reserve Bank Affairs. ""The eligible Reserve Bank directors, with significant input from the Board of Governors, conduct a rigorous process to inform their reappointment decisions.""The reappointments by the boards of directors are based on performance assessments that include consideration of factors such as the ability of their president to effectively lead the Reserve Bank, the president's performance in achieving the Reserve Bank's and Federal Reserve System's objectives, and the president's ability to effectively represent the Federal Reserve to the public. The performance appraisal of the first vice president considers strategic leadership of the Reserve Bank, with a focus on operational areas and organization development, as well as contributions to System initiatives.Class B and C directors are a diverse group representing a wide range of business and community interests that are affected by Federal Reserve policies. An understanding of how the presidents are viewed in their respective Districts, which may be complemented with additional outreach to constituent representatives, helps to inform the directors' performance reviews.In addition, each president's performance is discussed annually by the chair and deputy chair of each Reserve Bank board and the Board of Governors' Committee on Federal Reserve Bank Affairs, and the performance of each first vice president is discussed by that group and the Bank's president.A list of presidents and first vice presidents, by Federal Reserve District, follows. The Board had previously approved terms to 2021 for Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis president Neel T. Kashkari, Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas president Robert S.

332,2/19/2016,"Federal banking agencies today increased the number of small banks and savings associations eligible for an 18-month examination cycle rather than a 12-month cycle. The changes are intended to reduce regulatory compliance costs for smaller institutions, while still maintaining safety and soundness protections.Under the interim final rules, qualifying well-capitalized and well-managed banks and savings associations with less than $1 billion in total assets may now be eligible for an 18-month examination cycle. Previously, firms with less than $500 million in total assets could be eligible for the extended examination cycle. The examination cycle changes may also apply to qualifying well-capitalized and well-managed U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks with less than $1 billion in total assets.Regulators consider institutions to be well-capitalized and well-managed if they have a composite rating of 1 or 2--the top ratings in the five-point scale indicating the safety and soundness of a bank or savings association. The changes were implemented by the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of the Comptroller Currency.The rules increase the number of institutions that may qualify for an 18-month examination cycle by approximately 617, to nearly 5,000 banks and savings associations. In addition, the rules increase the number of U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks that may qualify for an 18-month examination cycle by 26 branches and agencies, to a total of 89.The agencies acted following passage of the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act by Congress in late 2015.

339,2/11/2016,"The Federal Reserve Board on Thursday announced the repeal of one regulation and a proposal to repeal a second in order to comply with statutory provisions that transferred certain consumer protection rulewriting authority to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).The Board repealed its Regulation AA (Unfair or Deceptive Acts or Practices) as proposed in August 2014 and is inviting public comment on the proposed repeal of Regulation C (Home Mortgage Disclosure).The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) repealed the Board's authority to write rules that address unfair or deceptive acts or practices, which were contained in Regulation AA. Regulation AA included the Board's ""credit practices rule,"" which prohibited banks from using certain practices to enforce consumer credit obligations and from including these practices in their consumer credit contracts. The Dodd-Frank Act provides the CFPB separate authority to promulgate rules to identify and prohibit unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices.The Dodd-Frank Act also transferred rulemaking authority for the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act from the Board to the CFPB. The CFPB has issued final rules that supersede the Board's Regulation C.

341,6/18/2015,"The Federal Reserve Board on Thursday announced the approval of a final rule amending Regulation D (Reserve Requirements of Depository Institutions) to make changes to the calculation of interest payments on excess balances maintained by depository institutions at Federal Reserve Banks. The final rule is a matter of prudent planning and has no implications for the near-term conduct of monetary policy.Under the former rule, if the rate of interest paid on excess balances (the IOER rate) had changed in the middle of a two‑week reserve maintenance period, the change would not have been fully reflected in the interest payments to depository institutions until the beginning of a new maintenance period. The final rule bases interest payments to depository institutions with excess balances on the IOER rate in effect each day and the level of balances held each day, rather than on the average IOER rate and average level of excess balances over the maintenance period.The changes are intended to enhance the effectiveness of changes in the IOER rate in moving the federal funds rate into the target range established by the Federal Open Market Committee when changes in those rates do not coincide with the beginning of a maintenance period.The final rule is the same as the proposal that was published on April 13. It will become effective on July 23, 2015, the beginning of the first reserve maintenance period more than 30 days after publication in the Federal Register.

344,6/17/2015,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in April suggests that economic activity has been expanding moderately after having changed little during the first quarter. The pace of job gains picked up while the unemployment rate remained steady. On balance, a range of labor market indicators suggests that underutilization of labor resources diminished somewhat. Growth in household spending has been moderate and the housing sector has shown some improvement; however, business fixed investment and net exports stayed soft. Inflation continued to run below the Committee's longer-run objective, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and decreasing prices of non-energy imports; energy prices appear to have stabilized. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, with labor market indicators continuing to move toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate. The Committee continues to see the risks to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market as nearly balanced. Inflation is anticipated to remain near its recent low level in the near term, but the Committee expects inflation to rise gradually toward 2 percent over the medium term as the labor market improves further and the transitory effects of earlier declines in energy and import prices dissipate. The Committee continues to monitor inflation developments closely.To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee today reaffirmed its view that the current 0 to 1/4 percent target range for the federal funds rate remains appropriate. In determining how long to maintain this target range, the Committee will assess progress--both realized and expected--toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. The Committee anticipates that it will be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate when it has seen further improvement in the labor market and is reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term.The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction. This policy, by keeping the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions.When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent. The Committee currently anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run.Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Janet L. Yellen, Chair; William C. Dudley, Vice Chairman; Lael Brainard; Charles L. Evans; Stanley Fischer; Jeffrey M. Lacker; Dennis P. Lockhart; Jerome H. Powell; Daniel K. Tarullo; and John C. Williams."

352,6/9/2015,"Federal agencies today issued a final interagency policy statement establishing joint standards for assessing the diversity policies and practices of the entities they regulate.Section 342 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank Act) required the Federal Reserve Board, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the National Credit Union Administration, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Securities and Exchange Commission to establish an Office of Minority and Women Inclusion (OMWI) at each agency to be responsible for all matters relating to diversity in management, employment, and business activities. The Dodd-Frank Act also instructed each OMWI director to develop standards for assessing the diversity policies and practices of the agencies' regulated entities.The final standards, which are generally similar to the proposed standards, provide a framework for regulated entities to create and strengthen their diversity policies and practices--including their organizational commitment to diversity, workforce and employment practices, procurement and business practices, and practices to promote transparency of organizational diversity and inclusion within the entities' U.S. operations.The final interagency policy statement reflects the collective efforts of the agencies. The agencies held extensive discussions with depository institutions, holding companies, and industry trade groups, in which the agencies solicited their views on appropriate standards and information about the successes and challenges of existing diversity policies and programs. The agencies also consulted with financial professionals, consumer advocates, and community representatives in the discussions to gain a greater understanding of the issues confronting minorities and women in obtaining employment and business opportunities within the financial services industry. The policy statement reflects the consideration of more than 200 comments submitted on the proposed standards that were issued in 2013. The final interagency policy statement is effective on publication in the Federal Register.In addition to the final standards issued today, the agencies are asking for public comments on the information collection aspects of the final joint standards as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act.

The third notice, published today, seeks comment on regulations in three additional categories: consumer protection; directors, officers, and employees; and money laundering. Comments will be accepted within 90 days after publication in the Federal Register.The agencies will jointly publish an additional Federal Register notice, with the remaining three categories. Although each notice seeks comment on three specific categories, comments on any of the 12 categories will be accepted by the agencies.Additionally, as previously announced by the agencies, the agencies have expanded the scope of the EGRPRA review to cover newly issued regulations. Comments will be accepted on all rules that have been finalized before the publication of the last EGRPRA notice which is expected by year-end.The agencies also are holding a series of outreach meetings with financial institutions and interested parties to gather additional views.

360,10/23/2014,"The Federal Reserve Board on Thursday issued the supervisory scenarios that will be used in the 2015 capital planning and stress testing program. The program includes the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) of 31 bank holding companies with $50 billion or more of total consolidated assets.The aim of the annual reviews is to ensure that large financial institutions have robust, forward-looking capital planning processes that account for their unique risks, and to help ensure that they have sufficient capital to continue operations throughout times of economic and financial stress. Capital is important to banking organizations, the financial system, and the economy broadly because it acts as a cushion to absorb losses and helps to ensure that losses are borne by shareholders, not taxpayers.The Federal Reserve will require institutions to use the supervisory scenarios in both the stress tests conducted as part of the CCAR and in the stress tests that are part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Some companies that are not part of CCAR, including state member bank subsidiaries of CCAR participants and some companies with between $10 billion and $50 billion in assets, also will use the supervisory scenarios for Dodd-Frank Act stress tests.The baseline, adverse, and severely adverse scenarios include 28 variables, including economic activity, unemployment, exchange rates, prices, incomes, and interest rates. The adverse and severely adverse scenarios describe hypothetical sets of events designed to assess the strength of banking organizations and their resilience to adverse economic environments. They are not forecasts. The baseline scenario follows a similar profile to the average projections from surveys of economic forecasters. It does not represent the forecast of the Federal Reserve.The Federal Reserve is publishing a narrative that describes the general conditions in the scenarios and changes in the scenarios from previous years.As in prior years, six bank holding companies with large trading operations will be required to factor in a global market shock as part of their scenarios. The Federal Reserve intends to provide the data for the global market shock scenario as soon as it is possible, but no later than December 1, 2014.In addition, for the second consecutive year, eight bank holding companies with substantial trading or custodial operations will be required to incorporate a counterparty default scenario.

363,10/22/2014,"Six federal agencies approved a final rule requiring sponsors of securitization transactions to retain risk in those transactions. The final rule implements the risk retention requirements in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act).The final rule is being issued jointly by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Securities and Exchange Commission. As provided under the Dodd-Frank Act, the Secretary of the Treasury, as Chairperson of the Financial Stability Oversight Council, played a coordinating role in the joint agency rulemaking.The final rule largely retains the risk retention framework contained in the proposal issued by the agencies in August 2013 and generally requires sponsors of asset-backed securities (ABS) to retain not less than five percent of the credit risk of the assets collateralizing the ABS issuance. The rule also sets forth prohibitions on transferring or hedging the credit risk that the sponsor is required to retain.As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the final rule defines a ""qualified residential mortgage"" (QRM) and exempts securitizations of QRMs from the risk retention requirement. The final rule aligns the QRM definition with that of a qualified mortgage as defined by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The final rule also requires the agencies to review the definition of QRM no later than four years after the effective date of the rule with respect to the securitization of residential mortgages and every five years thereafter, and allows each agency to request a review of the definition at any time. The final rule also does not require any retention for securitizations of commercial loans, commercial mortgages, or automobile loans if they meet specific standards for high quality underwriting.The final rule will be effective one year after publication in the Federal Register for residential mortgage-backed securitizations and two years after publication for all other securitization types.Federal Register notice: HTML | PDFMeeting MemorandaOpen Board Meeting on October 22, 2014Board Votes"

367,10/17/2014,"The Federal Reserve Board on Friday issued a final rule to modify the regulations for capital planning and stress testing and released instructions for the 2015 capital planning cycle.The final rule adjusts the due date for bank holding companies (BHCs) with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more to submit their capital plans and stress test results. For the 2015 capital plan cycle, these BHCs are required to submit capital plans on or before January 5, 2015, unchanged from prior years. For subsequent cycles, beginning in 2016, participating BHCs will be required to submit their capital plans and stress testing results to the Federal Reserve on or before April 5.In addition to the timing change, the final rule includes modifications and clarifications to the existing capital plans and stress test rules. In particular, the final rule adopts the limitation on a BHC's ability to make capital distributions to the extent that the BHC's actual capital issuances are less than the amount indicated in its capital plan, with adjustments to address commenters' concerns. The final rule is largely identical to the proposed rule, with a few key adjustments, including certain technical revisions and clarifications made in response to comments from the public.The final rule marks another step in the Federal Reserve's ongoing efforts to adapt and improve its capital planning and stress testing process as the program's fifth cycle begins.""Born of necessity during the depths of the financial crisis as part of an effort to restore confidence in the U.S. financial system, supervisory stress testing has become a cornerstone of a new approach to regulation and supervision of the nation's largest financial institutions,"" Gov. Daniel K. Tarullo said. ""If supervisory stress testing and the associated review of capital planning processes are to give regulators, banks, and the public a dynamic view of the capital positions of large financial firms, they must respond to changes in the economy, the financial system, and risk-management capabilities.""The Federal Reserve's capital planning and stress testing program includes the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) of large bank holding companies. The aim of the annual reviews is to ensure that large financial institutions have robust, forward-looking capital planning processes that account for their unique risks, and to help ensure that they have sufficient capital to continue operations throughout times of economic and financial stress. Capital is important to banking organizations, the financial system, and the economy broadly because it acts as a cushion to absorb losses and helps to ensure that losses are borne by shareholders, not taxpayers.The capital planning and stress testing program led by the Federal Reserve since the financial crisis has contributed to a significant increase in capital at the largest banking organizations in the United States. The 30 large BHCs that participated in CCAR last year have increased their aggregate tier 1 common capital to $971 billion as of the fourth quarter of 2013, from $460 billion as of the first quarter of 2009. The tier 1 common ratio for these firms has more than doubled during that time period to a weighted average of 11.1 percent from 5.3 percent.Thirty-one large BHCs are participating in CCAR in 2015. All but one of those firms, Deutsche Bank Trust Corporation, participated in CCAR in 2014.The instructions issued Friday for CCAR 2015 provide details regarding submission requirements, supervisory expectations for a capital adequacy process, and the supervisory assessments and disclosure. Further, for the first time, the instructions include a discussion of common strengths and shortcomings seen in the submissions by the participating BHCs in the prior year.The instructions are being provided ahead of the supervisory scenarios this year to provide firms with additional time for implementation.

Following the recent financial crisis, global financial regulators have focused on the potential for such contractual rights to disrupt the execution of an orderly resolution of a major global banking firm.This initiative is an important step toward mitigating the financial stability risks associated with the early termination of bilateral, OTC derivatives contracts triggered by the failure of a global banking firm with significant cross-border derivatives activities. Initially, 18 large banking organizations have agreed to sign onto the protocol. The protocol provides for temporary stays on certain default and early termination rights within standard ISDA derivatives contracts in the event one of the large banking organizations is subject to an insolvency or resolution proceeding in its home jurisdiction.The resolution stay amendments of the protocol are intended to facilitate an orderly resolution of a major global banking firm and reduce the potential negative impact of the resolution on financial stability by giving the bankruptcy court or resolution authority the ability to prevent early termination of financial contracts of the firm's global subsidiaries. The Federal Reserve and the FDIC are encouraged by this effort and look forward to the continuation of this important work."

These companies are required to perform their first stress tests under the Dodd-Frank Act by March 31, 2014.The agencies' stress test rules are flexible to accommodate different risk profiles, sizes, business mixes, market footprints, and complexity for companies in the $10 billion to $50 billion asset range. Consistent with this flexibility, the final guidance describes general supervisory expectations for these companies' Dodd-Frank Act stress tests, and, where appropriate, provides examples of practices that would be consistent with those expectations.The final guidance from the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is similar to proposed guidance issued by the agencies last year.

Results will be released for both exercises at 4 p.m. EDT.The Dodd-Frank Act stress tests are forward-looking exercises conducted by the Federal Reserve and large financial companies supervised by the Federal Reserve. The exercises help assess whether institutions have sufficient capital to absorb losses and support operations during adverse economic and financial market conditions over a period of nine quarters. The Dodd-Frank Act supervisory stress test results will include data such as post-stress capital ratios, revenue, and loss estimates under hypothetical adverse and severely adverse scenarios provided by the Federal Reserve. The capital ratios assume a common set of capital actions for all of the firms. The standardized capital actions used in the Dodd-Frank Act stress test results provide for comparability across the firms as they assume no changes in recent levels of dividend payments and no common stock repurchases.CCAR is an annual exercise by the Federal Reserve to help assess whether the companies have robust, forward-looking capital planning processes that account for their unique risks and are supported by the firms' risk-measurement and -management practices. As part of the CCAR, the Federal Reserve evaluates each company's plans to make capital distributions, such as dividend payments, stock repurchases, or planned acquisitions. CCAR results will include post-stress capital ratios under hypothetical adverse and severely adverse scenarios provided by the Federal Reserve and will reflect the capital actions the companies plan to undertake during the nine-quarter period. In addition to the quantitative results, the Federal Reserve will indicate whether it has objected to a firm's capital plan based on qualitative grounds.To see the instructions and scenarios for the 2014 Dodd-Frank Act stress tests and CCAR, go to www.federalreserve.gov/bankinforeg/stress-tests-capital-planning.htm.For media inquiries, call 202-452-2955."

395,2/21/2014,"The Federal Reserve Board and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency on Friday permitted certain banking organizations to begin using an additional approach to determine their risk-based capital requirements.Under the agencies' ""Advanced Approaches"" capital framework, which implements standards developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, firms must meet specific risk measurement and management criteria when calculating their risk-based capital requirements. The framework applies to large, internationally active banking organizations--generally those with at least $250 billion in total consolidated assets or at least $10 billion in total on-balance sheet foreign exposure--and includes the depository institution subsidiaries of those firms.Before a banking organization may use the Advanced Approaches framework to determine its risk-based capital requirements, it must conduct a satisfactory trial, or ""parallel run,"" using the Advanced Approaches framework. Under the supervision of its regulator, a firm must show it can comply with the Advanced Approaches framework during the parallel run period for at least four consecutive calendar quarters using risk-measurement and risk-management systems that adhere to the Advanced Approaches framework.Eight bank holding companies, eight national banks, and four state member banks have completed their parallel run: The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation, the Bank of New York Mellon, and BNY Mellon National Association; Citigroup Inc. and Citibank, NA; The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and Goldman Sachs Bank USA; JPMorgan Chase & Co., JPMorgan Chase Bank, NA, Chase Bank USA National Association, and JPMorgan Bank and Trust Company, National Association; Morgan Stanley, Morgan Stanley Bank, NA, and Morgan Stanley Private Bank, NA; Northern Trust Corporation and The Northern Trust Company; State Street Corporation and State Street Bank and Trust Company; and U.S. Bancorp and U.S. Bank National Association. These firms will use the Advanced Approaches framework to calculate and publicly disclose their risk-based capital ratios beginning with the second quarter of 2014. Under the capital rules finalized by U.S. regulators in July 2013, these firms must meet the minimum risk-based capital ratios under both the Advanced Approaches and the generally applicable risk-based capital frameworks.Also on Friday, the Federal Reserve Board issued a final rule clarifying that bank holding companies using the Advanced Approaches framework will incorporate those changes into the capital planning and stress testing cycles that begin October 1, 2015. The Board previously adopted two interim final rules requiring firms to incorporate the Advanced Approaches framework into their capital planning and stress testing cycles that begin October 1, 2014. The final rule provides the Federal Reserve and the institutions additional time to integrate the Advanced Approaches framework into their respective stress testing and capital planning processes.Federal Register notice: HTML | PDF"

397,2/18/2014,"The Federal Reserve Board on Tuesday approved a final rule strengthening supervision and regulation of large U.S. bank holding companies and foreign banking organizations.The final rule establishes a number of enhanced prudential standards for large U.S. bank holding companies and foreign banking organizations to help increase the resiliency of their operations. These standards include liquidity, risk management, and capital. It also requires a foreign banking organization with a significant U.S. presence to establish an intermediate holding company over its U.S. subsidiaries, which will facilitate consistent supervision and regulation of the U.S. operations of the foreign bank. The final rule was required by section 165 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.""As the financial crisis demonstrated, the sudden failure or near failure of large financial institutions can have destabilizing effects on the financial system and harm the broader economy,"" Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said. ""And, as the crisis also highlighted, the traditional framework for supervising and regulating major financial institutions and assessing risks contained material weaknesses. The final rule addresses these sources of vulnerability.""For U.S. bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, the final rule incorporates the previously issued capital planning and stress testing requirements as an enhanced prudential standard. It also requires such a U.S. bank holding company to comply with enhanced risk-management and liquidity risk-management standards, conduct liquidity stress tests, and hold a buffer of highly liquid assets based on projected funding needs during a 30-day stress event. These requirements will help ensure that these firms can continue to lend to households and businesses even in times of financial stress. In addition, the final rule requires publicly traded U.S. bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more to establish enterprise-wide risk committees. The new requirements for U.S. bank holding companies complement the stress testing and resolution planning requirements for large bank holding companies that the Board previously finalized.The final rule will not apply to nonbank financial companies that are designated by the Financial Stability Oversight Council for Federal Reserve supervision. Instead, the Federal Reserve Board said it will apply enhanced prudential standards to these institutions through a subsequently issued order or rule following an evaluation of the business model, capital structure, and risk profile of each designated nonbank financial company. In addition, the final rule does not implement single-counterparty credit limits or early remediation requirements for U.S. or foreign banking organizations, which will be implemented at a later date following further study.For foreign financial institutions, the final rule recognizes that the U.S. operations of foreign banking organizations have become more complex, interconnected, and concentrated in recent years. The requirements in the final rule will bolster the capital and liquidity positions of the U.S. operations of foreign banking organizations and promote a level playing field among all banking firms operating in the United States. Foreign banking organizations with U.S. non-branch assets of $50 billion or more will be required to establish a U.S. intermediate holding company over their U.S. subsidiaries. The foreign-owned U.S. intermediate holding company generally will be subject to the same risk-based and leverage capital standards applicable to U.S. bank holding companies. The intermediate holding companies also will be subject to the Federal Reserve's rules requiring regular capital plans and stress tests.""The most important contribution we can make to the global financial system is to ensure the stability of the U.S. financial system,"" Daniel K. Tarullo said.Like U.S. bank holding companies with assets of $50 billion or more, a foreign banking organization with combined U.S. assets of $50 billion or more will be required to establish a U.S. risk committee and employ a U.S. chief risk officer to help ensure that the foreign bank understands and manages the risks of its combined U.S. operations. In addition, these foreign banking organizations will be required to meet enhanced liquidity risk-management standards, conduct liquidity stress tests, and hold a buffer of highly liquid assets based on projected funding needs during a 30-day stress event. Foreign banking organizations with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, but combined U.S. assets of less than $50 billion, are subject to enhanced prudential standards. However, the capital, liquidity, risk-management, and stress testing requirements applicable to these foreign banking organizations are substantially less than those applicable to foreign banking organizations with a larger U.S. presence. In addition, the final rule implements stress testing requirements for foreign banking organizations with total consolidated assets of more than $10 billion and risk committee requirements for foreign banking organizations that meet the asset threshold and are publicly traded.The final rule for foreign banking organizations includes several adjustments in response to comments. For example, the final rule raises the threshold for requiring a U.S. intermediate holding company from $10 billion to $50 billion of U.S. non-branch assets and extends the initial compliance date for foreign banking organizations to July 1, 2016, a year later than originally proposed. The final rule also generally defers application of the leverage ratio to foreign-owned U.S. intermediate holding companies until 2018.U.S. bank holding companies subject to the rule will need to comply by January 1, 2015.The Federal Reserve consulted with other members of the Financial Stability Oversight Council in developing the final rule.For media inquiries, call 202-452-2955.Statement by Chair Janet L.

Under the Dodd-Frank Act, mortgage loans are considered to be higher-priced if they are secured by a consumer's home and have interest rates above a certain threshold.The proposed rule would provide that the following three types of higher-priced mortgage loans would be exempt from the Dodd-Frank Act appraisal requirements: loans of $25,000 or less; certain ""streamlined"" refinancings; and certain loans secured by manufactured housing.In January 2013, a final rule implementing the new Dodd-Frank Act appraisal requirements was issued by the Federal Reserve Board, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the National Credit Union Administration, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Compliance with the final rule will become mandatory on January 18, 2014. These same agencies are jointly issuing the proposed rule on additional exemptions in response to public comments previously received.The Federal Register notice is attached. The agencies are seeking comments from the public on all aspects of the proposal. The public will have until September 9, 2013, to review and comment on most of the proposal. However, comments related to the proposed Paperwork Reduction Act analysis will be due 60 days after the rule is published in the Federal Register. Publication of the proposal in the Federal Register is expected shortly.Federal Register notice: HTML | PDFBoard Votes"

407,7/9/2013,"The Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) on Tuesday proposed a rule to strengthen the leverage ratio standards for the largest, most systemically significant U.S. banking organizations.Under the proposed rule, bank holding companies with more than $700 billion in consolidated total assets or $10 trillion in assets under custody (covered BHCs) would be required to maintain a tier 1 capital leverage buffer of at least 2 percent above the minimum supplementary leverage ratio requirement of 3 percent, for a total of 5 percent. Failure to exceed the 5 percent ratio would subject covered BHCs to restrictions on discretionary bonus payments and capital distributions. In addition to the leverage buffer for covered BHCs, the proposed rule would require insured depository institutions of covered BHCs to meet a 6 percent supplementary leverage ratio to be considered ""well capitalized"" for prompt corrective action purposes. The proposed rule would currently apply to the eight largest, most systemically significant U.S. banking organizations.Also on Tuesday, the FDIC Board approved a capital interim final rule and the OCC approved a final capital rule identical in substance to the final rules issued by the Federal Reserve Board on July 2, 2013.A strong capital base at the largest, most systemically significant U.S. banking organizations is particularly important because capital shortfalls at these institutions have the potential to result in significant adverse economic consequences and contribute to systemic distress both domestically and internationally. Higher capital standards for these institutions will place additional private capital at risk before the federal deposit insurance fund and the federal government's resolution mechanisms would be called upon, and reduce the likelihood of economic disruptions caused by problems at these institutions.The agencies are proposing a substantial phase-in period for the rule with an effective date of January 1, 2018.

411,7/2/2013,"The Federal Reserve Board on Tuesday approved a final rule to help ensure banks maintain strong capital positions that will enable them to continue lending to creditworthy households and businesses even after unforeseen losses and during severe economic downturns.The final rule minimizes burden on smaller, less complex financial institutions. It establishes an integrated regulatory capital framework that addresses shortcomings in capital requirements, particularly for larger, internationally active banking organizations, that became apparent during the recent financial crisis. The rule will implement in the United States the Basel III regulatory capital reforms from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain changes required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.""This framework requires banking organizations to hold more and higher quality capital, which acts as a financial cushion to absorb losses, while reducing the incentive for firms to take excessive risks,"" Chairman Ben Bernanke said. ""With these revisions to our capital rules, banking organizations will be better able to withstand periods of financial stress, thus contributing to the overall health of the U.S. economy.""Under the final rule, minimum requirements will increase for both the quantity and quality of capital held by banking organizations. Consistent with the international Basel framework, the rule includes a new minimum ratio of common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 4.5 percent and a common equity tier 1 capital conservation buffer of 2.5 percent of risk-weighted assets that will apply to all supervised financial institutions. The rule also raises the minimum ratio of tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets from 4 percent to 6 percent and includes a minimum leverage ratio of 4 percent for all banking organizations. In addition, for the largest, most internationally active banking organizations, the final rule includes a new minimum supplementary leverage ratio that takes into account off-balance sheet exposures.On the quality of capital side, the final rule emphasizes common equity tier 1 capital, the most loss-absorbing form of capital, and implements strict eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments. The final rule also improves the methodology for calculating risk-weighted assets to enhance risk sensitivity. Banks and regulators use risk weighting to assign different levels of risk to different classes of assets--riskier assets require higher capital cushions and less risky assets require smaller capital cushions.""Adoption of the capital rules today is a milestone in our post-crisis efforts to make the financial system safer,"" Governor Daniel Tarullo said. ""Along with the stress testing and capital review measures we have already implemented, and the additional rules for large institutions that are on the way, these new rules are an essential component of a set of mutually reinforcing capital requirements.""The banking agencies carefully reviewed the comments received on the proposal and made a number of changes in the final rule, in particular to address concerns about regulatory burden on community banks.  For example, the final rule is significantly different from the proposal in terms of risk weighting for residential mortgages and the regulatory capital treatment of certain unrealized gains and losses and trust preferred securities for community banking organizations.In total, for community banks, the changes from current regulations target a few areas that are higher risk, but are otherwise minimal. Indeed, nine out of 10 financial institutions with less than $10 billion in assets would meet the common equity tier 1 minimum plus buffer of 7 percent in the final rule, according to data from March 2013.As with all financial institutions subject to the final rule, community banks will have a significant transition period to meet the new requirements. The phase-in period for smaller, less complex banking organizations will not begin until January 2015 while the phase-in period for larger institutions begins in January 2014. In another change from the proposal, savings and loan holding companies with significant commercial or insurance underwriting activities will not be subject to the final rule at this time. The Federal Reserve will take additional time to evaluate the appropriate regulatory capital framework for these entities.The Federal Reserve coordinated the final rule with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), which continue to review this matter. The FDIC has provided notice that it will consider the matter as an interim final rule on July 9, 2013. The OCC expects to review and consider the matter as a final rule by July 9, 2013.Federal Register notice: HTML | PDFCommunity Bank Guide (PDF)Board VotesFor media inquiries, call 202-452-2955Meeting MemorandaOpen Board Meeting on July 2, 2013"
412,7/1/2013,"The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency today issued the host state loan-to-deposit ratios that the banking agencies will use to determine compliance with section 109 of the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994. These ratios update data released on June 29, 2012.In general, section 109 prohibits a bank from establishing or acquiring a branch or branches outside of its home state primarily for the purpose of deposit production. Section 109 also prohibits branches of banks controlled by out-of-state bank holding companies from operating primarily for the purpose of deposit production.Section 109 provides a process to test compliance with the statutory requirements. The first step in the process involves a loan-to-deposit ratio screen that compares a bank's statewide loan-to-deposit ratio to the host state loan-to-deposit ratio for banks in a particular state.A second step is conducted if a bank's statewide loan-to-deposit ratio is less than one-half of the published ratio for that state or if data are not available at the bank to conduct the first step. The second step requires the appropriate banking agency to determine whether the bank is reasonably helping to meet the credit needs of the communities served by the bank's interstate branches.A bank that fails both steps is in violation of section 109 and is subject to sanctions by the appropriate banking agency.The updated host state loan-to-deposit ratios are attached."

416,6/19/2013,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in May suggests that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace. Labor market conditions have shown further improvement in recent months, on balance, but the unemployment rate remains elevated. Household spending and business fixed investment advanced, and the housing sector has strengthened further, but fiscal policy is restraining economic growth. Partly reflecting transitory influences, inflation has been running below the Committee's longer-run objective, but longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic growth will proceed at a moderate pace and the unemployment rate will gradually decline toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate. The Committee sees the downside risks to the outlook for the economy and the labor market as having diminished since the fall. The Committee also anticipates that inflation over the medium term likely will run at or below its 2 percent objective.To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate, the Committee decided to continue purchasing additional agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $40 billion per month and longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $45 billion per month. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction. Taken together, these actions should maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative.The Committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments in coming months. The Committee will continue its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability. The Committee is prepared to increase or reduce the pace of its purchases to maintain appropriate policy accommodation as the outlook for the labor market or inflation changes. In determining the size, pace, and composition of its asset purchases, the Committee will continue to take appropriate account of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases as well as the extent of progress toward its economic objectives.To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee expects that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens. In particular, the Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and currently anticipates that this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored. In determining how long to maintain a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy, the Committee will also consider other information, including additional measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments. When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent.Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S. Bernanke, Chairman; William C. Dudley, Vice Chairman; Elizabeth A. Duke; Charles L. Evans; Jerome H. Powell; Sarah Bloom Raskin; Eric S. Rosengren; Jeremy C. Stein; Daniel K. Tarullo; and Janet L. Yellen. Voting against the action was James Bullard, who believed that the Committee should signal more strongly its willingness to defend its inflation goal in light of recent low inflation readings, and Esther L. George, who was concerned that the continued high level of monetary accommodation increased the risks of future economic and financial imbalances and, over time, could cause an increase in long-term inflation expectations."

424,8/27/2012,"The Federal Reserve Board is considering changes to the implementation timeline for the annual company-run stress test requirements required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The changes under consideration would delay implementation until September 2013 for bank holding companies, state member banks, and savings and loan holding companies with between $10 billion and $50 billion in total consolidated assets.The Federal Reserve in December 2011 issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to implement the enhanced prudential standards and early remediation requirements established under the Dodd-Frank Act. The December 2011 proposal would require all bank holding companies and state member banks with more than $10 billion in total consolidated assets to comply with the requirements to conduct an annual company-run stress test beginning on the effective date of the final rule. The December 2011 proposal would also require all savings and loan holding companies with more than $10 billion in assets to comply with the annual company-run stress test requirements once those holding companies become subject to minimum risk-based capital requirements.A number of commenters on the proposal raised concerns about the proposed timing of compliance with the company-run stress test requirements, specifically questioning if all institutions would have the resources, readiness, and ability to conduct stress tests given the likely short period between publication of a final rule and the start of the stress testing process. A key priority in implementing the stress testing requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act is to ensure that companies have robust systems and processes to conduct the stress tests. In response to the concerns expressed in comments, the Board is considering delaying the effective date of the rule to conduct the annual stress tests for bank holding companies, state member banks, and savings and loan holding companies with between $10 billion and $50 billion in total consolidated assets. The delay under consideration would help ensure that these companies have sufficient time to develop high-quality stress testing programs.As part of efforts among the federal banking agencies to coordinate the implementation of Dodd-Frank stress testing requirements, the Federal Reserve has consulted on this proposed implementation delay with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). The OCC and FDIC are considering similar changes to timelines included in their proposed rules implementing Dodd-Frank stress test requirements.Additional details about the timing and scope of Dodd-Frank stress test requirements for bank holding companies, state member banks, and savings and loan holding companies with between $10 billion and $50 billion in total consolidated assets will be included in a forthcoming final rule.For media inquiries, call 202-452-2955"

426,8/27/2012,"The credit quality of large loan commitments owned by U.S. banking organizations, foreign banking organizations (FBOs), and nonbanks improved in 2012 for the third consecutive year, according to the Shared National Credits (SNC) Review for 2012. A loan commitment is the obligation of a lender to make loans or issue letters of credit pursuant to a formal loan agreement.The volume of criticized loans remained high at $295 billion compared with levels before the financial crisis, but declined 8.1 percent from 2011. A criticized loan is rated special mention, substandard, doubtful, or loss.Reasons for improvement in credit quality included better operating performance among borrowers, debt restructurings, bankruptcy resolutions, and ongoing access to bond and equity markets.Despite this progress, poorly underwritten loans originated in 2006 and 2007 continued to adversely affect the SNC portfolio. While the overall quality of underwriting of SNCs that were originated in 2011 was significantly better than in 2007, some easing of standards was noted, specifically in leveraged finance credits, especially compared with the relatively tighter standards present in 2009 and the latter half of 2008. Refinancing risk eased during the past year as 37.1 percent of SNCs will mature over the next three years compared with 63.4 percent for the same time frame in the 2011 SNC Review.The federal banking agencies expect banks and thrifts to originate syndicated loans using prudential underwriting standards, regardless of their intent to hold or sell them. SNCs that are poorly underwritten will be subject to regulatory criticism or classification during annual SNC reviews. The federal banking agencies expect to finalize revised guidance on leveraged lending to form the basis of the agencies' supervisory focus and review of supervised financial institutions involved in leveraged lending.Although nonbank entities, such as securitization pools, hedge funds, insurance companies, and pension funds, owned the smallest share of loan commitments, they owned the largest share (62.4 percent) of classified credits (rated substandard, doubtful, or loss).In other highlights of the review:The SNC program was established in 1977 to provide an efficient and consistent review and analysis of SNCs.  A SNC is any loan or formal loan commitment, and any asset such as real estate, stocks, notes, bonds, and debentures taken as debts previously contracted, extended to borrowers by a federally supervised institution, its subsidiaries, and affiliates that aggregates to $20 million or more and is shared by three or more unaffiliated supervised institutions. Many of these loan commitments are also shared with FBOs and nonbanks, including securitization pools, hedge funds, insurance companies, and pension funds.In conducting the 2012 SNC Review, agencies reviewed $811 billion of the $2.79 trillion credit commitments in the portfolio. The sample was weighted toward noninvestment grade and criticized credits. The results of the review are based on analyses prepared in the second quarter of 2012 using credit-related data provided by federally supervised institutions as of December 31, 2011, and March 31, 2012.Attachments"

430,8/15/2012,"Agencies Issue Proposed Rule on Appraisals for Higher-Risk MortgagesSix federal financial regulatory agencies today issued a proposed rule to establish new appraisal requirements for ""higher-risk mortgage loans."" The proposed rule would implement amendments to the Truth in Lending Act enacted by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, mortgage loans are higher-risk if they are secured by a consumer's home and have interest rates above a certain threshold.For higher-risk mortgage loans, the proposed rule would require creditors to use a licensed or certified appraiser who prepares a written report based on a physical inspection of the interior of the property. The proposed rule also would require creditors to disclose to applicants information about the purpose of the appraisal and provide consumers with a free copy of any appraisal report.Creditors would have to obtain an additional appraisal at no cost to the consumer for a home-purchase higher-risk mortgage loan if the seller acquired the property for a lower price during the past six months. This requirement would address fraudulent property flipping by seeking to ensure that the value of the property being used as collateral for the loan legitimately increased.The proposed rule is being issued by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the National Credit Union Administration, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.The Federal Register notice is attached. The agencies are seeking comments from the public on all aspects of the proposal. The public will have 60 days, or until October 15, 2012, to review and comment on most of the proposal. However, comments related to the proposed Paperwork Reduction Act analysis will be due 60 days after the rule is published in the Federal Register.

434,8/7/2012,"The Federal Reserve Board on Tuesday announced the issuance of monetary sanctions totaling $3.2 million against MetLife, Inc. for failure to adequately oversee its subsidiary bank's mortgage loan servicing and foreclosure processing operations.  The oversight deficiencies represented unsafe and unsound practices at MetLife and corrective measures were required by a formal enforcement action issued against the company on April 13, 2011.The $3.2 million assessed against MetLife takes into account the maximum amount prescribed for unsafe and unsound practices under the applicable statutory limits, the comparative severity of MetLife's misconduct, and the comparative size of MetLife's foreclosure activities.The April 2011 action against MetLife was among 14 corrective actions issued against large mortgage servicers or their parent holding companies for unsafe and unsound processes and practices in residential mortgage loans servicing and foreclosure processing.  Those deficiencies were identified by examiners during reviews conducted from November 2010 to January 2011.The Board's assessment order against MetLife contains similar terms to those in the assessment orders issued by the Board in February 2012 imposing monetary sanctions against five other mortgage servicing organizations.  The Board's assessments against these five organizations were issued in conjunction with a comprehensive settlement agreement between the organizations and the state attorneys general and the U.S. Department of Justice requiring the organizations to provide payments and designated types of monetary assistance and remediation to residential mortgage borrowers.  Although MetLife was not a party to the settlement in February, the Board's monetary sanctions against MetLife contemplate the possibility of a similar settlement under which MetLife agrees to provide borrower assistance or remediation.In particular, if by June 30, 2013, MetLife enters into a settlement with the attorneys general and Justice Department similar to the February agreement, MetLife must pay the Board the amount not expended by MetLife within two years of its agreement for borrower assistance or remediation in compliance with the settlement agreement. If there is no settlement agreement by June 30, 2013, MetLife will be required to pay to the Board the portion of the $3.2 million that it has not expended by August 6, 2014, on funding to nonprofit organizations for counseling to borrowers who are facing default or foreclosure, or in connection with the independent foreclosure reviews required by the April 2011 enforcement actions.The Federal Reserve will closely monitor expenditures on borrower assistance and remediation and the counseling program and compliance by MetLife with the requirements of the monetary sanctions issued by the Board. Any money paid by MetLife to the Board will be remitted to the U.S. Treasury.The Board is taking action against MetLife at this time in light of MetLife's publicly announced decision to sell its subsidiary bank's deposit-taking operations.  Because that sale is subject to formal approval by regulators other than the Board and would result in MetLife no longer being a bank holding company, the Board believes it is appropriate to act at this time.The Board continues to believe that monetary sanctions in the remaining cases are appropriate and plans to announce monetary penalties against those organizations.For media inquiries, call 202-452-2955"
435,8/2/2012,"Borrowers seeking a review of their mortgage foreclosures under the federal banking agencies' Independent Foreclosure Review now have until December 31, 2012, to submit their requests.The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve) today announced that the deadline for submitting requests for review under the Independent Foreclosure Review has been extended. The new deadline provides additional time for borrowers to request a review if they believe they suffered financial injury as a result of errors in foreclosure actions on their homes in 2009 or 2010 by one of the servicers covered by enforcement actions issued in April 2011.The deadline extension provides more time to increase awareness about the Independent Foreclosure Review and how eligible borrowers may request a review, and to encourage the broadest participation possible. The agencies will work with the servicers to expand their outreach and marketing efforts through the end of the year to encourage as much participation as possible.As part of enforcement actions issued in April 2011, the agencies required 14 large mortgage servicers to retain independent consultants to conduct a comprehensive review of foreclosure activity in 2009 and 2010 to identify borrowers who may have been financially injured due to errors, misrepresentations, or other deficiencies in the foreclosure process. If the review finds that financial injury occurred, the borrower may receive remediation such as lump-sum payments, suspension or rescission of a foreclosure, a loan modification or other loss mitigation assistance, correction of credit reports, or correction of deficiency amounts and records. Lump-sum payments can range from $500 to, in the most egregious cases, $125,000 plus equity, according to guidance issued by the agencies.Requesting a review does not preclude borrowers from taking other actions related to their foreclosures. A servicer is not permitted to require a borrower to sign a waiver of the borrower's ability to pursue claims against the servicer in order to receive compensation under the Independent Foreclosure Review.There are no costs associated with being included in the review. More information, including how to apply online, is available at http://www.independentforeclosurereview.com"
436,8/1/2012,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in June suggests that economic activity decelerated somewhat over the first half of this year. Growth in employment has been slow in recent months, and the unemployment rate remains elevated. Business fixed investment has continued to advance. Household spending has been rising at a somewhat slower pace than earlier in the year. Despite some further signs of improvement, the housing sector remains depressed. Inflation has declined since earlier this year, mainly reflecting lower prices of crude oil and gasoline, and longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee expects economic growth to remain moderate over coming quarters and then to pick up very gradually. Consequently, the Committee anticipates that the unemployment rate will decline only slowly toward levels that it judges to be consistent with its dual mandate. Furthermore, strains in global financial markets continue to pose significant downside risks to the economic outlook. The Committee anticipates that inflation over the medium term will run at or below the rate that it judges most consistent with its dual mandate.To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate, the Committee expects to maintain a highly accommodative stance for monetary policy. In particular, the Committee decided today to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and currently anticipates that economic conditions--including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run--are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through late 2014.The Committee also decided to continue through the end of the year its program to extend the average maturity of its holdings of securities as announced in June, and it is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities. The Committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments and will provide additional accommodation as needed to promote a stronger economic recovery and sustained improvement in labor market conditions in a context of price stability.Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S. Bernanke, Chairman; William C. Dudley, Vice Chairman; Elizabeth A. Duke; Dennis P. Lockhart; Sandra Pianalto; Jerome H. Powell; Sarah Bloom Raskin; Jeremy C. Stein; Daniel K. Tarullo; John C. Williams; and Janet L. Yellen. Voting against the action was Jeffrey M. Lacker, who preferred to omit the description of the time period over which economic conditions are likely to warrant an exceptionally low level of the federal funds rate."

438,7/30/2012,"The Federal Reserve Board on Monday announced the approval of a final rule establishing risk-management standards for certain financial market utilities (FMUs) designated as systemically important by the Financial Stability Oversight Council. The final rule also establishes requirements for advance notice of proposed material changes to the rules, procedures, or operations of certain designated FMUs. FMUs, such as payment systems, central securities depositories, and central counterparties, provide the infrastructure to clear and settle payments and other financial transactions.The final rule (Regulation HH) implements two provisions of Title VIII of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act). It establishes risk-management standards governing the operations related to the payment, clearing, and settlement activities of designated FMUs, except those registered as clearing agencies with the Securities and Exchange Commission or as derivatives clearing organizations with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The risk-management standards are based on the recognized international standards developed by the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (CPSS) and the Technical Committee of the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) that were in existence at the time of the proposed rulemaking, which were incorporated previously into the Board's Policy on Payment System Risk.1The final rule also establishes requirements for advance notice of proposed material changes to the rules, procedures, or operations of a designated FMU for which the Board is the supervisory agency under Title VIII of the Dodd-Frank Act. The advance notice requirements set the threshold above which a proposed change would be considered material and thus require an advance notice to the Board, and also include provisions on the length of the review period.The final rule is substantively similar to the proposed rulemaking, with two exceptions. The final rule includes a new provision that would allow the Board to waive the application of certain Regulation HH standards to a particular type of designated FMU, where the risks presented by or the design of that designated FMU would make application of certain standards inappropriate. In addition, the Board has revised the illustrative list of changes that do not require an advance notice, in part to include changes to a designated FMU's fees, prices, or other charges.The final rule will be effective on September 14, 2012.

444,12/7/2011,"Agencies Seek Comment on Additional Revisions to the Market Risk Capital RulesThe federal bank regulatory agencies today announced they are seeking comment on a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR) that would amend an earlier NPR announced in December 2010. The initial NPR proposed modifications to the agencies' market risk capital rules for banking organizations with significant trading activities.The amended NPR includes alternative standards of creditworthiness to be used in place of credit ratings to determine the capital requirements for certain debt and securitization positions covered by the market risk capital rules. The proposed creditworthiness standards include the use of country risk classifications published by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development for sovereign positions, company-specific financial information and stock market volatility for corporate debt positions, and a supervisory formula for securitization positions.The earlier NPR was based largely on the revisions to the market risk framework published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision since 2005. However, it did not include aspects of the Basel Committee revisions that rely on credit ratings. Under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, all federal agencies must remove references to, and requirements of, reliance on credit ratings from their regulations and replace them with appropriate alternatives for evaluating creditworthiness. The agencies believe that the capital requirements resulting from the implementation of these alternative standards would be generally consistent with the standards in the Basel Committee's revisions.The agencies expect to publish a final market risk capital rule after consideration of the comments on both NPRs.

The rate on these swap arrangements has been reduced from the U.S. dollar OIS rate plus 100 basis points to the OIS rate plus 50 basis points. In addition, as a contingency measure, the Federal Open Market Committee has agreed to establish similar temporary swap arrangements with these five central banks to provide liquidity in any of their currencies if necessary. Further details on the revised arrangements will be available shortly.U.S. financial institutions currently do not face difficulty obtaining liquidity in short-term funding markets. However, were conditions to deteriorate, the Federal Reserve has a range of tools available to provide an effective liquidity backstop for such institutions and is prepared to use these tools as needed to support financial stability and to promote the extension of credit to U.S. households and businesses.Information on Related Actions Being Taken by Other Central Banks

As a part of the review, known as the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR), the Federal Reserve in 2012 will carry out a supervisory stress test based on the same stress scenario provided to the firms to support its analysis of the adequacy of the firms' capital.The aim of the annual capital plans, which build on the CCAR conducted earlier this year, is to ensure that institutions have robust, forward-looking capital planning processes that account for their unique risks, and to help ensure that institutions have sufficient capital to continue operations throughout times of economic and financial stress. Institutions will be expected to have credible plans that show they have sufficient capital so that they can continue to lend to households and businesses, even under adverse conditions, and are well prepared to meet regulatory capital standards agreed to by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision as they are implemented in the United States. Boards of directors of the institutions will be required each year to review and approve capital plans before submitting them to the Federal Reserve.Under the final rule, the Federal Reserve annually will evaluate institutions' capital adequacy, internal capital adequacy assessment processes, and their plans to make capital distributions, such as dividend payments or stock repurchases. The Federal Reserve will approve dividend increases or other capital distributions only for companies whose capital plans are approved by supervisors and are able to demonstrate sufficient financial strength to operate as successful financial intermediaries under stressed macroeconomic and financial market scenarios, even after making the desired capital distributions.In addition to issuing the final rule, the Federal Reserve Board on Tuesday issued instructions outlining the information the Federal Reserve is seeking from the firms and the analysis the Federal Reserve will do for the CCAR in 2012. There are two sets of instructions: one for the 19 firms that participated in the CCAR in 2011, the other for 12 additional firms with at least $50 billion in assets that have not previously participated in a supervisory stress test exercise. The level of detail and analysis expected in each institution's capital plan will vary based on the company's size, complexity, risk profile, and scope of operations.The instructions include a supervisory stress scenario that will be used by all of the firms and the Federal Reserve to analyze firms' capital needs to withstand such a scenario while continuing to act as a financial intermediary. The supervisory stress scenario is not the Federal Reserve's forecast for the economy, but is designed to represent an outcome that, while unlikely, may occur if the U.S economy were to experience a deep recession while at the same time economic activity in other major economies were also to contract significantly. For the 19 firms that participated in the CCAR in 2011, the Federal Reserve will conduct a supervisory stress test using internally developed models to generate loss estimates and post-stress capital ratios.In addition to the macroeconomic scenario provided by the Federal Reserve, the six largest firms will be required to estimate potential losses stemming from a hypothetical global market shock. The global market shock will be based on market price movements seen during the second half of 2008, a time of significant volatility, with adjustments made to incorporate potential sharp market price movements in European sovereign and financial sectors.Firms' capital adequacy, and their plans to make capital distributions, will be assessed against a number of criteria, including projected performance under the stress scenarios provided by the Federal Reserve and the institutions' internal scenarios. After evaluating the institutions' submissions, the Federal Reserve will publish the results of the supervisory stress tests for each of the 19 institutions including the results of the market shock for the six institutions with large trading operations.Institutions will be required to submit their capital plans by January 9, 2012.The capital planning requirements are consistent with the Federal Reserve's obligations to impose enhanced capital and risk-management standards on large financial firms under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.Attachments:Questions-and-Answers (PDF)

459,11/17/2011,"Agencies Issue Statement to Clarify Supervisory and Enforcement Responsibilities
For Federal Consumer Financial LawsWashington--A statement that explains how the total assets of an insured bank, thrift or credit union will be measured for purposes of determining supervisory and enforcement responsibilities under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was issued today by five federal financial supervisory agencies.Under section 1025 of Dodd-Frank, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has exclusive authority to examine for compliance with federal consumer financial laws and primary authority to enforce those laws for institutions with total assets of more than $10 billion, and their affiliates. Section 1026 confirms that the four prudential regulators--the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the National Credit Union Administration, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency--will retain supervisory and enforcement authority for other institutions. The policy statement issued today clarifies the application of sections 1025 and 1026 by addressing two key matters: the measure to be used to determine asset size and the schedule for making such determinations.The statement explains that a common measure of the asset size of an insured depository institution is the total assets reported in the quarterly Reports of Condition and Income (Call Reports), which banks, thrifts, and insured credit unions are required to file.The statement also explains the need to establish a schedule for determining the size of an institution that avoids unwarranted uncertainty or volatility regarding the identity of an institution's primary supervisor for federal consumer financial laws. Such conditions could both impose increased burden on institutions and interfere with the orderly implementation of the agencies' responsibilities with respect to the federal consumer financial laws. In order to avoid these adverse consequences, the agencies are adapting criteria used for deposit insurance assessment purposes. Accordingly, after an initial asset size determination based on June 30, 2011, data, an institution generally will not be reclassified unless four consecutive quarterly reports indicate that a change in supervisor is warranted."
460,4/6/2011,"The Federal Reserve Board on Wednesday requested comment on a proposed rule to repeal the Board's Regulation Q, which prohibits the payment of interest on demand deposits by institutions that are member banks of the Federal Reserve System.The proposed rule would implement Section 627 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which repeals Section 19(i) of the Federal Reserve Act in its entirety effective July 21, 2011. The repeal of that section of the Federal Reserve Act on that date eliminates the statutory authority under which the Board established Regulation Q.The proposed rule would also repeal the Board's published interpretation of Regulation Q and would remove references to Regulation Q found in the Board's other regulations, interpretations, and commentary.The Board is seeking comment on whether the repeal of Regulation Q is expected to have implications for balance sheets and income of depository institutions, short-term funding markets such as overnight federal funds market, the demand for interest-bearing demand deposits, and competitive burden on smaller depository institutions.Comments on the proposal must be submitted within 30 days from the date of publication in the Federal Register, which is expected shortly.Federal Register notice: HTML | PDF (61 KB)Comments: View"

In crafting the proposed rule, the agencies sought to ensure that the amount of credit risk retained is meaningful, while reducing the potential for the rule to negatively affect the availability and cost of credit to consumers and businesses.The rule is proposed by the Federal Reserve Board, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development. It would provide sponsors with various options for meeting the risk-retention requirements of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Among other things, the options include:As required by the act, the proposal includes descriptions of loans that would not be subject to these requirements, including asset-backed securities that are collateralized exclusively by residential mortgages that qualify as ""qualified residential mortgages"" (QRMs). The proposal would establish a definition for QRMs--incorporating such criteria as borrower credit history, payment terms, and loan-to-value ratio--designed to ensure they are of very high credit quality. The proposed rule also includes investor disclosure requirements regarding material information concerning the sponsor's retained interests in a securitization transaction. The disclosures would provide investors and the agencies with an efficient mechanism to monitor compliance with the risk-retention requirements of the proposed rules.The proposed rule also has a zero percent risk-retention requirement for ABS collateralized exclusively by commercial loans, commercial mortgages, or automobile loans that meet certain underwriting standards. As with QRMs, these underwriting standards are designed to be robust and to ensure that the loans backing the ABS are of very low credit risk.The proposed rule would also recognize that the 100 percent guarantee of principal and interest provided by Fannie Mae (the Federal National Mortgage Association) and Freddie Mac (the Federal Home Mortgage Loan Corporation) meets their risk-retention requirements as sponsors of mortgage-backed securities for as long as they are in conservatorship or receivership with capital support from the U.S. government.The agencies request comments on the proposed rule by June 10, 2011.Federal Register notice: HTML | PDF (1.8 MB)

The proposed rule complements guidance previously issued by the agencies, including guidance on sound incentive compensation policies issued by the banking agencies last year.The agencies are proposing that financial institutions with $1 billion or more in assets be required to have policies and procedures to ensure compliance with the requirements of the rule, and submit an annual report to their federal regulator describing the structure of their incentive compensation arrangements. The agencies are proposing that larger financial institutions, generally those with $50 billion or more in assets, defer at least 50 percent of the incentive compensation of certain officers for at least three years and that the amounts ultimately paid reflect losses or other aspects of performance over time. For purposes of credit unions, large financial institutions would be defined as those with $10 billion or more in assets.

Effective July 21, 2011, the Dodd-Frank Act requires that the protections of the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) and the Consumer Leasing Act (CLA) apply to consumer credit transactions and consumer leases up to $50,000, compared with $25,000 currently.

Currently, consumer loans of more than $25,000 are generally exempt from TILA. However, private education loans and loans secured by real property (such as mortgages) are subject to TILA regardless of the amount of the loan.The CLA requires lessors to provide consumers with disclosures regarding the cost and other terms of personal property leases.

These financial statements are audited annually by an independent auditing firm.Total Reserve Bank assets as of December 31, 2010, were $2.428 trillion, which represents an increase of $193 billion from the previous year. The composition of the balance sheet changed notably. Holdings of U.S. Treasury securities increased $261 billion and holdings of federal agency and government-sponsored enterprise (GSE) mortgage-backed securities (MBS) increased $86 billion. These increases were partly offset by a $96 billion decrease in loans to depository institutions and a $23 billion decrease in loans extended under the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, largely due to early repayments by borrowers.The Reserve Banks' comprehensive income increased $28 billion over the previous year to $82 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of $24 billion in interest earnings on the federal agency and GSE MBS holdings.The Reserve Banks transferred $79 billion of their $82 billion in comprehensive income to the U.S. Treasury in 2010, a $32 billion increase from the amount transferred in 2009.The combined annual financial statements for the Federal Reserve Banks and the consolidated annual financial statements for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York include information about the assets and income of each of the consolidated LLCs, such as overall financial results, portfolio composition, asset quality, and asset value information. The statements also contain summaries of the associated credit and market risks for each significant holding.The consolidated LLCs also contributed to the increase in Reserve Banks' 2010 comprehensive income, with net earnings of $8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010, a $2 billion increase from the 2009 net earnings of $6 billion.The Federal Reserve System financial statements may be accessed via the Federal Reserve Board's website at http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/bst_fedfinancials.htm"
479,3/18/2011,"The Federal Reserve Board on Friday approved a rule amending Regulation Z (Truth in Lending) to clarify aspects of prior Board rules implementing the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 (Credit Card Act). This rule is intended to enhance protections for consumers who use credit cards and to resolve areas of uncertainty so that card issuers fully understand their compliance obligations.In order to protect consumers from incurring unaffordable levels of credit card debt, the Credit Card Act requires that, before opening a new credit card account or increasing the credit limit on an existing account, card issuers consider a consumer's ability to make the required payments on the account. Consistent with the act, the Board's rule addresses practices that can result in extensions of credit to consumers who lack the ability to pay. Specifically, the rule states that credit card applications generally cannot request a consumer's ""household income"" because that term is too vague to allow issuers to properly evaluate the consumer's ability to pay. Instead, issuers must consider the consumer's individual income or salary.In addition, the Board's rule clarifies that:The notice that will be published in the Federal Register is attached.Federal Register notice: HTML | PDF (526 KB)"

492,8/26/2010,"The Federal Reserve System will sponsor a national summit on September 1 and 2 to discuss methods and resources for encouraging neighborhood stabilization in the aftermath of the U.S. home mortgage foreclosure crisis. The forum will showcase findings from Federal Reserve research and policy efforts, including the release of the publication REO and Vacant Properties: Strategies for Neighborhood Stabilization.People living in communities with vacant properties face declining property values, loss of public services due to reduced tax revenue, and increased levels of crime. The summit will examine practical and tested strategies that nonprofit organizations, local and regional governments, federal officials, and lenders can use to mitigate the impact of vacant and real estate owned (REO) property--property held on the books of banks, typically after failure to sell at foreclosure auction.""A foreclosure not only hurts the person who loses their home, it hurts their neighbors and their communities,"" said Federal Reserve Governor Elizabeth A. Duke. ""As delinquencies and foreclosures continue to increase, we must think creatively and focus our research, outreach, and community development efforts on ways to help these communities recover.""Summit speakers include Governor Duke; U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan; Federal Reserve Bank Presidents Charles Evans (Chicago), Sandra Pianalto (Cleveland), and Eric Rosengren (Boston); and representatives of various sectors involved in the foreclosure process and community stabilization efforts. Live video of the event will be available online at: http://www.ustream.tv/channel/federalreserve.The summit and its accompanying publication build upon a series of Federal Reserve System actions to address the foreclosure crisis on a national and community level. These actions range from facilitating foreclosure counseling to providing research and data analysis of REO trends. The Reserve Banks will carry forward this work by offering technical assistance and expertise to local nonprofit organizations and governments.Many conference participants are also contributors to the summit publication REO and Vacant Properties: Strategies for Neighborhood Stabilization, which contains 17 articles that examine a variety of neighborhood stabilization issues. The collection highlights both areas of need--such as for data, technology, and collaboration--and promising solutions, such as the Cuyahoga County, Ohio, land bank that holds vacant properties until they can be returned to productive use, and Boston Community Capital's efforts to purchase foreclosed properties and sell them back to former owners or tenants using a licensed mortgage affiliate.The summit will be held at the Federal Reserve Board in Washington, D.C.

525,12/16/2009,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in November suggests that economic activity has continued to pick up and that the deterioration in the labor market is abating. The housing sector has shown some signs of improvement over recent months. Household spending appears to be expanding at a moderate rate, though it remains constrained by a weak labor market, modest income growth, lower housing wealth, and tight credit. Businesses are still cutting back on fixed investment, though at a slower pace, and remain reluctant to add to payrolls; they continue to make progress in bringing inventory stocks into better alignment with sales. Financial market conditions have become more supportive of economic growth. Although economic activity is likely to remain weak for a time, the Committee anticipates that policy actions to stabilize financial markets and institutions, fiscal and monetary stimulus, and market forces will contribute to a strengthening of economic growth and a gradual return to higher levels of resource utilization in a context of price stability.With substantial resource slack likely to continue to dampen cost pressures and with longer-term inflation expectations stable, the Committee expects that inflation will remain subdued for some time.The Committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and continues to anticipate that economic conditions, including low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations, are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period. To provide support to mortgage lending and housing markets and to improve overall conditions in private credit markets, the Federal Reserve is in the process of purchasing $1.25 trillion of agency mortgage-backed securities and about $175 billion of agency debt. In order to promote a smooth transition in markets, the Committee is gradually slowing the pace of these purchases, and it anticipates that these transactions will be executed by the end of the first quarter of 2010. The Committee will continue to evaluate the timing and overall amounts of its purchases of securities in light of the evolving economic outlook and conditions in financial markets.In light of ongoing improvements in the functioning of financial markets, the Committee and the Board of Governors anticipate that most of the Federal Reserve’s special liquidity facilities will expire on February 1, 2010, consistent with the Federal Reserve’s announcement of June 25, 2009. These facilities include the Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility, the Commercial Paper Funding Facility, the Primary Dealer Credit Facility, and the Term Securities Lending Facility. The Federal Reserve will also be working with its central bank counterparties to close its temporary liquidity swap arrangements by February 1. The Federal Reserve expects that amounts provided under the Term Auction Facility will continue to be scaled back in early 2010. The anticipated expiration dates for the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility remain set at June 30, 2010, for loans backed by new-issue commercial mortgage-backed securities and March 31, 2010, for loans backed by all other types of collateral. The Federal Reserve is prepared to modify these plans if necessary to support financial stability and economic growth.Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S. Bernanke, Chairman; William C. Dudley, Vice Chairman; Elizabeth A. Duke; Charles L. Evans; Donald L. Kohn; Jeffrey M. Lacker; Dennis P. Lockhart; Daniel K. Tarullo; Kevin M. Warsh; and Janet L.

The set of NRSROs that become eligible under the new criteria will take effect with the February 2010 TALF subscription.The TALF, authorized by the Board on November 24, 2008, helps market participants meet the credit needs of households and businesses by lending to investors in highly rated ABS and commercial mortgage-backed securities.The Federal Register notice is attached.Federal Register notice: HTML | 57 KB PDFTALF Frequently Asked Questions"

Additional disclosures must be provided when the loan is approved and when the loan is consummated. The Board is also providing model disclosure forms that creditors could use to comply with the new disclosure requirements.The new disclosure requirements apply to loans made expressly for postsecondary educational expenses but do not apply where educational expenses are funded by credit card advances, or real-estate-secured loans. In addition, the amendments do not apply to education loans made, insured, or guaranteed by the federal government, which are subject to disclosure rules issued by the Department of Education.The Board's amendments also implement the HEOA's restrictions on using the name, emblem, or mascot of an educational institution in a way that implies that the institution endorses the creditor's loans.The mandatory effective date for the amendments is 180 days after publication in the Federal Register, which is expected shortly.Federal Register notice: HTML | 4.36 MB PDFConsumer Research and Testing for Private Education Loans: Final Report of Findings (8.9 MB PDF)Model forms and samples:"

The publication recommends taking the time do some comparison shopping by analyzing loan offers from mortgage lenders and mortgage brokers. It also explains the difference between brokers and lenders--mortgage brokers arrange mortgage loans with lenders, while mortgage lenders lend money directly. ""5 Tips"" explains that learning about the risks and benefits of various types of mortgage loans is critical to obtaining and sustaining the right mortgage for a family's budget.The guide advises consumers to take advantage of additional information from other Federal Reserve publications, resources, and websites.

Normally, the SCF is undertaken on a purely cross-sectional basis every three years. But given the serious financial and economic problems of the past two years, this special study will gather a detailed picture of the effects of those events on households and their finances.The SCF will be conducted for the Board by the National Opinion Research Center (NORC), a social science research organization at the University of Chicago. Data will be collected from July 25 through December 31 of this year.""It may seem that everything that needs to be known about recent economic changes is already known,"" Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said in a letter to potential respondents. ""But, we would benefit from a more detailed understanding of what has happened across the broad range of types of households. For that, we need to look directly at changes for individual households.""The 2009 survey will attempt to secure interviews with all 4,422 participants in the 2007 SCF who are living in the United States. Because the re-interview will cover most of the topics included in the 2007 survey, it will be possible to look directly at changes in household finances. In addition, the re-interview will explore several topics particularly relevant for the time since the 2007 survey, including issues related to credit constraints, small business performance, housing, mortgages, and expectations about the future for the economy in general and aspects of the household's finances in particular.The re-interview will provide a representative picture of changes for U.S. households that were in existence two years ago. The original sample was chosen at random from 79 areas, including metropolitan areas and rural counties across the United States, using a scientific sampling procedure. A representative of NORC will contact each potential participant personally to explain the study and request time for an interview.The attached letter from Chairman Bernanke was mailed to the sample households urging their participation in the re-interview study. ""I assure you that we give the highest priority to guarding the privacy of the survey participants and the confidentiality of their answers,"" Chairman Bernanke wrote. NORC uses names and addresses only for the administration of the survey. No one at the Federal Reserve is permitted to see the names of the participants.Summary results from the 2009 re-interview are expected to be available late next year after all data from the survey have been assessed and analyzed.

Bernanke. ""It is often said that a home is a family's most important asset, and it is the Federal Reserve's responsibility to see that borrowers receive the information they need to protect that asset.""To shop for and understand the cost of credit, consumers must be able to identify and understand the key terms of the mortgage. In formulating the proposed revisions to Regulation Z, the Board used consumer testing to ensure that the most essential information is provided at a suitable time using content and formats that are clear and conspicuous.""Our goal is to ensure that consumers receive the information they need, whether they are applying for a fixed-rate mortgage with level payments for 30 years, or an adjustable-rate mortgage with low initial payments that can increase sharply,"" said Governor Elizabeth A. Duke. ""With this in mind, the disclosures would be revised to highlight potentially risky features such as adjustable rates, prepayment penalties, and negative amortization.""Closed-end mortgage disclosures would be revised to highlight potentially risky features such as adjustable rates, prepayment penalties, and negative amortization. The Board's proposal would:The Board will also work with the Department of Housing and Urban Development to make the disclosures mandated by TILA, and HUD's disclosures, required by the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, complementary; potentially developing a single disclosure form that creditors could use to satisfy both laws.In developing the proposed amendments, the Board recognized that disclosures alone may not always be sufficient to protect consumers from unfair practices. To prevent mortgage loan originators from ""steering"" consumers to more expensive loans, the Board's proposal would:The rules for home-equity lines of credit would be revised to change the timing, content, and format of the disclosures that creditors provide to consumers at application and throughout the life of such accounts. Currently, consumers receive lengthy, generic disclosures at application. Under the proposal, consumers would receive a new one-page Board publication summarizing basic information and risks regarding HELOCs at application. Shortly after application, consumers would receive new disclosures that reflect the specific terms of their credit plans. In addition, the Board's proposal would:The Federal Register notices are attached.

562,3/11/2009,"The Federal Reserve Board on Wednesday proposed amendments to Regulation Z (Truth in Lending) that would revise the disclosure requirements for private education loans.The amendments implement provisions of the Higher Education Opportunity Act (HEOA), which was signed into law on August 14, 2008.  Under the amendments, creditors that extend private education loans would provide disclosures about loan terms and features on or with the loan application and would also have to disclose information about federal student loan programs that may offer less costly alternatives.  Additional disclosures would have to be provided when the loan is approved and when the loan is consummated.  The Board is also proposing model disclosure forms that creditors could use to comply with the new disclosure requirements.The new disclosure requirements would apply to loans made expressly for postsecondary educational expenses but would not apply where educational expenses are funded by credit card advances, or real-estate-secured loans.  In addition, the proposal does not apply to education loans made, insured, or guaranteed by the federal government, which are subject to disclosure rules issued by the Department of Education.The Board's proposal also implements the HEOA's restrictions on using the name, emblem, or mascot of an educational institution in a way that implies that the institution endorses the creditor's loans.The public comment period ends 60 days after publication of the proposed amendments in the Federal Register, which is expected shortly.The Board's notice is attached.Federal Register notice: 1.42 MB PDF | HTMLModel forms and samples:Consumer Research and Testing for Private Education Loans (9.3 MB PDF)"

570,3/5/2009,"Reports of mortgage foreclosure scams are on the rise.  Knowing what to watch for and where to turn for help is vital for families who are struggling to remain in their homes.  March 1 to 9 is National Consumer Protection Week, and the Federal Reserve Board has compiled some tips to help protect consumers from becoming victims of foreclosure avoidance scams.  It's important for consumers to know that housing counselors and other resources are available at no or low cost to assist homeowners who have fallen behind on their mortgage payments. 
""Saving a home from foreclosure requires fast and informed action but the solution doesn't have to be costly,"" said Federal Reserve Governor Elizabeth A Duke.  ""It shouldn't hurt to get help.""
Solicitors of foreclosure schemes reach out to potential victims by a variety of means using the Internet, the telephone, and direct mailings.  Some solicitors go door-to-door or approach homeowners at events related to home preservation.  The information the Federal Reserve is providing, which is part of its ""5 Tips"" series, is intended to give consumers the basic information they need to recognize and avoid foreclosure avoidance scams.  Consumers are urged to check the credentials of counselors and to avoid working with someone who collects a fee before providing any services or accepts payment only by cashier's check or wire transfer.  Consumers should not pay for a service without knowing exactly what they are buying.
Avoiding foreclosure cannot be guaranteed--regardless of the circumstances.  Working with a legitimate counselor can increase the chances of keeping a home, but consumers should be wary of people who tell them it's a sure thing.  Details of the transaction, along with any promises, should be provided up front and in writing.
The tips to follow will help consumers select a reputable counselor and avoid fraudulent foreclosure scams.


Work only with a non-profit HUD-approved counselor.  For a list of certified counselors visit www.hud.gov/offices/hsg/sfh/hcc/hcs.cfm or call 877-HUD-1515 (877-483-1515).  If the name of the organization you are working with isn't on the list, then switch to one that is. 

Don't pay an arm and a leg.  Most housing counselors provide no- or low-cost counseling services.  You should not have to pay hundreds, or thousands, of dollars for assistance.

Be wary of ""guarantees.""  No one can ensure you good results. 
Know what you are signing. Don't let a counselor pressure you into signing paperwork you haven't had a chance to read thoroughly or that you don't understand. 


If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.

If you feel you are a victim of foreclosure fraud, trust your instincts and ask for help. Report suspicious schemes to your state and local consumer protection agencies, which you can find on the Consumer Action Website.

572,3/4/2009,"The federal bank, thrift, and credit union regulatory agencies encourage all federally regulated financial institutions that service or hold residential mortgage loans to participate in the ""Making Home Affordable"" loan modification program.  Guidelines for the program were announced today by the Treasury Department.The Treasury Department previously has indicated that institutions receiving financial assistance in the future under the Financial Stability Plan established under the Troubled Assets Relief Program will be required to implement loan modification programs in accordance with the Treasury Department's guidelines.The agencies strongly support the program's goal of promoting sustainable loan modifications for at-risk homeowners that appropriately balance the interests of homeowners, servicers, and investors.  The federal bank, thrift, and credit union regulatory agencies worked closely with the Treasury Department in developing the guidelines.By providing servicers and holders of eligible residential mortgages with incentives to modify loans at risk of foreclosure, the program will promote sustainable alternatives to foreclosures on owner-occupied residential properties. These incentives should help make affordable loan modifications more attractive than foreclosure.  The program also provides incentives for homeowners whose mortgages are modified to remain current on their mortgages after modification.  Taken together, these incentives should help responsible homeowners remain in their homes and avoid foreclosure, thereby easing downward pressures on house prices in many parts of the country and averting the costs to families, communities, and the economy from avoidable foreclosures.Related Press Release:Relief for Responsible Homeowners One Step Closer Under New Treasury GuidelinesU.S. Department of the Treasury"
573,3/3/2009,"In carrying out the Financial Stability Plan, the Department of the Treasury and the Federal Reserve Board are announcing the launch of the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF), a component of the Consumer and Business Lending Initiative (CBLI).  The TALF has the potential to generate up to $1 trillion of lending for businesses and households.The TALF is designed to catalyze the securitization markets by providing financing to investors to support their purchases of certain AAA-rated asset-backed securities (ABS).  These markets have historically been a critical component of lending in our financial system, but they have been virtually shuttered since the worsening of the financial crisis in October.  By reopening these markets, the TALF will assist lenders in meeting the borrowing needs of consumers and small businesses, helping to stimulate the broader economy.Under today's announcement, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York will lend up to $200 billion to eligible owners of certain AAA-rated ABS backed by newly and recently originated auto loans, credit card loans, student loans, and SBA-guaranteed small business loans.  Issuers and investors in the private sector are expected to begin arranging and marketing new securitizations of recently generated loans, and subscriptions for funding in March will be accepted on March 17, 2009.  On March 25, 2009, those new securitizations will be funded by the program, creating new lending capacity for additional future loans.The program will hold monthly fundings through December 2009 or longer if the Federal Reserve Board chooses to extend the facility.Today the Board also released revised terms and conditions for the facility and a revised set of frequently asked questions.  The revisions include a reduction in the interest rates and collateral haircuts for loans secured by asset-backed securities guaranteed by the Small Business Administration or backed by government-guaranteed student loans.  The modifications are warranted by the minimal credit risk on these assets owing to the government guarantees, and, by making the terms of the TALF loans more attractive, they should encourage greater flows of credit to small businesses and students.Additional details of the TALF and the CBLI can be found at http://www.financialstability.gov/.  Further information on the Federal Reserve's credit and liquidity programs is available at http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/bst.htm.  The Treasury Department also released a new white paper outlining efforts to unlock credit markets. On February 10, 2009, the Board and Treasury announced an expansion of TALF to include new asset categories that could generate up to $1 trillion in new lending.  Teams from the Treasury Department and Federal Reserve are analyzing the appropriate terms and conditions for accepting commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) and are evaluating a number of other types of AAA-rated newly issued ABS for possible acceptance under the expanded program.  The expanded program will remain focused on securities that will have the greatest macroeconomic impact and can most efficiently be added to the TALF at a low and manageable risk to the government.The Federal Reserve and Treasury currently anticipate that ABS backed by rental, commercial, and government vehicle fleet leases, and ABS backed by small ticket equipment, heavy equipment, and agricultural equipment loans and leases will be eligible for the April funding of the TALF.  Other types of securities under consideration include private-label residential mortgage-backed securities, collateralized loan and debt obligations, and other ABS not included in the initial rollout such as ABS backed by non-auto floorplan loans and ABS backed by mortgage-servicer advances.  As is the case for the current categories of newly originated loans, the TALF will combine public financing with private capital to encourage the private securitization of loans in the asset classes eligible in the expanded program.Increased TALF lending and other actions to stabilize the financial system have the potential to greatly expand the Federal Reserve's balance sheet.  In order for the Federal Reserve to conduct monetary policy over time in a way consistent with maximum sustainable employment and price stability, it must be able to manage its balance sheet, and in particular, to control the amount of reserves that the Federal Reserve provides to the banking system.  The amount of reserves is the key determinant of the interest rate that the Federal Reserve uses to pursue its monetary policy objectives.  Treasury and the Federal Reserve will seek legislation to give the Federal Reserve the additional tools it will need to enable it to manage the level of reserves while providing the funding necessary for the TALF and for other key credit-easing programs.Key Dates for the TALF

Federal Reserve Bank of New York announces March 17 TALF Operation"
574,3/2/2009,"Washington, D.C. -- The U.S. Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve Board today announced a restructuring of the government's assistance to AIG in order to stabilize this systemically important company in a manner that best protects the U.S. taxpayer. Specifically, the government's restructuring is designed to enhance the company's capital and liquidity in order to facilitate the orderly completion of the company's global divestiture program.The company continues to face significant challenges, driven by the rapid deterioration in certain financial markets in the last two months of the year and continued turbulence in the markets generally. The additional resources will help stabilize the company, and in doing so help to stabilize the financial system.As significantly, the restructuring components of the government's assistance begin to separate the major non-core businesses of AIG, as well as strengthen the company's finances. The long-term solution for the company, its customers, the U.S. taxpayer, and the financial system is the orderly restructuring and refocusing of the firm. This will take time and possibly further government support, if markets do not stabilize and improve.Given the systemic risk AIG continues to pose and the fragility of markets today, the potential cost to the economy and the taxpayer of government inaction would be extremely high. AIG provides insurance protection to more than 100,000 entities, including small businesses, municipalities, 401(k) plans, and Fortune 500 companies who together employ over 100 million Americans. AIG has over 30 million policyholders in the U.S. and is a major source of retirement insurance for, among others, teachers and non-profit organizations. The company also is a significant counterparty to a number of major financial institutions.AIG operates in over 130 countries with over 400 regulators and the company and its regulated and unregulated subsidiaries are subject to very different resolution frameworks across their broad and diverse operations without an overarching resolution mechanism. Within the options available, the restructuring plan offers a multi-part approach which brings forward the ultimate resolution of the company, has received support from key stakeholders and the rating agencies, and provides the best possible protection for taxpayers in connection with this commitment of resources.The steps announced today provide tangible evidence of the U.S. government's commitment to the orderly restructuring of AIG over time in the face of continuing market dislocations and economic deterioration. Orderly restructuring is essential to AIG's repayment of the support it has received from U.S. taxpayers and to preserving financial stability. The U.S. government is committed to continuing to work with AIG to maintain its ability to meet its obligations as they come due.Treasury has stated that public ownership of financial institutions is not a policy goal and, to the extent public ownership is an outcome of Treasury actions, as it has been with AIG, it will work to replace government resources with those from the private sector to create a more focused, restructured, and viable economic entity as rapidly as possible. This restructuring is aimed at accelerating this process. Key steps of the restructuring plan include:Preferred Equity The U.S. Treasury will exchange its existing $40 billion cumulative perpetual preferred shares for new preferred shares with revised terms that more closely resemble common equity and thus improve the quality of AIG's equity and its financial leverage. The new terms will provide for non-cumulative dividends and limit AIG's ability to redeem the preferred stock except with the proceeds from the issuance of equity capital.Equity Capital CommitmentThe Treasury Department will create a new equity capital facility, which allows AIG to draw down up to $30 billion as needed over time in exchange for non-cumulative preferred stock to the U.S. Treasury. This facility will further strengthen AIG's capital levels and improve its leverage.Federal Reserve Revolving Credit FacilityThe Federal Reserve will take several actions relating to the $60 billion Revolving Credit Facility for AIG established by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (New York Fed) in September 2008, to further the goals described above.Repayment by Preferred Stock Interests The Revolving Credit Facility will be reduced in exchange for preferred interests in two special purpose vehicles created to hold all of the outstanding common stock of American Life Insurance Company (ALICO) and American International Assurance Company Ltd. (AIA), two life insurance holding company subsidiaries of AIG. AIG will retain control of ALICO and AIA, though the New York Fed will have certain governance rights to protect its interests. The valuation for the New York Fed's preferred stock interests, which may be up to approximately $26 billion, will be a percentage of the fair market value of ALICO and AIA based on valuations acceptable to the New York Fed.Securitization of Life Insurance Cash Flows The New York Fed is authorized to make new loans under section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act of up to an aggregate amount of approximately $8.5 billion to special purpose vehicles (SPVs) established by domestic life insurance subsidiaries of AIG. The SPVs would repay the loans from the net cash flows they receive from designated blocks of existing life insurance policies held by the parent insurance companies. The proceeds of the New York Fed loans would pay down an equivalent amount of outstanding debt under the Revolving Credit Facility. The amounts lent, the size of the haircuts taken by the New York Fed, and other terms of the loans would be determined based on valuations acceptable to the New York Fed.Restructuring of Other TermsAfter the transactions described above, the total amount available under the Facility will be reduced from $60 billion to no less than $25 billion. In addition, the interest rate on the Facility, which is three-month LIBOR plus 300 basis points, will be modified by removing the existing floor (3.5 percent) on the LIBOR rate. The Facility will continue to be secured by a lien on a substantial portion of AIG's assets, including the businesses AIG plans to retain. The other material terms of the Facility remain unchanged.Issuance of Preferred StockAs required by the credit agreement governing the Revolving Credit Facility, AIG has agreed to issue on March 4, 2009, shares of convertible preferred stock representing an approximately 77.9% equity interest in AIG to an independent trust for the sole benefit of the United States Treasury.AIG must be in compliance with the executive compensation and corporate governance requirements of Section 111 of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, including the most stringent limitations on executive compensation as required under the newest amendments to the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act. Additionally, AIG must continue to maintain and enforce newly adopted restrictions put in place by the new management on corporate expenses and lobbying as well as corporate governance requirements."

580,10/20/2008,"The Federal Reserve Board on Monday approved final amendments to Regulation C that revise the rules for reporting price information on higher-priced mortgage loans.  The changes are intended to improve the accuracy and usefulness of data reported under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act.Regulation C currently requires lenders to collect and report the spread between the annual percentage rate (APR) on a mortgage loan and the yield on a Treasury security of comparable maturity if the spread is greater than 3.0 percentage points for a first lien loan or greater than 5.0 percentage points for a subordinate lien loan.  This difference is known as a rate spread. Under the final rule, a lender will report the spread between the loan's APR and a survey-based estimate of APRs currently offered on prime mortgages of a comparable type (""average prime offer rate"") if the spread is equal to or greater than 1.5 percentage points for a first lien loan or equal to or greater than 3.5 percentage points for a subordinate-lien loan.  The Board will publish average prime offer rates based on the Primary Mortgage Market Survey® currently published by Freddie Mac.  The Board will conduct its own survey if it becomes appropriate or necessary to do so.In setting the rate spread reporting threshold, the Board sought to cover subprime mortgages and generally avoid covering prime mortgages.  Applying the new, market survey-based benchmarks in place of Treasury security yields should better achieve this purpose and ensure more consistent and more useful data.The changes to Regulation C conform the threshold for rate spread reporting to the definition of higher-priced mortgage loans adopted by the Board under Regulation Z (Truth in Lending) in July of 2008.  By implementing the same pricing threshold test under both regulations, the Board is reducing the overall regulatory burden on mortgage lenders.The final rule is effective October 1, 2009.   The Board's Federal Register notice is attached.Federal Register notice: 89 KB PDF | HTML"
581,10/20/2008,"The federal banking and thrift regulatory agencies encourage all eligible institutions to use the Treasury Department's Capital Purchase Program and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program.  On October 14, 2008, the U.S. government announced a series of initiatives to strengthen market stability, improve the strength of financial institutions, and enhance market liquidity.  Treasury announced a voluntary Capital Purchase Program to encourage U.S. financial institutions to build capital to increase the flow of financing to U.S. businesses and consumers and to support the U.S. economy.  Under the program, Treasury will purchase up to $250 billion of senior preferred shares on standardized terms.Treasury's Capital Purchase Program and the FDIC's Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program complement one another.  Through these programs, fresh capital and liquidity are available to foster new lending in our nation's communities.Under Treasury's Capital Purchase Program, eligible institutions will be able to sell equity interests to Treasury in amounts equal to 1 percent to 3 percent of the institution's risk-weighted assets.  These equity interests will constitute Tier 1 capital for the eligible institution.Treasury and the agencies on Monday issued application guidelines and other documents for the Capital Purchase Program.  Those documents are attached.  If regulated by the Federal Reserve, contact your local Reserve Bank about the program.  If regulated by the FDIC, contact the appropriate regional office for your institution.  If regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, contact Fred Finke ([email protected]) for more information and send applications to [email protected] or OCC Director of Licensing, 250 E St. SW, Mail Stop 7-13, Washington DC, 20219-0001.  If regulated by the Office of Thrift Supervision, contact the appropriate regional office for your institution.Nine large financial organizations already have agreed to participate in the Capital Purchase Program.  We encourage other institutions to take advantage of the benefits of the Capital Purchase Program by contacting their primary federal regulator and appropriate bank holding company regulator if applicable for details about the program, conditions, and eligibility.  The deadline to apply is November 14, 2008.All eligible institutions are automatically covered by the FDIC's Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program without charge for the first 30 days.  The Treasury's Capital Purchase Program and FDIC’s Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program share a common goal--to restore capital flows to the consumers and businesses that form the core of our economy.  The federal bank and thrift regulatory agencies encourage eligible institutions to participate in that common goal.Attachments:

583,10/17/2008,"The federal banking and thrift regulatory agencies announced today that they will allow banks, bank holding companies, and thrifts (collectively, ""banking organizations"") to recognize the effect of the tax change enacted in Section 301 of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (EESA) in their third quarter 2008 regulatory capital calculations.Section 301 of EESA provides tax relief to banking organizations that have suffered losses on certain holdings of Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) preferred stock by changing the character of these losses from capital to ordinary for federal income tax purposes.  However, because the EESA was not enacted until October 3, 2008, banking organizations will not be able to recognize the tax effects of the ordinary losses resulting from Section 301 of EESA in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles until the fourth quarter of 2008.  Today's decision by the agencies will allow banking organizations to recognize the economic benefits of the change in the tax treatment of losses on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac preferred stock under Section 301 of the EESA in the third quarter of 2008 for regulatory capital purposes.The agencies plan to provide regulatory reporting instructions to banking organizations describing how the effect of the tax change enacted in Section 301 of EESA should be reflected in the measurement of regulatory capital in their regulatory reports for September 30, 2008."

585,10/16/2008,"The Federal Reserve on Thursday issued enhanced guidance that refines and clarifies its programs for the consolidated supervision of bank holding companies and the combined U.S. operations of foreign banking organizations (FBOs). The Federal Reserve also released guidance clarifying supervisory expectations with respect to firmwide compliance risk management.While initiation of these efforts predated the recent period of considerable strain in the financial markets, these enhanced approaches to consolidated supervision and firmwide compliance risk management emphasize several elements that should support a more resilient financial system.The Federal Reserve continues to work, both independently and in conjunction with other supervisors and functional regulators, on a number of initiatives to strengthen supervisory approaches and reinforce expectations for sound practices in response to market events.""This supervisory guidance on consolidated supervision and compliance risk management will better equip our supervisory staff, working closely with other U.S. and foreign supervisors and regulators, to understand and assess the full range and scope of a banking organization's operations and risks,"" said Federal Reserve Board Governor Randall S. Kroszner.""This guidance should not only provide greater clarity regarding our longstanding responsibilities as a consolidated supervisor, but is also responsive to ongoing developments in the financial sector. The objectives of fostering financial stability and deterring or managing financial crises will be furthered by the Federal Reserve having a more complete view of firmwide risks and controls,"" Governor Kroszner said.The continuing growth in the size and complexity of many banking organizations exposes these firms to a wide array of potential risks, while at the same time making it more challenging for a single supervisor to have a comprehensive perspective on the firm as a whole. In this regard, the consolidated supervision guidance is designed to foster consistent Federal Reserve supervisory practices and assessments across institutions with similar activities and risks.The guidance describes how Federal Reserve staff develops an understanding and assessment of the consolidated operations of a bank holding company and the U.S. operations of an FBO through continuous monitoring activities, discovery reviews, and testing activities, as well as through interaction with, and reliance to the fullest extent possible on, other relevant supervisors and functional regulators.The separate compliance risk management guidance endorses the principles set forth in the April 2005 paper issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision entitled Compliance and the compliance function in banks. This guidance clarifies certain Federal Reserve supervisory policies regarding compliance risk management programs and oversight at large banking organizations with complex compliance profiles.The supervisory guidance on both consolidated supervision and compliance risk management is attached.SR Letter 08-8/CA Letter 08-11SR Letter 08-9/CA Letter 08-12"

593,10/14/2008,"Washington, DC-- The following statement was made by Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson, Jr, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and FDIC Chairman Sheila C. Bair:Today we are taking decisive actions to protect the U.S. economy, to strengthen public confidence in our financial institutions, and to foster the robust functioning of our credit markets. These steps will ensure that the U.S. financial system performs its vital role of providing credit to households and businesses and protecting savings and investments in a manner that promotes strong economic growth in the U.S. and around the world. The overwhelming majority of banks in the United States are strong and well-capitalized.  These actions will bolster public confidence in our system to restore and stabilize liquidity necessary to support economic growth.Last week, the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets announced that the U.S. government would deploy all of our tools in a strategic and collaborative manner to address the current instability in our financial markets and mitigate the risks that instability poses for broader economic growth. This past weekend, we and our G7 colleagues committed to a comprehensive global strategy to provide liquidity to markets, to strengthen financial institutions, to prevent failures that pose systemic risk, to protect savers, and to enforce investor protections.We welcomed the steps announced by our European colleagues this weekend to implement the action plan, and ensure financial institutions in Europe can finance economic growth.  Today we are implementing our strategy with three important actions.First, Treasury is announcing a voluntary capital purchase program. A broad array of financial institutions is eligible to participate in this program by selling preferred shares to the U.S. government on attractive terms that protect the taxpayer. Second, after receiving a recommendation from the boards of the FDIC and the Federal Reserve, and consulting with the President, Secretary Paulson signed the systemic risk exception to the FDIC Act, enabling the FDIC to temporarily guarantee the senior debt of all FDIC-insured institutions and their holding companies, as well as deposits in non-interest bearing deposit transaction accounts. Regulators will implement an enhanced supervisory framework to assure appropriate use of this new guarantee.We are pleased to announce that nine major financial institutions have already agreed to participate in both the capital purchase program and the FDIC guarantee program. We appreciate that these healthy institutions are taking these steps to strengthen their own positions and to enhance the overall performance of the U.S. economy. By participating in these programs, these institutions, along with thousands of others to come, will have enhanced capacity to perform their vital function of lending to U.S. consumers and businesses and promoting economic growth. They have also committed to continued aggressive actions to prevent unnecessary foreclosures and preserve homeownership.Third, to further increase access to funding for businesses in all sectors of our economy, the Federal Reserve has announced further details of its Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF) program, which provides a broad backstop for the commercial paper market. Beginning October 27, the CPFF will fund purchases of commercial paper of 3 month maturity from high-quality issuers.Together these three steps significantly strengthen the capital position and funding ability of U.S. financial institutions, enabling them to perform their role of underpinning overall economic growth. These actions demonstrate to market participants here and around the world the strength of the U.S. government’s commitment to take all necessary steps to unlock our credit markets and minimize the impact of the current instability on the overall U.S. economy. The actions taken today are a powerful step toward restoring the health of the global financial system.Remarks by Chairman Ben S. Bernanke at the President’s Working Group Market Stability Initiative announcement"

599,10/8/2008,"The volume of Shared National Credits (SNC),2 loan commitments of $20 million or more and held by three or more federally supervised institutions, rose 22.6 percent to $2.8 trillion, and the volume of criticized credits increased to $373.4 billion, or 13.4 percent of the SNC portfolio, according to the 2008 SNC review results released today by federal bank and thrift regulators. The results of the review--reported by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of Thrift Supervision--are based on analyses prepared in the second quarter of 2008 of credit data provided by federally supervised institutions as of December 31, 2007.The record growth in credit volume is concentrated in large syndicated loans that were underwritten in late 2006 and the first half of 2007 led by the Media and Telecom, Utilities, Finance and Insurance, and Oil and Gas industry sectors. The SNC portfolio experienced nominal growth in the last half of 2007.Criticized credits3 increased $259.3 billion and represent 13.4 percent of the SNC portfolio compared with 5.0 percent in the 2007 SNC review. Credits rated special mention (potentially weak credits) increased by $167.9 billion and represent 7.5 percent of the SNC portfolio compared with 1.9 percent in the 2007 SNC review. Classified credits (credits with well-defined weaknesses) increased $91.5 billion and represent 5.8 percent of the SNC portfolio compared with 3.1 percent in the 2007 SNC review. The criticized credits and related ratios do not include the effects of hedging or other techniques that organizations often use to mitigate risk.Classified credits held by United States (U.S.) domiciled banking organizations increased to $47.2 billion from $19.2 billion, and the classified ratio increased to 4.1 percent from 2.0 percent, still low compared to the entire portfolio. Classified credits held by foreign banking organizations increased to $45.9 billion, and the classified ratio increased to 4.2 percent from 1.9 percent. Classified credits held by non-bank entities increased to $70.0 billion from $34.8 billion and represent 42.9 percent of classified credits. The volume of classified credits held by non-banks is particularly significant given their relatively small 19.9 percent share of the SNC portfolio.For the second consecutive year, the review included an assessment of underwriting standards. Examiners again found an inordinate volume of syndicated loans with structurally weak underwriting characteristics particularly in non-investment grade or leveraged transactions.Note: Figures may not add to totals due to rounding.
Year dates represent the official SNC review period. Credit data is collected as of December 31 and updated through the end of the annual review.Overview
The 2008 SNC review included 8,746 credits totaling $2.8 trillion extended to 5,742 borrowers. Credit commitments increased by a record $514 billion, or 22.6 percent, following $401 billion growth, or 21.4 percent, in the 2007 SNC Review. This represents the largest percentage growth since 1998 and reflects the merger and acquisition financing boom that continued through the first half of 2007. Total outstandings, or drawn amounts, of $1.2 trillion were up $373 billion, or 44.6 percent, and represent 43.3 percent of commitments compared with 36.7 percent in 2007.Criticized credits rose to $373.4 billion and represent 13.4 percent of the SNC portfolio compared with only 5.0 percent in the 2007 SNC review. Special mention credits increased to $210.4 billion from $42.5 billion in 2007 and represent 7.5 percent of the SNC portfolio compared with only 1.9 percent in 2007. Special mention credits also constitute a much higher percentage of total criticized credits this year at 56.4 percent compared with 37.3 percent in 2007. A large number of special mention credits support highly leveraged merger and acquisition transactions originated in 2006 and 2007 that are characterized by weak underwriting standards.Classified credits rose to $163.1 billion from $71.6 billion and represent 5.8 percent of the SNC portfolio compared with 3.1 percent in 2007. Credits classified substandard rose to $154.9 billion from the 2007 review. The severity of the classifications increased this year with doubtful and loss credits totaling $8.1 billion compared with $2.0 billion in 2007. Nonaccrual4 classified credits increased to $22.3 billion from $3.9 billion, but represent a relatively low 0.80 percent of the total portfolio.Industry Trends
The agencies are introducing an industry presentation format that aggregates industries vertically along product origination and distribution lines. The industry format places credits in seven primary groups, largely following the outline of the 2007 Census NAICS codes (See Appendix B). The seven primary groups are further dissected into twenty-four sectors constructed from ninety-three sub-sectors. An industry mapping file (92 KB PDF) is included as an attachment to the press release.Services is the largest group at $788 billion, or 28.3 percent of the total portfolio, and increased by 33.7 percent from 2007. Commodities is the second largest group at $597 billion, or 21.4 percent of the total portfolio, and increased 35.9 percent. Financial is the third largest group at $545 billion, or 19.6 percent of the total portfolio. Within the industry groups, sectors with the largest growth are Media and Telecom at $78 billion, or 36.4 percent, Utilities at $63 billion, or 38.3 percent, Finance and Insurance at $62 billion, or 13.2 percent, and Oil and Gas at $50 billion, or 36.2 percent. Eighteen of the twenty-four sectors experienced double digit growth rates.Criticized credits are concentrated in Services, $151.4 billion or 40.6 percent of total criticized credits, Commodities, $69.5 billion or 18.6 percent, and Manufacturers, $53.4 billion or 14.3 percent. Special mention credits constitute 70.4 percent and 78.0 percent of the criticized credits in the Services and Commodities groups, respectively, but only 24.7 percent of the Manufacturers group. The highest criticized industry groups by percentage are Services, 19.2 percent; Real Estate, 15.6 percent; and Manufacturers, 13.4 percent. Within the industry groups, the highest criticized sectors by percentage are Automotive, 41.5 percent; Commercial Services, 40.8 percent; Transportation Services, 24.3 percent; and Media and Telecom, 24.0 percent.Classified credits are concentrated in Services, $44.8 billion, Manufacturers, $40.2 billion, Financial, $29.9 billion, and Real Estate, $25.3 billion. Real Estate is the highest classified group at 11.4 percent followed by Manufacturers at 10.1 percent. Within the industry groups, highly classified sectors include Automotive, 34.7 percent, Food and Drug Stores, 14.0 percent, Transportation Services, 12.4 percent, and Real Estate and Construction, 11.4 percent.Special mention credits are concentrated in the Media and Telecom sector, $47.1 billion or 22.4 percent of special mention; Materials and Commodities Excluding Energy, $27.9 billion or 13.3 percent; Commercial Services, $23.8 billion or 11.3 percent; and Utilities, $23.6 billion or 11.2 percent.Trends by Entity Type
The portion of SNC credit commitments held by U.S. domiciled banking organizations declined slightly to 41.1 percent from 42.7 percent, the fourth consecutive year of decline. Holdings by foreign banking organizations declined as well to 39 percent from 41.4 percent. Holdings by non-bank organizations, such as securitization pools, hedge funds, insurance companies, and pension funds, increased to 19.9 percent from 15.9 percent.Non-bank organizations hold the largest volume and percentage of classified credits at $70 billion, or 42.9 percent of total classified credits compared with 48.6 percent in 2007. In addition, 12.6 percent of non-bank organization credits are classified compared with only 4.1 percent of the U.S. bank portfolio and 4.2 percent of the foreign bank portfolio.Although non-bank organizations continue to hold the largest dollar volume and percentage of classified credits, the growth in classified credits over the past year was evenly distributed. Classified credits held by U.S. banks increased $28.0 billion, or 145.8 percent, with foreign banks classified credits increasing $28.3 billion and non-banks classified credits increasing $35.2 billion, or 101.2 percent.SNC Underwriting
The SNC Review included an evaluation of underwriting standards on approximately one thousand credits booked, or funded, in 2007. Areas evaluated included structure, repayment terms, pricing, collateral, loan agreements, and financial analysis and monitoring techniques. Examiners continued to identify an inordinate volume of syndicated loans with structurally weak underwriting characteristics, particularly for credits supporting M&A transactions of highly leveraged companies. Nearly all these credits were underwritten prior to the disruptions in the credit market in mid 2007.The most commonly cited types of structurally weak underwriting were liberal repayment terms, repayment dependent on refinancing or recapitalization, and nonexistent or weak loan covenants. Examiners also found that an excessive number of loan agreements did not provide adequate warnings and allow for proactive control over the credit.The impact of the volume of syndicated loans with structurally weak underwriting characteristics is evidenced by the rise in criticized credits this year. In fact, 56 percent of the 2007 vintage credits included in this year's underwriting review were criticized special mention or substandard compared with 21 percent last year. In addition, most of the 2006 vintage credits that were analyzed during the 2007 SNC review remain outstanding, and the criticized percentage of those credits has increased to 33 percent.The agencies have longstanding guidance, particularly through their April 2001 Interagency Guidance on Leveraged Financing, Sound Risk Management Practices, stressing the importance of prudential underwriting for leveraged financial transactions. However, examiners have found that underwriting practices are more likely to be compromised when syndicated loans are underwritten for resale versus more prudential underwriting standards used for loans held for investment. Consequently, banks that originate syndicated loans for distribution should have risk management systems in place to ensure underwriting standards are reasonably consistent with underwriting standards used if holding the loan for investment. More specifically, banks should ensure underwriting practices include a comprehensive and realistic assessment of a borrower's capacity to repay or de-lever over a reasonable period of time. SNCs with structurally weak underwriting characteristics and borrower financial performance and projections that do not support the prospects of reasonable repayment will be subject to regulatory criticism by the agencies.In addition, syndicated pipeline commitments are expected to be periodically evaluated to determine if creditworthiness, pricing, and covenant structures provide reasonable protection in the event of a change in market credit risk appetite. Credit commitments that do not fit an institution's hold for investment criteria should be subjected to concentration limits and stress testing processes that evaluate a borrower's ability to perform under different economic scenarios.IndustryServicesCommitment462.8407.6377.1401.6464.0589.3788.1Classified56.551.921.624.020.118.144.8Special Mention19.911.912.75.713.314.3106.6% Classified12.2%12.7%5.7%6.0%4.3%3.1%5.7%% Special Mention4.3%2.9%3.4%1.4%2.9%2.4%13.5%CommoditiesCommitment395.1345.7312.0325.6364.1439.6597.4Classified35.255.332.718.018.310.715.3Special Mention26.726.715.28.97.67.054.2% Classified8.9%16.0%10.5%5.5%5.0%2.4%2.6%% Special Mention6.8%7.7%4.9%2.7%2.1%1.6%9.1%FinancialCommitment414.4381.6372.7363.2431.1506.3545.2Classified12.09.54.20.92.119.229.9Special Mention4.73.70.60.52.93.313.9% Classified2.9%2.5%1.1%0.3%0.5%3.8%5.5%% Special Mention1.1%1.0%0.2%0.1%0.7%0.7%2.5%ManufacturersCommitment337.5283.8261.7271.9289.4339.4397.4Classified42.627.911.67.318.818.840.2Special Mention16.78.72.69.68.110.813.2% Classified12.6%9.8%4.4%2.7%6.5%5.5%10.1%% Special Mention5.0%3.1%1.0%3.5%2.8%3.2%3.3%Real EstateCommitment106.297.999.5122.9159.2203.6221.1Classified3.02.31.60.60.62.925.3Special Mention1.41.60.90.20.52.29.2% Classified2.8%2.4%1.6%0.5%0.4%1.4%11.4%% Special Mention1.3%1.6%0.9%0.1%0.3%1.1%4.2%DistributionCommitment129.7112.0108.7122.3146.1175.7206.9Classified8.05.42.21.71.51.97.5Special Mention9.52.60.91.00.94.713.2% Classified6.2%4.8%2.0%1.4%1.0%1.1%3.6%% Special Mention7.3%2.3%0.8%0.8%0.6%2.7%6.4%GovernmentCommitment20.918.414.319.120.121.633.1Classified0.20.20.00.00.40.10.0Special Mention0.10.10.10.00.10.10.1% Classified0.9%0.8%0.3%0.1%1.8%0.5%0.0%% Special Mention0.5%0.5%0.6%0.0%0.4%0.2%0.4%All Industries (Total)Commitment1,866.71,647.01,546.11,626.61,873.92,275.42,789.2Classified157.5152.474.052.561.871.7163.0Special Mention79.155.332.825.933.442.4210.4% Classified8.4%9.3%4.8%3.2%3.3%3.2%5.8%% Special Mention4.2%3.4%2.1%1.6%1.8%1.9%7.5%Note: Figures may not add to totals due to rounding.Total Classifications ($ billion)Classifieds as % of CommitmentsTotal Nonaccrual Commitments ($ billion)(*)Uninsured refers to organizations that do not take consumer deposits such as holding companies, brokerage firms, finance companies, etc.

In 2001, the Office of Thrift Supervision became an assisting agency. The annual program seeks to provide an efficient and consistent review and classification of shared national credits. Return to text2. A SNC is any loan and/or formal loan commitment, and any asset such as other real estate, stocks, notes, bonds and debentures taken as debts previously contracted, extended to borrowers by a supervised institution, its subsidiaries and affiliates. Further, a SNC must have an original amount that aggregates $20 million or more and either 1) is shared by three or more unaffiliated supervised institutions under a formal lending agreement or 2) a portion is sold to two or more unaffiliated supervised institutions with the purchasing institutions assuming their pro rata share of the credit risk.Credits include syndicated loans and loan commitments, letters of credit, commercial leases, as well as other forms of credit. Credit commitments include both drawn and undrawn portions of credit facilities. This release reports only the par amounts of commitments; these may differ from the amounts at which loans are carried by investors.A supervised institution is one which is subject to supervision by one of the federal bank regulatory agencies, including all FDIC-insured banks, their branches, subsidiaries, and affiliates; bank holding companies and their non-bank subsidiaries and affiliates; and federal and state-licensed branches and agencies of foreign banks. Return to text3.  Criticized credits are the total of credits classified substandard, doubtful, and loss--and credits rated special mention. Classified credits are only those rated substandard, doubtful, and loss. Under the agencies' Uniform Loan Classification Standards, classified credits have well-defined weaknesses, including default in some cases. Special mention credits exhibit potential weaknesses, which may result in further deterioration if left uncorrected.Excerpt from federal banking agencies' examination manuals defining regulatory classifications: A Substandard asset is inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Assets so classified must have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. An asset classified Doubtful has all the weaknesses inherent in one classified Substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. Assets classified Loss are considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as bankable assets is not warranted. This classification does not mean that the asset has absolutely no recovery or salvage value but rather that it is not practical or desirable to defer writing off this basically worthless asset even though partial recovery may be affected in the future. Amounts classified Loss should be promptly charged off.Excerpt from the June 10, 1993 Interagency Statement on the Supervisory Definition of Special Mention Assets: A Special Mention asset has potential weaknesses that deserve management's close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the asset or in the institution's credit position at some future date. Special Mention assets are not adversely classified and do not expose an institution to sufficient risk to warrant adverse classification. Return to text4. Nonaccrual loans are defined for regulatory reporting purposes as ""loans and lease financing receivables that are required to be reported on a nonaccrual basis because (a) they are maintained on a cash basis due to a deterioration in the financial position of the borrower, (b) payment in full of interest or principal is not expected, or (c) principal or interest has been in default for 90 days or longer, unless the obligation is both well secured and in the process of collection.""

601,4/30/2008,"The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to lower its target for the federal funds rate 25 basis points to 2 percent.Recent information indicates that economic activity remains weak. Household and business spending has been subdued and labor markets have softened further. Financial markets remain under considerable stress, and tight credit conditions and the deepening housing contraction are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters.Although readings on core inflation have improved somewhat, energy and other commodity prices have increased, and some indicators of inflation expectations have risen in recent months. The Committee expects inflation to moderate in coming quarters, reflecting a projected leveling-out of energy and other commodity prices and an easing of pressures on resource utilization. Still, uncertainty about the inflation outlook remains high. It will be necessary to continue to monitor inflation developments carefully.The substantial easing of monetary policy to date, combined with ongoing measures to foster market liquidity, should help to promote moderate growth over time and to mitigate risks to economic activity. The Committee will continue to monitor economic and financial developments and will act as needed to promote sustainable economic growth and price stability.Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S. Bernanke, Chairman; Timothy F. Geithner, Vice Chairman; Donald L. Kohn; Randall S. Kroszner; Frederic S. Mishkin; Sandra Pianalto; Gary H. Stern; and Kevin M. Warsh. Voting against were Richard W. Fisher and Charles I. Plosser, who preferred no change in the target for the federal funds rate at this meeting.In a related action, the Board of Governors unanimously approved a 25-basis-point decrease in the discount rate to 2-1/4 percent. In taking this action, the Board approved the requests submitted by the Boards of Directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of New York, Cleveland, Atlanta, and San Francisco."

[email protected]Minneapolis, Minn.--The Federal Reserve Banks today announced modifications to the schedule for previously announced check processing infrastructure changes as consumers and businesses continue the shift from using paper checks toward electronic payments and as financial institutions rapidly adopt electronic check processing.In June 2007, the Federal Reserve Banks selected Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, and Dallas as regional check processing sites that are expected to provide a full range of paper check processing services and receive processing volume from other sites in a phased transition.  Other remaining sites will have their operations scaled back.  These scaled-back sites will all print substitute checks, but some will also capture paper check images for processing.The revised schedule will take effect immediately, with seven sites transitioning in 2008 as opposed to the five that were originally scheduled. Also, the overall transition schedule has been shortened and is set to conclude in early 2010 instead of early 2011. The Reserve Banks will continue to review their check infrastructure annually to respond to further change within the nation's payments system and to meet statutory requirements for long-term cost recovery.""The transition in consumer and business preferences from paper checks to electronic payments is moving at a very brisk pace.  The revised schedule announced today enables the Reserve Banks to continue to provide high-quality check processing services to depository institutions throughout the country.  Today's announcement also supports our business strategy to use the authority provided by Check 21 to collect more checks electronically, reducing the reliance on the physical transportation of checks,"" said Gary Stern, chairman of the Reserve Banks' Financial Services Policy Committee and president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis.Today's announcement marks the Reserve Banks' sixth annual review of their check infrastructure. Since 2003, the Reserve Banks have reduced the locations where they process checks from 45 to 18.  The accelerated schedule for 2008 includes five sites converting to print-only locations (Kansas City, Mo.; Memphis, Tenn.; Cincinnati; Windsor Locks, Conn.; and Jacksonville, Fla.), one site (Seattle) converting to a capture and print site, and one site that just closed (Utica, N.Y.).The table below describes the revised schedule for each Reserve Bank location.The Reserve Banks earned revenues the last three years that exceeded the actual and imputed costs of providing check services to depository institutions as well as their targeted level of profitability. But check volumes have continued to decline, and further decline is anticipated in the coming years. The most recent Federal Reserve study of the nation's payment system revealed that about 30 billion checks were paid in the United States in 2006--down from 37 billion in 2003 and 42 billion in 2001--as electronic payments, including those made by credit cards, debit cards, and automated clearinghouse transactions, increased considerably.The Federal Reserve Banks' long-term check processing strategy is to reduce costs and restructure their check processing operations in line with declining check volumes while encouraging the greater use of electronics in the collection of checks. This strategy will allow the Reserve Banks to meet the expectations of the 1980 Monetary Control Act. That act requires the Federal Reserve to set prices to recover, over the long run, its total operating costs of providing payment services to depository institutions, as well as the imputed costs it would have incurred and the profits it would have expected to earn had the services been provided by a private business firm."

Financial markets have been volatile in recent weeks, credit conditions have become tighter for some households and businesses, and the housing correction is ongoing. Nevertheless, the economy seems likely to continue to expand at a moderate pace over coming quarters, supported by solid growth in employment and incomes and a robust global economy.Readings on core inflation have improved modestly in recent months. However, a sustained moderation in inflation pressures has yet to be convincingly demonstrated. Moreover, the high level of resource utilization has the potential to sustain those pressures.Although the downside risks to growth have increased somewhat, the Committee's predominant policy concern remains the risk that inflation will fail to moderate as expected. Future policy adjustments will depend on the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information.Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S.

632,8/6/2007,"The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) on Monday announced that they have concurrently assessed $20 million in civil money penalties against American Express Bank International (AEBI) of Miami, Florida, for violations of the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA).  In addition, FinCEN announced a separate $5 million civil money penalty against American Express Travel Related Services Company, Inc., a money services business, located in Salt Lake City, Utah, for its violations of the BSA.The orders are part of coordinated actions with the U.S. Department of Justice, which is today announcing the execution of a deferred prosecution agreement with AEBI in connection with charges that the company failed to maintain an anti-money laundering program.  AEBI will forfeit $55 million to the United States to settle the Department’s forfeiture claims.The payments to be made by the American Express entities under these actions total $65 million.  FinCEN’s total penalties of $25 million will be satisfied by a single $10 million payment to the U.S. Department of the Treasury, and the remaining $15 million satisfied by a portion of the $55 million forfeiture to the U.S. Department of Justice.  The Federal Reserve Board’s $20 million penalty will be deemed satisfied by the payments made by AEBI to the U.S. Department of Justice and FinCEN.The Federal Reserve Board concurrently issued a Cease and Desist Order requiring AEBI to take certain corrective actions.  AEBI and American Express Travel Related Services, without admitting any allegations, consented to the payment of the penalties and the issuance of the orders by the Federal Reserve Board and FinCEN.The Federal Reserve Board based its assessment of a civil money penalty and issuance of a Cease and Desist Order on the failure of AEBI to establish and maintain an adequate anti-money laundering program.  AEBI is an Edge Act corporation that offers traditional private banking services.  The Federal Reserve Board determined that AEBI had significant breakdowns in carrying out its BSA compliance activities and, as a result, failed to establish and maintain procedures adequately designed to ensure and monitor AEBI’s compliance with the BSA and related laws and regulations.""Today's action by the Federal Reserve underscores the necessity for banking institutions to have anti-money laundering controls in place that are commensurate with the level of risk associated with their operations.  Every banking organization should ensure that its risk-management practices are effective in mitigating the risks associated with its particular operations,” said Roger T. Cole, director of the Federal Reserve Board’s Division of Banking Supervision and Regulation.FinCEN determined that AEBI repeatedly failed, over the course of several years, to adequately respond to certain supervisory findings with respect to the effectiveness of account monitoring controls to ensure compliance with the BSA.  FinCEN also determined that AEBI failed to implement adequate internal controls, failed to conduct adequate independent testing, and failed to designate compliance personnel to ensure compliance with the BSA.  AEBI operated in certain high-risk jurisdictions and business lines without commensurate systems and controls to detect and report money laundering and other suspicious activity in a timely manner, as well as manage the risks of money laundering, including the potential for illicit drug trafficking-based Black Market Peso Exchange transactions.  FinCEN also determined that the money services business, a wholly-owned subsidiary of American Express Company, failed to file a significant number of suspicious activity reports in accordance with the BSA.“These joint and concurrent actions serve as another example of collaboration by federal agencies to apply a consistent approach to Bank Secrecy Act enforcement,” said FinCEN Director James H. Freis, Jr.  “Enforcement actions, especially major enforcement actions, are rare and only applied when appropriate.  It is a well-considered public policy choice to place BSA responsibilities on our financial institutions which serve as gatekeepers to the financial system.  The information lost when a company fails in its obligations puts other companies, and the broader financial system, at risk.”Copies of the agencies’ enforcement actions are attached.FinCEN enforcement action (3.4 MB PDF)U.S. Department of Justice deferred prosecution agreement (1.1 MB PDF)"

642,9/25/2006,"Note: Tables 1 and 2 and the last sentence of the Overview section revised September 26, 2006.The volume of syndicated credits rose rapidly, in part reflecting a rise in merger and acquisition activity over the past year, according to the Shared National Credit (SNC)2 review released today by federal bank and thrift regulators. The review noted a small increase in problem credits as a share of commitments in 2006. The bulk of this increase was associated with credits held by nonbank3 entities while problem loans at regulated institutions, particularly those with insured deposits, grew slightly. Deterioration in exposures to the manufacturing sector, primarily the automotive industry, accounted for most of the softening in asset quality. The review affirmed that most other industries exhibit improved credit quality from peak problem levels experienced only a few years ago. Examiners also found, however, a continued easing of underwriting standards in the syndicated lending market in general, particularly in non-investment grade or leveraged credit facilities.

The results--reported by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of Thrift Supervision--are based on analyses prepared in the second quarter of 2006 and reflect business and economic conditions at that time.Total adversely rated credits4 rose slightly to 5.1 percent of total commitments from 4.8 percent a year ago (see Chart 1). Similarly, the ratio of classified commitments to total commitments rose slightly to 3.3 percent from 3.2 percent last year. Total classified commitments rose by $9.4 billion, or 18 percent, since 2005, compared with a net decrease of $21.5 billion, or 29 percent, the previous year. Commitments rated special mention increased by $7.5 billion, or 29 percent, in contrast to 2005 when they fell by $7.0 billion, or 21 percent.Classified commitments held by United States (US) domiciled banking organizations increased to $13.1 billion from $11.9 billion in 2005, but the classified ratio remained at only 1.6 percent due to growth in these companies’ syndicated credit portfolios.These discussions of adversely rated credits and their ratios do not include the effects of hedging or other techniques that organizations often employ to mitigate risk.OverviewIn aggregate, the 2006 SNC Program covered 7,009 credits totaling $1.9 trillion in credit commitments to 4,833 borrowers. Total SNC commitments increased by nearly $250 billion, a 15.2 percent increase from 2005, the largest annual expansion in nearly eight years. The current level of commitments is slightly below the 2001 peak of $2.0 trillion, while adversely rated commitments are only 40 percent of their peak level in 2002. The increase in 2006 total commitments reflects, in part, substantial merger and acquisition financing provided over the past year. Total outstandings, or drawn amounts, of $626 billion were up 20 percent from the prior year.For the 2006 review, total commitments classified as substandard rose $14.0 billion, or 32 percent from the prior year, while doubtful credits decreased $3.1 billion, or 55 percent (see Table 1). Commitments classified as loss fell $1.5 billion, down 56 percent from the prior year. Outstanding nonaccrual5 classified credits fell 29 percent to $17.7 billion.Industry TrendsThe volume of classified SNCs improved slightly in most industries (see Appendix B)6 , with the notable exception of the Manufacturing sector. While commitments to this sector increased 8.4 percent, weakness in the automotive industry during the year led to a $15.6 billion, or 147 percent, increase in classified credits. This softness in the manufacturing sector overshadowed notable improvements in loan classifications in the Oil, Gas, Pipelines & Utilities sector, Lodging & Transportation sector, the Construction & Real Estate sector, and the Professional, Scientific & Other Services sector, each with classified volumes falling by approximately one-third. Classified commitments also declined for the Telecommunication and Cable industry (by $2.4 billion or 14 percent), but remain elevated at 10 percent of total commitments.The volume of special mention SNC credits increased 29 percent or $7.5 billion, with increases observed in most industries except Manufacturing and Professional Services.Trends by Entity TypeDuring 2006, the portion of SNC commitments held by U.S. domiciled banking organizations edged down 0.5 percentage points to 44 percent, a level mostly unchanged in the past five years. Compared to last year, the portion held by foreign banking organizations (FBOs) also slipped 0.5 percentage points to 41 percent in 2006 (see Table 2).Over the past ten years, lenders not affiliated with banks, such as brokerage firms, mutual funds, insurance companies, and hedge funds, have taken on larger positions in the syndicated market. These nonbank entities have increased their share to 14 percent of total commitments compared to 8 percent five years ago and 2 percent in 1996.The quality of holdings also varied among entity types with classified commitments amounting to 1.6 percent of total commitments at U.S. banks compared with 2.2 percent at FBOs and 11.8 percent at nonbanks. Nonbank holdings of classified commitments increased even more dramatically over the past five years than their overall syndicated credit holdings, increasing from 21 percent of all classified credit commitments in 2001 to 51 percent in 2006. U.S. banks only held 21 percent of classified commitments in 2006. Total nonaccrual loans improved for U.S. banks and FBOs, but worsened for nonbanks. Nonbank entities held 58 percent of nonaccrual loans in 2006 with U.S. banks only holding 16 percent.Total Classifications ($ billion)Classifieds as % of CommitmentsTotal Nonaccrual Commitments ($ billion)(*) Uninsured refers to organizations that do not take consumer deposits such as holding companies, brokerage firms, finance companies, etc.Note: Figures may not add to totals due to rounding.Risk Management by BanksStrong market competition and a highly liquid secondary loan market have contributed to easing of credit underwriting standards in large corporate and leveraged loans. Demand for bank loans from non-bank institutional investors has influenced underwriting terms and pushed credit spreads lower. Of note is the increasing volume of term loans with nominal amortization required prior to maturity and loosened financial loan covenants such as leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios.Although credit risk in SNC portfolios of U.S domiciled banking organizations is low and generally stable, rapid portfolio growth, easing of underwriting standards, and the increase in adversely rated commitments over the past year are indicative of increasing credit risk. Banking organizations should ensure that competitive pressures and easing of underwriting standards do not unduly compromise their tolerance for credit risk. In addition, advanced credit risk management systems should exist to appropriately measure, monitor and control risks in large corporate portfolios.IndustryTelecommunication & CableCommitment197.5174.1149.7120.2123.7149.8Classified6.938.135.713.117.014.6Special Mention10.09.07.010.82.56.2% Classified3.5%21.9%23.8%10.9%13.7%9.7%% Special Mention5.0%5.1%4.7%9.0%2.0%4.1%ManufacturingCommitment540.5494.8424.4400.1409.7444.3Classified58.160.942.619.610.726.4Special Mention27.026.222.86.916.612.2% Classified10.8%12.3%10.0%4.9%2.6%5.9%% Special Mention5.0%5.3%5.4%1.7%4.0%2.7%Professional, Scientific, & Other ServicesCommitment157.9124.9122.4107.3102.2125.4Classified11.98.86.83.31.51.0Special Mention4.52.31.81.11.30.3% Classified7.5%7.0%5.5%3.1%1.5%0.8%% Special Mention2.8%1.9%1.5%1.0%1.3%0.3%Oil, Gas, Pipeline & UtilitiesCommitment222.8229.5200.5175.7186.4208.9Classified4.317.138.124.214.19.7Special Mention7.015.512.310.11.92.0% Classified1.9%7.4%19.0%13.8%7.5%4.6%% Special Mention3.1%6.8%6.1%5.8%1.0%1.0%Construction & Real EstateCommitment100.196.787.590.2107.9124.0Classified4.74.13.62.50.70.4Special Mention1.93.22.30.90.30.6% Classified4.7%4.2%4.1%2.8%0.6%0.3%% Special Mention1.9%3.3%2.6%1.0%0.2%0.5%Lodging & TransportationCommitment99.182.974.874.176.580.8Classified3.16.67.75.23.72.5Special Mention6.75.31.80.70.84.5% Classified3.1%7.9%10.3%7.1%4.9%3.1%% Special Mention6.8%6.4%2.4%1.0%1.1%5.6%Financial Services & InsuranceCommitment420.0376.5343.3337.1336.0424.0Classified11.98.96.72.10.10.8Special Mention4.42.92.50.50.22.8% Classified2.8%2.4%1.9%0.6%0.0%0.2%% Special Mention1.1%0.8%0.7%0.2%0.1%0.7%All OtherCommitment310.8291.6241.0240.4284.2316.7Classified16.512.711.03.84.76.4Special Mention13.914.64.71.82.44.8% Classified5.3%4.4%4.6%1.6%1.6%2.0%% Special Mention4.5%5.0%2.0%0.7%0.8%1.5%All Industries (Total)Commitment2,048.91,871.01,643.51,545.21,626.71,873.9Classified117.5157.1152.272.452.561.8Special Mention75.479.055.232.825.933.4% Classified5.7%*8.4%*9.3%*4.8%3.2%3.3%% Special Mention3.7%*4.2%*3.4%*2.1%1.6%1.8%Endnotes1.

The Shared National Credit (SNC) Program was established in 1977 by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. In 2001 the Office of Thrift Supervision became an assisting agency. With a few exceptions, the annual program, which seeks to provide an efficient and consistent review and classification of large syndicated loans, generally covers loans or loan commitments of at least $20 million that are shared by three or more regulated financial institutions.

Adversely rated credits (also known as criticized credits) are the total of credits classified substandard, doubtful, and loss – and credits rated special mention. Classified credits are only those rated substandard, doubtful, and loss. Under the agencies’ Uniform Loan Classification Standards, classified credits have well-defined weaknesses, including default in some cases. Special mention credits exhibit potential weaknesses, which may result in further deterioration if left uncorrected.Excerpt from Federal Reserve’s SR Letter 79-556 defining regulatory classifications:
Classification ratings are defined as “Substandard,” “Doubtful,” and “Loss.” A Substandard asset is inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Assets so classified must have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the bank will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. An asset classified as Doubtful has all the weakness inherent in one classified Substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make the collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. Assets classified as Loss are considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as bankable assets is not warranted. This classification does not mean that the asset has absolutely no recovery or salvage value, but rather it is not practical or desirable to defer writing off this basically worthless asset even though partial recovery may be effected in the future.Excerpt from June 10, 1993, Interagency Statement on the Supervisory Definition of Special Mention Assets:
A Special Mention asset has potential weaknesses that deserve management’s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the asset or in the institution’s credit position at some future date. Special Mention assets are not adversely classified and do not expose an institution to sufficient risk to warrant adverse classification. Return to text5. Nonaccrual loans are defined for regulatory reporting purposes as “loans and lease financing receivables that are required to be reported on a nonaccrual basis because (a) they are maintained on a cash basis due to a deterioration in the financial position of the borrower, (b) payment in full of interest or principal is not expected, or (c) principal or interest has been in default for 90 days or longer, unless the obligation is both well secured and in the process of collection.” Return to text6.

654,9/5/2006,"The federal bank and thrift regulatory agencies announced today that they will request public comment on a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR) that would implement new risk-based capital requirements in the United States for large, internationally active banking organizations. The NPR details the agencies' plans for implementing the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision's (BCBS) new capital accord (Basel II) that was issued in 2004. The agencies also will request comment on proposed Basel II supervisory reporting templates.The Federal Reserve Board (Board), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) first adopted risk-based capital standards in 1989. Those standards were based on the Basel Capital Accord that the BCBS originally issued in 1988 (Basel I). For banking organizations that meet qualifying criteria, the Basel II NPR would replace U.S. rules implementing Basel I. The proposed framework would be mandatory for large, internationally active banking organizations and optional for others.In March of this year, the Board released a preliminary draft of the Basel II NPR. The version being made available today differs in some respects from the March draft. For example, the agencies have responded to certain requests from the industry to seek comment on alternative risk-based capital approaches and have clarified that in evaluating credit risk, banking organizations should not rely on the possibility of U.S. government financial assistance, except for the financial assistance that the government has legally committed to provide. The final document, which will be published in the Federal Register shortly, should be used as the basis for comments.Separately, the agencies announced that they will request comment on proposed revisions to the market risk capital rules that the OCC, Board, and FDIC have used since 1997 for banking organizations with significant exposure to market risk. Under the market risk capital rule, certain banking organizations are required to calculate a capital requirement for the general market risk of their covered positions and the specific risk of their covered debt and equity positions. The proposed revisions would enhance the rule's risk sensitivity and would require public disclosures of certain qualitative and quantitative market risk information.The notice of proposed rulemaking on the market risk capital rule would implement changes the BCBS approved in 2005 and also would apply to certain savings associations, which currently are not covered under the rule. The agencies will also seek comment on proposed supervisory reporting templates related to the market risk capital rule.The Board, FDIC, OCC and OTS request comments on the proposals within 120 days of publication in the Federal Register. The proposals are attached.The agencies remain committed to issuing in the near future additional proposed revisions to their existing risk-based capital rules, known as Basel IA, in a timeframe that will allow for overlapping comment periods for both the Basel II NPR and the NPR for the proposed Basel IA revisions.Basel II Notice of proposed rulemaking Draft Federal Register notice and supervisory reporting templates (501 KB PDF)Market risk Notice of proposed rulemaking (291 KB PDF)Notice of proposed rulemaking (161 KB TXT)Draft Federal Register notice and supervisory reporting templates (71 KB PDF)"

680,6/22/2006,"The Federal Reserve Board on Thursday requested comment on proposed revisions to Part I of its Policy on Payments System Risk (PSR policy), which addresses risk management in payments and settlement systems.The proposed revisions update and revise the policy in several ways. First, the Board is proposing to incorporate into its PSR policy the international risk management standards for central counterparties recently developed by the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (CPSS) of the central banks of the Group of Ten countries and the Technical Committee of the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO). These standards, published by the Bank for International Settlements in a report titled Recommendations for Central Counterparties (Recommendations for CCP), will serve as the Board's minimum standards for central counterparties identified as systemically important and subject to the Board's authority. This proposed change is consistent with past revisions that incorporated into the PSR policy the Core Principles for Systemically Important Payment Systems (Core Principles) and Recommendations for Securities Settlement Systems (Recommendations for SSS), developed by the CPSS and CPSS-IOSCO, respectively.In support of incorporating the Recommendations for CCP, the Board is proposing revisions to the scope of Part I of the PSR policy with regard to central counterparties. As revised, a central counterparty would be included as one of several types of systems that fall under the term ""settlement system"" as defined in the revised policy. The Board is also proposing revisions to the purposes of Part I of the policy to clarify its views on risk management for payments and settlement systems generally and its expectations for systems subject to its authority.Finally, the Board is proposing revisions that would establish an expectation that systemically important systems disclose publicly self-assessments against the principles or minimum standards incorporated in the PSR policy. Specifically, systemically important systems subject to the Board's authority will be expected to complete and disclose publicly self-assessments against the Core Principles, Recommendations for SSS, or Recommendations for CCP, as appropriate, and demonstrate the extent to which the system meets the principles or minimum standards. The Board is proposing several guidelines to assist a system operator in developing a self-assessment consistent with the Board's expectations.The Board is also making other technical changes to its PSR policy.Comments are requested by September 22, 2006.The Board's notice is attached."

685,6/16/2006,"The Federal Reserve Board, jointly with the Department of the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), on Friday issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR) that seeks information on the potential benefit and burden of lowering or eliminating the $3,000 threshold in the recordkeeping rule for funds transfers and transmittals of funds by financial institutions. The ANPR requests public comment on the potential benefit of a lower threshold to law enforcement and the potential burden of a lower threshold to the financial system. In addition, the ANPR seeks input from the general public on the potential impact that a lower threshold might have on their funds transfer or transmittal of funds practices.The Board concurs with FinCEN that this is an appropriate time to reassess the threshold in the recordkeeping rule in light of developments since adoption of the original rule in 1995. Specifically, the Financial Action Task Force, the international anti-money laundering and terrorist financing standard setter, recommends a de minimis threshold no higher than $1,000 (or €1000). In addition, advances in information technology may have reduced the burden to financial institutions of the recordkeeping requirement since adoption of the original rule.The Board and FinCEN request that comments on the ANPR be submitted within sixty days of publication in the Federal Register, which is expected shortly. The ANPR is attached.Attachment (63 KB PDF)"

In particular, the paper requests views on potential changes in market practices, depository institution and Federal Reserve Bank operations, and the Board's PSR Policy that could reduce one or more of these risks, while maintaining or improving the efficiency of the payments system over the long run.The consultation paper includes a brief list of possible changes that might further assist depository institutions, financial markets, and the Federal Reserve Banks in managing intraday risks. Items on the list should be regarded as preliminary and intended for further study.The consultation paper stems from the Federal Reserve's ongoing review of the long-term effects of market, operational, and policy changes by the financial industry and the Federal Reserve on intraday liquidity and risks in the financial markets and the payments system, including account overdrafts at the Reserve Banks.Comment is requested by December 15, 2006.The Board's consultation paper is attached."
688,6/15/2006,"The member agencies of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) and the Conference of State Bank Supervisors today announced the release of LESSONS LEARNED FROM HURRICANE KATRINA: Preparing Your Institution for a Catastrophic Event. The booklet relays financial institutions' experiences and lessons learned in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina that other institutions may find helpful in considering their readiness for a catastrophic event.Financial institutions face a wide variety of disasters across the United States that could have potentially devastating consequences. Following Hurricane Katrina, institutions' existing disaster recovery and business continuity plans generally worked well in enabling institutions to restore operations swiftly. However, the unprecedented destruction and aftermath of the hurricane caused major disruptions that exceeded the scope of some institutions' disaster recovery and business continuity plans. Major hardships faced by these institutions included the following:Financial institutions demonstrated great resiliency, working together to create solutions that allowed them to successfully operate under very difficult circumstances and to assist customers and communities in recovering from the hurricane.The lessons learned booklet is available on the FFIEC's web site at http://www.ffiec.gov/ as well as on each agency's web site. Insured depository institutions will soon receive a hard copy or an electronic copy of the booklet.Media Contacts:

689,6/13/2006,"The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency today issued the host state loan-to-deposit ratios that the banking agencies will use to determine compliance with section 109 of the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994. These ratios update data released on July 7, 2005.In general, section 109 prohibits a bank from establishing or acquiring a branch or branches outside of its home state primarily for the purpose of deposit production. Section 109 also prohibits branches of banks controlled by out-of-state bank holding companies from operating primarily for the purpose of deposit production.Section 109 provides a process to test compliance with the statutory requirements. The first step in the process involves a loan-to-deposit ratio screen that compares a bank's statewide loan-to-deposit ratio to the host state loan-to-deposit ratio for banks in a particular state.A second step is conducted if a bank's statewide loan-to-deposit ratio is less than one-half of the published ratio for that state or if data are not available at the bank to conduct the first step. The second step requires the appropriate banking agency to determine whether the bank is reasonably helping to meet the credit needs of the communities served by the bank's interstate branches.A bank that fails both steps is in violation of section 109 and is subject to sanctions by the appropriate banking agency.The updated host state loan-to-deposit ratios are attached.Attachment (39 KB PDF)"

[email protected]Minneapolis, Minn.--The Federal Reserve Banks today announced changes to their check operations as consumers and businesses continue the shift from using paper checks toward electronic payments. As part of these changes, the Federal Reserve Banks will discontinue check processing at locations in San Francisco, Kansas City, Mo., and Helena, Mont. Volume from these locations will be shifted to other Reserve Bank check processing centers. No firm date for the transition has been determined, but it is expected to take place in 2007 or the first half of 2008.""The changes announced today will help to ensure ongoing efficiency improvements for the Reserve Banks' check processing operations while we continue to provide high-quality services to depository institutions throughout the country and further encourage the greater use of electronics within the nation's check collection system,"" said Gary Stern, chairman of the Reserve Banks' Financial Services Policy Committee and president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. ""These changes will help the Reserve Banks reduce our check service operating costs in line with the continuing shift in consumer and business preferences for electronic payments. In addition, these changes support our long-term business strategy to use the authority provided by Check 21 to collect more checks electronically, reducing the reliance on the physical transportation of checks.""Today's announcement marks the Reserve Banks' fourth annual review of their check infrastructure. Since 2003, the Reserve Banks have reduced the locations where they process checks from 45 to 23 as of today. An additional two locations, previously announced, will no longer process checks, further reducing the number to 21. After the changes announced today are completed, the Reserve Banks will process checks from 18 locations nationwide.The new round of restructurings will transfer check processing operations from three locations: San Francisco to Los Angeles, Kansas City to St. Louis, and Helena to Denver. This decision impacts the Canadian check collection service provided by the Helena office. An announcement regarding the transfer of the Canadian check collection service to another Reserve Bank will be made by the end of 2006. Additionally, the Reserve Banks will streamline their check adjustment function, discontinuing adjustments at the Detroit, Helena, Houston, Memphis, Tenn., and San Francisco offices. (The term ""check adjustments"" refers to the part of the check processing operation in which check processing errors are resolved.)As a result of the action announced today, the Reserve Banks will reduce their overall check staff by approximately 280 positions, representing about 8 percent of the Reserve Banks' current check employees. Some staff reductions may occur through attrition and there may be some opportunities for reassignment. To assist affected staff, the Reserve Banks will offer a variety of programs, including separation packages, extended medical coverage, and career transition assistance. The Reserve Banks estimate that they will add approximately 150 positions in locations that will be receiving check processing and adjustments volume.As a direct result of previous restructuring efforts and other efficiency improvements implemented since 2003, the Reserve Banks earned revenues in 2005 that exceeded the actual and imputed costs of providing check services to depository institutions as well as their targeted level of profitability for the first time in several years. But check volumes have continued to decline, and further decline is anticipated in the coming years. The most recent Federal Reserve study of the nation's payment system revealed that about 37 billion checks were paid in the United States in 2003--down from 42 billion in 2001 and 50 billion in 1995--as electronic payments, including those made by credit cards, debit cards, and automated clearinghouse transactions, increased considerably. Further Reserve Bank restructuring efforts will be necessary as check volumes continue to decline and as more depository institutions begin to collect checks electronically using the authority provided by Check 21.The Federal Reserve Banks' long-term check processing strategy is to reduce costs and restructure their check processing operations in line with declining check volumes while encouraging the greater use of electronics in the collection of checks. This strategy will allow the Reserve Banks to meet the expectations of the 1980 Monetary Control Act. That act requires the Federal Reserve to set prices to recover, over the long run, its total operating costs of providing payment services to financial institutions, as well as the imputed costs it would have incurred and the profits it would have expected to earn had the services been provided by a private business firm.Federal Reserve System
2006 Check RestructuringFact SheetFederal Reserve check processing locations: The Reserve Banks today process checks at 23 sites nationwide with two more sites (previously announced) on target to discontinue operations in addition to the three locations identified in today's announcement.Staff levels: The Federal Reserve System, including the Board of Governors, employs over 21,000 staff nationwide; approximately 3,400 of these employees work in the check function.National check volumes: By Federal Reserve estimates, roughly 37 billion checks were paid in the United States in 2003, down from about 42 billion in 2001 and 50 billion in 1995 (based on data from the Reserve Banks' latest available payments study).

[email protected]Minneapolis, Minn.-- After completing a two-year review of their cash infrastructure, the Federal Reserve Banks today announced that the cash processing operation at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City's Omaha, Neb., branch will be changed to a cash depot. This change is part of a broader effort to update the Federal Reserve's infrastructure for processing currency.""We want to emphasize that the Federal Reserve will continue to make cash services available to depository institutions throughout the country, although in some cases we are employing a different business model. We want to ensure that we're making the best use of resources while satisfying the need for cash services,"" said Gary Stern, chairman of the Reserve Banks' Financial Services Policy Committee and president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis.Since 2004, the Federal Reserve discontinued cash services through branches in Little Rock, Ark., Louisville, Ky., Buffalo, N.Y., Portland, Ore., and Oklahoma City, Okla., and established cash depots in those cities.A cash depot is an alternative market presence for Federal Reserve cash services. With a cash depot, the Federal Reserve contracts with a third party--usually an armored carrier--that acts as a secure collection point for Federal Reserve currency deposits from the region's depository institutions. The depot also distributes currency orders that depository institutions have placed with the Reserve Bank. The work of counting deposits and preparing orders is done by a Federal Reserve office in another city. The Federal Reserve pays for the transportation between the Reserve Bank office and the depot. The depot operator follows strict procedures developed by the Federal Reserve.The Omaha cash depot will be serviced by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City's head office. Approximately 16 cash employees work at the Omaha branch, but the number that will be affected by this change is undetermined at this time. The Reserve Bank will offer a variety of programs to staff that are affected by these decisions, including separation packages, extended medical coverage and career transition assistance.Cash remains a vital component of the nation's payment system. While studies show that the use of electronic payments is growing, the amount of deposits and orders processed through Reserve Banks has increased nearly 66 percent, to 76 billion banknotes, between 1995 and 2005."
700,5/30/2006,"The Federal Reserve Board on Tuesday announced amendments to Appendix A of Regulation CC that reflect the previously-announced restructuring of the Federal Reserve's check processing operations in the Second and Third Districts.Appendix A provides a routing number guide that helps depository institutions determine the maximum permissible hold periods for most deposited checks. As of August 19, 2006, the East Rutherford office of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York no longer will process checks, and banks currently served by that office will be reassigned to the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. To ensure that the information in Appendix A accurately describes the structure of check processing operations within the Federal Reserve System, the final rule deletes the reference in Appendix A to the New York Reserve Bank's East Rutherford office and reassigns the routing numbers associated with the East Rutherford office to the Philadelphia Reserve Bank. To coincide with the effective date of the underlying check processing changes, the amendments are effective August 19, 2006. As a result of these changes, some checks deposited in the affected regions that currently are nonlocal checks will become local checks that are subject to shorter permissible hold periods.The Board's notice is attached.Attachment (35 KB PDF)"

711,5/10/2006,"The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 5 percent.Economic growth has been quite strong so far this year. The Committee sees growth as likely to moderate to a more sustainable pace, partly reflecting a gradual cooling of the housing market and the lagged effects of increases in interest rates and energy prices.As yet, the run-up in the prices of energy and other commodities appears to have had only a modest effect on core inflation, ongoing productivity gains have helped to hold the growth of unit labor costs in check, and inflation expectations remain contained. Still, possible increases in resource utilization, in combination with the elevated prices of energy and other commodities, have the potential to add to inflation pressures.The Committee judges that some further policy firming may yet be needed to address inflation risks but emphasizes that the extent and timing of any such firming will depend importantly on the evolution of the economic outlook as implied by incoming information. In any event, the Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to support the attainment of its objectives.Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S. Bernanke, Chairman; Timothy F. Geithner, Vice Chairman; Susan S. Bies; Jack Guynn; Donald L. Kohn; Randall S. Kroszner; Jeffrey M. Lacker; Mark W. Olson; Sandra Pianalto; Kevin M. Warsh; and Janet L.

713,5/1/2006,"The Federal Reserve Board on Monday invited consumers, consumer advocacy organizations, lenders, and other interested parties to participate in four public hearings on the home equity lending market.The Board is holding the hearings under the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act (HOEPA), which was enacted in 1994 in response to reports of predatory home equity lending practices in underserved markets. HOEPA amended the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) to impose additional disclosure requirements and limits on certain high-cost, home-secured loans. HOEPA also directs the Board to periodically hold public hearings to examine the home equity lending market and the adequacy of existing regulatory and legislative provisions for protecting the interests of consumers, particularly low-income consumers.The Board last held such hearings in 2000. Those hearings focused on ways the Board might use its rulemaking authority under HOEPA to address concerns about predatory lending. Following those hearings and the receipt of public comment, the Board amended the provisions of Regulation Z that implement HOEPA. The revisions took effect in October 2002.The Board's 2006 hearings will focus on three topics: (1) predatory lending and the impact of the HOEPA rules, and state and local anti-predatory lending laws on the subprime market; (2) nontraditional mortgage products such as interest only mortgage loans and payment option adjustable rate mortgages, and reverse mortgages; and (3) how consumers select lenders and mortgage products in the subprime mortgage market. Time will be reserved after panel discussions by invited speakers for brief statements from other interested parties.The hearing discussions will serve four objectives. First, the Board wishes to gather information on the effectiveness of the 2002 revisions to the HOEPA rules in protecting consumers and on the rules' impact on the availability of credit in the higher-cost portion of the subprime market. Second, the Board would like to gather information that will assist its pending review of Regulation Z, which implements TILA and HOEPA. Third, the hearings will focus on matters for which the Board or other entities can develop educational materials to help consumers make informed choices about mortgage loans. Fourth, the hearings will identify mortgage lending market issues that require additional research.The first hearing is scheduled for Wednesday, June 7, 2006, at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, 230 South LaSalle Street, Chicago, Illinois. The second is scheduled for Friday, June 9, 2006, at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, Ten Independence Mall, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The third is scheduled for Friday, June 16, 2006, at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, 101 Market Street, San Francisco, California, and the fourth is scheduled for Tuesday, July 11, 2006, at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, 1000 Peachtree Street, N.E., Atlanta, Georgia.All hearings are scheduled from 8:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m., and will begin with panel discussions by invited speakers. Other interested parties may deliver oral statements of five minutes or less at a one-hour ""open-mike"" period starting at about 3:00 p.m. Written statements of any length may be submitted for the record. Anyone interested in presenting an oral statement is asked to contact the Board in advance of the hearings by calling (202) 452-3667. As more information about the agenda for each hearing becomes available, it will be posted on the Board's web site.Written comments may be mailed to Jennifer J. Johnson, Secretary, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 20th Street and Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, DC 20551 or mailed electronically to [email protected].Public comments are due by August 15, 2006.

724,4/3/2006,"The federal bank, credit union, and thrift supervisory agencies, along with the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), today released updated ""Answers to Frequently Asked Questions"" (FAQs) to aid interpretation of the 2005 home loan data to be disclosed this year under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA).For the second year in a row, the data will include price information on loans priced above reporting thresholds set by the Federal Reserve Board regulation that implements HMDA, Regulation C. As of March 31, lenders started making these data available to the public upon request in the form of a Loan Application Register, after removing certain information to protect the privacy of applicants and borrowers. Summary statistical reports for each lender and an aggregate report for each Metropolitan Statistical Area will be released in September by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC).Preliminary indications are that the data will show that the proportion of mortgage loans with prices above the HMDA price reporting thresholds increased from 2004 to 2005. The updated FAQs, in newly added Question 27, explain that an increase is expected because of changes in the interest rate environment from 2004 to 2005--specifically, the narrowing of the difference between short-term interest rates and long-term interest rates (sometimes referred to as a ""flattening of the yield curve""). Changes in other factors, such as the business practices of lenders or the risk profiles or borrowing practices of borrowers, also could have affected the proportion of loans reported as higher-priced loans.The updated FAQs will be posted on each of the agencies' web sites and on the web site of the FFIEC.HMDA, which was enacted by Congress in 1975, requires most mortgage lenders located in metropolitan areas to collect data about their housing-related lending activity, report the data annually to the government, and make the data publicly available in a modified Loan Application Register.Initially, HMDA required reporting of the geographic location of originated and purchased home loans. In 1989, Congress expanded HMDA data to include information about denied home loan applications and the race, sex, and income of applicants and borrowers. In 2002, the Federal Reserve Board amended the HMDA regulations to require lenders to report price data for certain higher-priced home mortgage loans, and other new data.Attachment (73 KB PDF)"
725,3/31/2006,"Federal regulators today released Evolution of a Prototype Financial Privacy Notice, a report by Kleimann Communication Group summarizing consumer research commissioned by the regulators as part of their ongoing efforts to develop improved financial privacy notices.The report's release concludes the first phase of an interagency project by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Trade Commission, the National Credit Union Administration, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Securities and Exchange Commission to explore alternatives for financial privacy notices that would be easier for consumers to read, understand, and use than many of the notices consumers currently receive from financial institutions. These six agencies were among those that jointly issued regulations in 2000 implementing the financial privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, but survey data indicate that many consumers neither read nor understand the notices financial institutions provide under those regulations.The report's findings indicate that it is possible for financial privacy notices to include all of the information required by law in a short document that consumers can readily understand. The report fully describes the extensive research that underlies these findings and the development of a prototype simplified privacy notice. Over a 12-month period, researchers conducted focus groups and in-depth individual interviews with consumers throughout the United States. Based on consumers' reactions to sample privacy notices, the researchers modified content and design to create notices in a tabular format that improved consumers' ability to read, understand, and use the notices, as well as to compare the information sharing practices of different financial institutions.The report concludes that consumers need a context for understanding information in financial privacy notices. The research shows that while there is a general awareness of information sharing practices, most consumers do not understand them. According to the report, consumers are overwhelmed by complex information, and simplification of financial privacy notices enhances consumers' ability to read the notices and make informed choices about the use of their personal information. The research also demonstrates that consumers more easily understand the important information in the notice when good design reinforces the content.The six agencies, together with the Office of Thrift Supervision, will fund a second phase of the project, to be contracted separately. This research will involve interviewing a much larger group of consumers throughout the United States to measure the effectiveness of the prototype and other examples of notices. The agencies have deferred consideration of policy action with respect to financial privacy notices until the next phase of consumer testing is completed. At that time, the agencies expect to consider a full range of options for improving financial privacy notices in light of all their consumer research.The agencies' efforts to improve these notices complement efforts to improve the effectiveness of privacy notices worldwide, as well as other government efforts to improve financial literacy."

728,3/30/2006,"An interagency notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR) that would implement Basel II risk-based capital requirements in the United States for large, internationally active banking organizations was made public Thursday by the Federal Reserve Board.The proposed rule would require the largest internationally active banks to enhance the measurement and management of their risks, including credit risk and operational risk. It also would require these banks to have rigorous processes for assessing overall capital adequacy in relation to their total risk profile and to publicly disclose information regarding their risk profile and capital adequacy.""Given the increasing complexity of the activities at our largest banks, and the related risks of those activities, I fully support efforts to develop a more appropriately risk-sensitive capital framework for those institutions,"" said Board Chairman Ben S. Bernanke. ""The current Basel I framework has become increasingly inadequate for capturing the risks at large, complex U.S. banking organizations.""The NPR details the agencies' plan for implementing the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision's new capital accord (Basel II). For banks that meet qualifying criteria, the NPR would replace U.S. rules implementing the Basel Capital Accord of 1988 (Basel I).The NPR builds on an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR) issued by the agencies in August 2003. It includes a number of prudential safeguards, including the requirement that a bank satisfactorily complete a four-quarter parallel run period, beginning no sooner than January 1, 2008, before operating under the Basel II framework. Following a successful parallel run, a bank would have to progress through three transitional periods, each of at least one year, during which there would be temporary floors on potential declines in risk-based capital requirements. A bank would need approval from its primary federal supervisor to move to each of the transitional floors, and at the end of the transition period to move to full Basel II.""As a central bank and a supervisor of banks and bank and financial holding companies, the Federal Reserve is committed to ensuring that the Basel II framework delivers a strong and risk-sensitive base of capital,"" said Governor Susan S. Bies. ""That is why the proposal contains safeguards to ensure strong capital levels during and after the transition to Basel II, and why we will remain vigilant in monitoring Basel II's impact on an ongoing basis.""The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) also are considering the NPR. The Board authorized the staff to publish the NPR in the Federal Register for public comment after the other agencies complete their approval processes.

730,3/28/2006,"The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 4-3/4 percent.The slowing of the growth of real GDP in the fourth quarter of 2005 seems largely to have reflected temporary or special factors. Economic growth has rebounded strongly in the current quarter but appears likely to moderate to a more sustainable pace. As yet, the run-up in the prices of energy and other commodities appears to have had only a modest effect on core inflation, ongoing productivity gains have helped to hold the growth of unit labor costs in check, and inflation expectations remain contained. Still, possible increases in resource utilization, in combination with the elevated prices of energy and other commodities, have the potential to add to inflation pressures.The Committee judges that some further policy firming may be needed to keep the risks to the attainment of both sustainable economic growth and price stability roughly in balance. In any event, the Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to foster these objectives.Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S. Bernanke, Chairman; Timothy F. Geithner, Vice Chairman; Susan S. Bies; Jack Guynn; Donald L. Kohn; Randall S. Kroszner; Jeffrey M. Lacker; Mark W. Olson; Sandra Pianalto; Kevin M. Warsh; and Janet L.

742,3/17/2006,"The Federal Reserve Board on Friday announced the approval of policy changes that seek to reduce the overuse of Federal Reserve Bank cash-processing services by providing incentives for depository institutions to recirculate currency among their customers. The Reserve Banks estimate that the changes to the cash services policy could affect approximately 150 to 225 depository institutions with high-volume currency operations.The changes are intended to reverse a shift by depository institutions away from traditional patterns of currency activity toward greater reliance on Reserve Bank cash processing. The Federal Reserve expects depository institutions to recirculate to their customers fit currency deposited with them and to deposit only excess or unfit currency with Federal Reserve Banks. To promote the recirculation of fit Federal Reserve notes by depository institutions, two elements have been added to the existing cash services policy. First, a custodial inventory program will permit depository institutions to transfer a percentage of the $10 and $20 notes in their vaults to the books of the Federal Reserve, allowing the institutions to reduce the size and frequency of their deposits of currency to and orders from the Reserve Banks. This incentive will be coupled with a fee charged to depository institutions that deposit fit $10 or $20 notes at a Reserve Bank and order the same denomination, above a de minimis amount, during the same business week.The Reserve Banks will put the policy changes into effect in two phases. In the first phase, the custodial inventory program will be implemented for eligible participants. About one year later, in the second phase, the Reserve Banks will begin assessing the recirculation fee after they have put in place a currency quality policy to prevent deterioration in the quality of currency in circulation.The Reserve Banks expect to begin accepting requests to participate in the custodial inventory program in May 2006, with program operations beginning in July 2006. The assessment of fees is expected to begin in July 2007.Additional information about implementation of the policy changes will be published soon on the Federal Reserve Financial Services web site, http://www.frbservices.org/Cash.The Board's notice is attached."

744,3/15/2006,"The Federal Reserve Board on Wednesday announced its approval of a final rule to amend Regulation K to require Edge and Agreement corporations and U.S. branches, agencies, and other offices of foreign banks supervised by the Board to establish and maintain procedures reasonably designed to ensure and monitor compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act and related regulations.The Board will publish its final rule in the Federal Register shortly, and the rule will become effective 30 days after publication.The Bank Secrecy Act generally requires a financial institution doing business in the United States to keep records and make reports that have a high degree of usefulness in criminal, tax, or regulatory proceedings. Domestic financial institutions, such as state member banks subject to the Board's Regulation H, already have been required to establish and maintain programs to ensure and monitor compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act. The Board's final rule amends Regulation K to require Edge and Agreement corporations and U.S. branches, agencies, and other offices of foreign banks to implement and maintain similar compliance programs.The Board's final rule is consistent with regulations issued by the Department of the Treasury under section 352 of the USA PATRIOT Act, which requires all financial institutions to maintain effective anti-money-laundering programs. The Board believes that the final rule will not impose any material administrative burden for affected institutions because, in supervising these institutions to ensure safety and soundness, the Board has consistently expected such entities to maintain programs to ensure compliance with all applicable provisions of the Bank Secrecy Act.The Board's final rule is attached.Attachment (44KB PDF)"

The guidance allows for extensions of this period in unusual cases, and the agencies plan to substantially extend the time periods in the Gulf Coast areas hit by hurricanes Rita and Katrina.The guidance also addresses the availability of CRA ""community development"" consideration for bank activities that revitalize or stabilize underserved or distressed middle-income rural areas. The other major issue it addresses is implementation of the new community development test for banks with assets between $250 million and $1 billion.The guidance, which takes the form of questions and answers, was proposed for public comment on November 10, 2005. Some of the questions and answers have been revised from the proposal to reflect suggestions from commenters.The guidance is being issued by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. The guidance implements changes to the agencies' CRA regulations that took effect on September 1, 2005. The guidance will be effective upon publication in the Federal Register, which is expected shortly.

Because small BHCs may, consistent with the policy statement, operate at a level of leverage that generally is inconsistent with the capital guidelines, the capital guidelines provide an exemption for small BHCs.In its revisions to the Policy Statement, the Board has raised the small BHC asset size threshold from $150 million to $500 million and amended the related qualitative criteria for determining eligibility as a small BHC for the purposes of the policy statement and the capital guidelines. The amendments to the threshold and the qualitative criteria are designed to reflect changes in the industry since the initial issuance of the policy statement in 1980. The final rule is substantially similar to the proposed rule issued in September 2005 and takes effect 30 days after publication in the Federal Register.The Board has also clarified the treatment of subordinated debt associated with issuances of trust preferred securities. The revised policy statement indicates that such subordinated debt is considered debt for most purposes under the policy statement, subject to a five-year transition period.In the near term, the Board will be issuing a separate notice on related changes made to its regulatory financial reporting requirements. Under the revised regulatory financial reporting requirements, qualifying small BHCs will only be required to file parent-only financial data on a semi-annual basis (FR Y-9SP).The Board's notice is attached.

The final rule is substantially similar to the interim rule, but broadens its application so that securities borrowing transactions that would not be eligible for certain exemptions from U.S. federal bankruptcy or receivership law may qualify for the beneficial risk-based capital treatment provided certain operational and legal conditions are met.The Federal Reserve will not object if banking organizations apply the treatment set forth in the final rule in their fourth quarter 2005 regulatory reports.The final rule is pending approval by other federal banking regulators and would take effect upon its publication in the Federal Register.

The agencies’ primary concern is that limiting the liability of external auditors in engagement letters may reduce the reliability of audits.The Interagency Advisory on the Unsafe and Unsound Use of Limitation of Liability Provisions in External Audit Engagement Letters informs financial institutions that they should not enter into external audit engagement letters that incorporate unsafe and unsound limitation of liability provisions with respect to audits of financial statements and internal control over financial reporting. Generally, this includes provisions that: (1) indemnify the external auditor against claims made by third parties (including punitive damages); (2) hold harmless or release the external auditor from liability for claims or potential claims that might be asserted by the client financial institution; or (3) limit the remedies available to the client financial institution. The advisory does not treat provisions that waive the right of financial institutions to seek punitive damages against their external auditors as unsafe and unsound.The advisory is effective for audit engagement letters executed on or after the date it is published in the Federal Register. The advisory does not apply to previously executed engagement letters. Nevertheless, the agencies encourage any financial institution subject to a multi-year audit engagement letter containing unsafe and unsound limitation of liability provisions to seek to amend its engagement letter to be consistent with the advisory for periods ending in 2007 or later.The agencies may take appropriate supervisory action if unsafe and unsound limitation of liability provisions are included in external audit engagement letters executed on or after the date the advisory is published in the Federal Register.

For these options to be considered, however, it is essential that the borrower contact his or her lender.The federal financial agencies continue to work to meet the needs of federally insured depository institutions and their customers. Additional guidance is available at the Federal Financial Institution Examination Council's web site (http://www.ffiec.gov).The public service announcements (PSAs) are being distributed to print and radio media outlets with the highest concentrations of people affected by the hurricane.

787,1/10/2006,"The federal bank and thrift regulatory agencies on Tuesday issued for comment proposed guidance on sound risk management practices for concentrations in commercial real estate lending.The agencies have observed that some institutions have high and increasing concentrations of commercial real estate loans where repayment primarily is dependent on rental income or from the proceeds of the sale, refinancing, or permanent financing of the property. Such concentrations may expose institutions to unanticipated earnings and capital volatility in the event of adverse changes in the general commercial real estate market.The proposed guidance--from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Office of Thrift Supervision--reinforces existing guidelines for real estate lending and safety and soundness. It provides criteria for identifying institutions with commercial real estate loan concentrations that may warrant greater supervisory scrutiny. As provided in the guidance, such institutions should have robust risk-management systems in place and capital levels higher than the regulatory minimums and appropriate to the risk associated with these concentrations.Comments are requested on all aspects of the guidance and are due 60 days after publication in the Federal Register, expected shortly. The guidance is attached.Attachment (84 KB PDF) Note: Comment period has been extended to April 13, 2006.
