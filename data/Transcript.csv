I don't know whether you have standing, but I willaccept your second in any event. We have an official second, thank you. Without objection.We have a significant and controversial issue next, the selection of the Manager of theSystem Open Market Account. The incumbent, Peter Fisher, has been nothing short of superb,and I say that despite the fact that I pick on him at every meeting and that is my most interestingand enjoyable FOMC activity. Would somebody like to move Peter?MS. RIVLIN. I nominate Peter.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Is there a second?SPEAKER(?). Second.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Without objection. Peter, having been duly elected tooffice, you now have to work. You are on.MR. FISHER. Thank you. The next topic on your agenda is the review of theAuthorization for Domestic Open Market Operations. I do not have any changes to request atthis time, but I did want to use this occasion to bring you up to date on three issues.The first is a preview of coming attractions. Following the Committee's discussion inSeptember of the maturity structure of the SOMA portfolio, we have continued to work both ontrying to articulate a set of principles that could guide the management of the SOMA portfolioand to develop some concrete alternative portfolio structures that illustrate different mechanisms"
1,19970325,"3/25/97CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. It has been moved. Is there a second?MR. KELLEY. Second.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. There is a second. Without objection. Thank youall. Let's move on with record speed to Mr. Prell.MR. PRELL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [Statement--see Appendix.]CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Questions for Mike?MR. PARRY. Mike, I was a little uncertain as to the wealth effects on consumerspending in the Greenbook forecast. I had the impression that there certainly was an impactfrom higher equity prices in particular, but in the Monday staff briefing to the Board, youseemed to be saying that there was not much of an effect. Would you go into that a little,please?MR. PRELL. On our interpretation, there probably has been some positive effecton consumption over the past year or so from the increase in financial wealth. Setting asidemeasurement problems, that effect likely has in reality been offset at least to some degree byan increased propensity to save based on concerns about retirement income and for otherprecautionary reasons. Going forward, we would interpret our forecast as continuing toincorporate some positive wealth effect, but again with these other factors tending to balancethat. Because we have assumed that the stock market tops out as we move into the latter partof this year and then declines noticeably in 1998, the wealth-to-income ratio falls back aconsiderable distance toward where it was several years ago. That tends to diminish thewealth effect as we move out in 1998. Another factor to keep in mind is that we have had asurge in income growth over the past year or so. It would be natural, given a permanentincome view, for spending to lag a bit and for the saving rate, all other things equal, to edge3/25/97up a bit. As income decelerates over the next year or so, we might still be getting someadjustment in consumption that would then tend to result in the saving rate edging lower. So,we see a number of counteracting forces that we have tried, at least judgmentally, to balancein a sensible way in the forecast.MR. PARRY. Thank you.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Minehan.MS. MINEHAN. I noticed that you built into your forecast for 1998 an increase of75 to 100 basis points in the federal funds rate.MR. PRELL. 75 basis points.MS. MINEHAN. I gather from the wording of the Greenbook and your briefingthat that was basically to keep real interest rates stable. But I wondered why you were doingthat. At least in my memory, it was a change from earlier Greenbook practices, and I wouldfind it helpful to have your comments on this. Of course, we can see in your alternativeprojections what the effects are if you do not change the federal funds rate assumption.MR. PRELL. We felt quite uneasy about what kind of message the forecast wouldconvey had we retained the assumption of a flat nominal funds rate. We perceived that theunderlying strength of demand has been greater than we expected. Extrapolating that tosome degree, it exacerbates what we already saw as a fundamental instability. I think thiswas highlighted in some of the longer-run simulations in the last Bluebook, where westretched the projections out a bit. Perhaps it became clearer to you there that what weforesaw with unchanged nominal interest rates was in essence a path where resourceutilization was going to continue to be well above sustainable levels. Following up on thatanalysis, we thought that the assumed uptilt in the funds rate would be a natural way to3/25/97indicate that at some point nominal interest rates probably would have to rise to avoidexcessive stimulus. We built in something that is on a par with what is happening to the coreCPI and to some of the broader GDP-related price measures.MS. MINEHAN. I certainly do not object to that approach as a forecast. It clearlyis in line with a lot of major forecasts. But I thought the whole point of doing theGreenbook, at least the way we have been doing it, was to have something that shows whathappens if we do not change anything.MR. PRELL. For all practical purposes the assumed rise in the funds rate istantamount in terms of the economic outcome to your not doing anything over the period1997 and 1998.MS. MINEHAN. True.MR. PRELL. But I thought it might be a useful signal here of what we nowperceive to be the longer-term unsustainability of the scenario that we have been drawing inprior Greenbooks.MS. MINEHAN. Thank you.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Parry.MR. PARRY. I think it was useful to get those alternatives, but which of thealternatives do you think would be most closely aligned with an opportunistic approach?MR. PRELL. I guess it is a matter of interpretation as to what the opportunisticapproach entails. If it entails making sure that the inflation rate does not move above therecent range, then our forecast implies that a policy move is necessary at some point.Whether that means a relatively aggressive approach or something that involves a continued""wait and see"" stance and moving later, I don't think we can readily discern. But the fact is"
2,19970520,"5/20/97intervention by the Bank of Thailand and other Asian central banks.- I will try to be pithyabout this. I think the simplest example is to take the Hong Kong dollar but only as ahypothetical case; that currency did not come under much pressure in this period. As youknow, Hong Kong runs a peg to the U.S. dollar. If $20 billion, for example, moves fromHong Kong to Japan and the peg is maintained, the one thing that we know will happen isthat the dollar will go down against the yen. Now, if we extrapolate that to Thailand just forpurposes of an example, that country runs a peg against a currency index in which the dollarhas a roughly 80 percent weight. When the Thai authorities defend their currency, fundsflow out of Thailand to repay leveraged financing in Tokyo. Thailand defends the baht byselling dollars either spot or forward, and the net effect shows up in dollar/yen movements tothe extent that the Thai authorities are successful in maintaining their peg to their index,which they have so far. So, I think the dollar/yen was affected to a significant extent bysome of the intervention in defense of Asian currencies and other currencies in this period. Itwas not a direct effect.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Since we know the particular days when the dollarwas under real tension, and I presume that we at least had the benefit of some judgment frommarket sources, if not officially, as to when a lot of the intervention and related movementsof funds was occurring, can we trace such intervention to the actual days in which the dollarwas particularly weak against the yen?MR. FISHER. Yes, the dollar's weakness occurred on the days when the Bank ofThailand initially intervened in size, May 6 and 7, but not so much in the days that followed.May 6 and 7 were days when the Bank of Thailand's defense of its currency was buildingup, although there were indications that they had been defending their currency for a while5/20/97on a modest scale. It was at the start of that week of May 5 to 9 that Thailand announcedsome disappointing forecasts for its budget and economic growth for the coming year.Pressures began to build on their currency, and the exchange market activities were thoughtto be related to that.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. It doesn't necessarily have to happen immediately.MR. FISHER. No, no.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. What happens is that portfolio adjustments start tocascade--MR. FISHER. Yes, precisely.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. And it takes a few days at least for that to work itsway through. A lot of it is essentially automatic because individuals have no particular desireto sell dollar holdings, but they end up with a maldistribution to which they have to adjust,and that is what has been happening. Governor Rivlin.MS. RIVLIN. Peter, what do you think you learned from the April surprisesaffecting the federal funds rate, or what do you think you need to learn before next April?MR. FISHER. That we all need to go back to the drawing board on forecastingtaxes, and I will not pretend to be the expert on that subject. I think our projection problemswere universal--New York, the Board, and the Treasury. None of us had it right. Mike Prellmay be able to offer more insights into this than I. Such a study clearly will require a majoreffort. We had some rather big surprises last year, and to be candid we thought we hadlearned from them. So, that is a major area for study.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Do we have sufficient regional data to help uslocate as we go along where an excess Treasury balance is coming from?5/20/97MR. FISHER. No, we do not. There is a rather disappointing inability to take theTreasury tax information and quickly derive statistics that we would find useful.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. We have daily information on some regionalcharacteristics of the tax receipts, and we know from the statistics of income where there arebig capital-gains taxpayers and what may change. Has anyone been able to infer anythingfrom the regional pattern?MR. PRELL. I am not aware that anyone has tried that; it is an interesting idea. Itsounds like a lot of work.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Big Blue could do it. [Laughter]MR. PRELL. I am not sure that we have that much free computer space rightnow! We can check into it.MR. FISHER. The other part of your question, Governor Rivlin--or the other partof my answer--is that I was very pleased that our announcing the quantity of RPs helped themarket get a quicker handle on how far off we all were on our forecasts, and that I think wasa help. We did operate twice in one day on two occasions. That was not to fine-tune therates but because of the paucity of propositions we had from the dealers and how far off wewere going to be unless we tried to add some reserves by going back into the market. I thinkthe dealer community responded rather well to that in terms of not thinking we were flyingoff the handle. The added flexibility to the Desk was helpful. I think the tools worked fairlywell. The first time we had a big miss in propositions, it did occur to me that it might be niceto be able to do foreign exchange swaps to inject reserves when there was a paucity ofcollateral. I don't think it was really necessary, but that thought at least crossed my mind.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Parry."
3,19970702,"7/1-2/97Could you elaborate on that in terms of whether that paper will be a discussion memorandum ora decision-oriented memorandum. Where are you on that issue?MR. FISHER. I would be happy to refer to Don and his staff on that.MR. KOHN. Board staff is working on a memorandum for Board consideration thatproposes a return to lagged reserve accounting. The Board has not seen any of this or heard thisdiscussed previously because we are still working on this issue at the staff level. I think there aretwo factors that make this a potentially opportune time to consider this issue. One is that asreserve balances have dropped, we have had increasing difficulties predicting required reservebalances from week to week. The reason is that vault cash has been high enough to enable somebanks to shift back and forth between being bound by reserve requirements and not. The previousformulas that were used to predict which banks were going to be bound and which were not nolonger work. We have tried to improve these predictions, and I think we have. The errors havedropped substantially, but it is still more difficult to make predictions about demands for reservebalances in an environment in which we cannot even be certain that one or another major largebank will be bound by reserve requirements. Secondly, the Federal Reserve System is in theprocess of changing the programming and accounting regime for reserve requirements, and itwould be relatively easy to allow for a shift back to lagged reserve accounting once thatprogramming is completed. Previously, we were told that it would be a major undertaking to gointo the reserve accounting system and change it from contemporaneous to lagged accounting.The implementation of the new accounting system, which I think will occur about a year from7/1-2/97now, would be an opportune moment to shift back to lagged reserves. As I mentioned, we aregoing to come to the Board with a proposal on that.MR. BOEHNE. As you know, this is an issue that has been debated at length atvarious times. We have had both regimes. We had contemporaneous reserves before the late1960s, when we went to lagged reserve requirements. As we got into the monetary aggregatesapproach to policy, we shifted back to contemporaneous reserves. I think this is more than atechnical issue. It has implications for how monetary policy is implemented or the perception ofhow it is implemented. I hope that this will not be treated as just a technical issue. It ought to betalked about in the broader context of monetary policy rather than in terms of accountingchanges. It is a worthwhile debate to have, and we ought to have it in that broader context.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. When we get there, why don't we bring it to theCommittee as a subject for general discussion, presuming that something materializes out ofwhat the staff is working on at the moment?MR. BROADDUS. I agree very much with what Ed Boehne just said. It would seemto be especially appropriate to discuss that in a situation where it is possible that M2 may becoming back on track. Lagged reserve accounting precludes the use of any sort of reserveoperating instrument in my opinion, and such an instrument might be a more desirable option inthis kind of situation.MR. FISHER. I would underscore that the paper, particularly the decision tree thatshows the different options, is not intended to be technical or to bury this issue in the details.Don and I were trying to lay this out so you would see all the steps we think need to be gonethrough before you reach any of what we deem to be the important policy choices at the bottom7/1-2/97of the decision tree, as it were, and perhaps along the way. I hope no one looks at this paper astaking any of these issues and burying them. Rather, we are trying to let you see, with as muchadvance notice as we can give, the full scope of the possible changes that might be envisaged asa potential answer to the low operating balances problem.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I think President Broaddus is raising an interestingissue. If the M2 data eventually suggest that there may be some particular policy use for M2, thewhole concept of reserves in the structure of monetary operations, especially in the context of thesignificant decline in required reserves, will become more than a technical question. I think wewill have to be very careful about how that plays out. We do not want to start moving in onedirection and find that we have to backtrack because of factors we did not foresee. My guess isthat it would be very premature to consider the issue at this stage, but I would not rule out thepossibility that it may become a significant question in 6 months, 18 months; I do not knowprecisely when.MR. KOHN. As you and President Broaddus remember, the reserve requirements aregeared to Ml, and there are no reserve requirements on non-M1 deposit balances.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I think that is precisely the issue in the sense that if wego back to M2 and stay with reserves on transaction balances, something is incoherent. At themoment, it doesn't matter all that much. But it would if we began to take the M2 cone seriously.Any other questions?MR. MELZER. I have one. I agree with the general thrust of the views that have justbeen expressed. One of the options on the decision tree would be to lower reserve requirementsand increase the deposit base to which they apply. It would be exactly in that circumstance that I"
4,19970819,"8/19/97First, since your last meeting, there have been noteworthy shifts in theinterest rate outlook for the United States, Germany, and Japan. While eachof these movements may appear small, in perspective and in conjunctionthey can be understood as causing a significant increase in risk to whichmarket participants responded.Second, to my way of thinking, it is not helpful to view the dollar'smovement--or exchange rate movements generally--as ""causing"" the sell-off in bond and equity markets. The dollar's recent movements appear toreflect the same reassessment of the outlook that has affected other markets.Third, I think the recent volatility in markets can, in part, be attributedto the difficulty all market participants are having in coming to grips withthe extraordinary performance of the U.S. economy. In this sense, therecent volatility reflects the contest between ""old"" and ""new"" paradigms.Looking at the first page of charts, which depicts forward rateagreements and Euro-deposit rates from August 1996 for the dollar, themark, and the yen, you can see the backing up of the 9-by-12 dollar FRA--indicating three-month deposit rates, nine months forward--which occurredfollowing the August 1st release of the nonfarm payroll data and the NAPMsurvey. In the blue lines, you can see the consistent rise in German forwardrates from mid-July. At the bottom, you can see the recent, continueddecline in Japanese forward rates.The rally in U.S. interest rate markets, which started in the spring,continued in the last two weeks of July. That rally was propelled by thecombination of reduced expectations for any near-term Committee actionfollowing the Chairman's Humphrey-Hawkins testimony and expectationsfor reduced Treasury issuance as a consequence of the improved fiscaloutlook.The August 1st release of the nonfarm payroll and NAPM reportscaused a modest increase in expectations for a tightening by the Committeebefore year-end, with the December Fed funds futures backing up by 14basis points in six days. As you can see in the FRA chart, late last week thebackup in interest rates reversed at the time of the rapid decline in equitymarkets. But through last Wednesday's close, the 9-by-12 backed up by 32basis points in the nine trading days from July 31st.Looking back across the past year, this move is comparable to theincreases in the 9-by-12 that occurred in December and February. InDecember, beginning a few days before the Chairman's speech at theAmerican Enterprise Institute, the 9-by-12 backed up by 30 basis points inthirteen trading days; in response to the Chairman's Humphrey-Hawkins8/19/97testimony in February, the 9-by-12 backed up by 28 basis points in just sixtrading days.Trend reversals such as these, reflecting only a modest increase in theprobability of a tightening of monetary policy, also tend to cause marketparticipants to reassess the likely consequences of still seemingly remoteevents. Most market participants still think that an increase in rates by theCommittee is not likely to occur at this meeting or the next. But given thelofty levels to which bond and equity markets had traded, even a smallincrease in the likelihood of an event which could have such extreme,negative consequences for asset values causes traders to reduce theirexposures.To put the same thought differently: for those still working in the ""oldparadigm,"" uncertainty premia were squeezed awfully tight by the end ofJuly, when the two-year Treasury yield traded within 25 basis points of theFed funds target rate; some backup in interest rates and a collateral selloffin equities were accidents waiting to happen. In conjunction with thereversal of the U.S. rate outlook, after the mark began to weaken sharply inmid-July market participants also have had to respond to the escalatingrhetoric from Bundesbank officials threatening an increase in rates.On July 24th, the Bundesbank Council met and announced that theirrepo operations would continue at the fixed rate of 3 percent but only forthe first two weeks of their four-week holiday until the next Councilmeeting. This suggested that the Bundesbank Directorium would have theopportunity to change the repo rate by either moving to a variable ratetender or raising the fixed rate last week. However, they announced onemore operation at the fixed 3 percent rate last week, and this morning theyannounced one more operation at 3 percent.From the Bundesbank's perspective, this saber rattling has had twobeneficial effects: It has created a much greater sense of two-way risk in theDeutsche mark anditself in the pre-monetary union environment.Now, the Bundesbank faces something of a dilemma--or a couple ofdilemmas. First, the German economy is providing mixed signals: somemeasures of activity are picking up and, as a consequence of the decline inthe mark this year, officials expect import price inflation to begin to showup in the data. On the other hand, high unemployment continues; ongoingproblems in implementing tax reform suggest that consumption demandwill remain weak, and M3 growth continues to slow. Thus, on strictlydomestic grounds, a decision to increase rates would be finely balanced.8/19/97Second, it is not clear how markets would respond to a rate increase inthe context of European monetary union. To the extent that an increase inrates by the Bundesbank were to be perceived as hostile to the EMUprocess, causing delay or postponement or a narrowing of the field of likelymember countries, it might then be expected to cause the mark tostrengthen.However, much of the Bundesbank's rhetoric of the last few weeks hasbeen in service to the idea that an increase in rates would be consistent withand supportive of EMU, suggesting that European monetary policy shouldnot be frozen in place until the ECB is created and that the convergenceprocess could be completed by German rates rising to meet Italian rates.To the extent that market participants believe this, in the event that theBundesbank were to raise rates, it is not clear that German long-term rateswould move very much, or that the mark would appreciate much more thanit did last week.Japanese forward rates reflect the continued unwinding of expectationsfor any near-term firming by the Bank of Japan, particularly following theJuly 24th release of the Bank of Japan's Quarterly Report and the July 30threlease of weaker-than-expected June industrial production data. As youcan see at the bottom of the page, the rise in rates that occurred in May--inresponse to official pronouncements that things were not as bad as theyseemed--has now been completely reversed as market participants havecome to see the Japanese economy to be as weak as they originally feared.The 9-by-12 forward rate is now returning to the levels where it wastrading in March, at the end of the last Japanese fiscal year when gloomwas widespread. On August 15th and again today, the yield on thebenchmark No. 182 Japanese government bond hit a new, historic low of2.065 percent.Turning to the next page, a further jolt to the global outlook has comein the rush of currency devaluations in Southeast Asia. Over the course ofthe spring and summer, media attention has shifted back and forth betweendescribing these events as ""speculative attacks"" on the one hand and""competitive devaluations"" on the other. Increasingly, emphasis is nowplaced on the latter. While much of the focus has been on the devaluationof these currencies against the dollar, shown in the top panel, their declinesagainst the yen since May 1st have been even more impressive, which is notlikely to do much to improve the outlook for the Japanese export sector.Turning to the third page of charts--"
5,19970930,"9/30/97 2the current rate. The release of the 11.2 percent (annual rate) decline insecond-quarter GDP added to the gloom in Tokyo. Rather than try to parseout the green muddle of rates at the bottom of the chart, let me observe thatthe 9-month forward, 3-month yen deposit rate now trades at 3 basis pointsover the overnight Libor rate. The JGB benchmark yield has traded downto 1.86 percent in the last couple of days. These relative shifts in interestrate expectations have had a fairly predictable impact on exchange markets,with the yen depreciating about 2-1/2 percent and the mark appreciatingabout 5-1/2 percent against the dollar since August 1. I think this impact onthe dollar-mark exchange rate is precisely what the Bundesbank had inmind when it engineered its whisper campaign.Turning to the second page, you can see that recent developments had asomewhat more complex impact on bond markets. The four panels on thispage depict the basis-point changes since July 1 in 9-month forward3-month deposit rates implied by the FRAs and in 10-year governmentbond yields. In the upper left panel, you can see the story of U.S. interestrate markets as the red lines move across the chart. We had the rally in Julyfollowed by the upward spike in early August. There was little net changesubsequently until the more recent rally associated with the release of theAugust price data during September. In the top panel for Japan on the right,the persistent decline in Japanese rates, both for 10-year bonds and forwardinterest rate expectations, is evident. In the bottom left chart for Germany,we see a different pattern of interest rate movements throughout the period.The 9-month forward 3-month deposit rate has risen by 72 basis pointssince July 1, while the 10-year bond has traded more or less sideways; itrallied a little in September, declining 18 basis points in yield.The truly dramatic impact of the Bundesbank's whisper campaign wasfelt in Italian interest rate markets where participants heard the Bundesbankto be saying three things: First, the Bundesbank would be raising rates.Secondly, the Bundesbank was so convinced that Italy would be in EMUthat they were prepared to act on that basis. And third, the Bundesbankthought it would be an EMU-friendly act for the Bank of Italy to lower rates150 basis points. As shown in the panel at the bottom right, the 9-monthforward 3-month lira deposit rate declined by 125 basis points from thebeginning of August through last Friday and there was a similar decline inthe 10-year bond yield. One of the questions that have come out of thisexperience is how to explain the stability in long-term German interestrates. From Frankfurt, the markets have heard that when central banks withreal credibility threaten to raise rates, the long end of their yield curve9/30/97remains stable or rallies. And much to my surprise, a great number ofmarket participants have adopted this view as their own. There is analternative view to which I am somewhat partial. It begins by noting thatover the last several years the Bundesbank has been of the view that thelong end of their yield curve has followed the lead of the U.S. and theglobal bond markets, and it has not really followed expected changes inshort-term German interest rates. The pattern of the solid blue line forGermany does have some echo of the solid red line for the United States.One could also note that relative to U.S. and Japanese 10-year rates,German rates have backed up by 25 basis points since the beginning of thesummer. So, I think there is some excitement yet to play through inEuropean bond markets as we move forward toward EMU.The third page of charts shows percent changes in equity indices for thesecond and third quarters of 1997. I have included that chart to make twoobvious points. First, equity markets were somewhat more volatile in thethird quarter than in the second. Also, there was a much greater diversity ofoutcomes in the third quarter. That is true globally and also if we look atsome of the internal comparisons. For example, the NASDAQ performancewas quite different from that of the Dow. The Milan MlBtel, the GermanDax, and the French CAC all had quite different outcomes and, of course,the Tokyo Topix and its construction sector, reflecting the Japanesedomestic economy, also turned in rather different performances than otherequity indices.Turning to domestic open market operations, the daily effective federalfunds rate averaged about 5.55 percent over the intermeeting period, a littlehigher than the intended rate. This outcome reflected principally a fewdays of elevated funds rates. I'm not going to take you through all thedetail on these charts, but I did want to make a point. The vertical bluelines in the top panel show the daily range of federal funds trading; thehorizontal red lines are the daily effective rate; the vertical red linesrepresent one standard deviation in the volume of federal funds trading eachday and give a sense of the concentration or dispersion of funds trading.The middle panel shows our misses, that is, the actual level of free reservesless the intended level; the yellow bars indicate negative misses and theblue bars show positive misses. In the bottom panel, you see operatingbalances as they occurred each day.My reason for showing this chart is to focus on three days in Septemberon the right hand side of the page--the 15th, 16th, and 17th--and to point outthat neither changes in operating balances alone nor even our misses ofsome size really tell us everything we might want know about what drivesvolatility in the federal funds market. The 15th, 16th, and 17th werecorporate tax payment dates. On the 15th, you can see that we had anelevated effective rate on the day but a very narrow effective range, as9/30/97market participants priced up for the pressures they anticipated and tradedfunds in a very narrow range. However, looking at the middle panel for the15th, we had a rather sizable miss of $2 billion on that day. Even so, we hada relatively contained federal funds rate. On the 16th, the effective rate wasright on the target at 5-1/2 percent. The one standard deviation tradingrange was somewhat wider on that day, but we again had a miss and, if youlook at the bottom of the page, a very low operating balance. In fact, wealmost hit the historic low operating balance, but we did not have a terriblyvolatile day or upward pressure in the funds market. The next day, the 17th,funds traded over a quite wide range at rates up to 15 percent and the onestandard deviation volume of trading was much wider. We had a very largemiss and again a low operating balance.The difference between the 16th and the 17th was in the distribution ofreserves, with the need falling on the large regional banks whose behaviorpattern tends to be to bid up the funds rate. So in this case, the behavior ofthose banks determined the volatility of the funds rate a great deal morethan the level of operating balance or even the size of our miss. I do notwant to overstate that, but I think it is a significant point to emphasize. Thelevel of the operating balance is not the only factor.Since your last meeting, we have conducted two legs of outrightpurchase operations, both in the coupon sector. The bill market remainsquite tight, and I have been reluctant to enter that market. So, I expect tocontinue to operate in the coupon market. There is some possibility thatwith the new fiscal year the Treasury will be issuing a larger amount of billsand we will be able to return to bill purchases.Mr. Chairman, there were no foreign exchange operations for theSystem account during the period since the August meeting. I will need theCommittee's ratification of our domestic open market operations. I wouldbe happy to answer any questions.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Questions for Peter?MR. BROADDUS. A quick question, Peter. It seems to me that our key concern aboutintra-day funds rate volatility would be the possibility that we would give the wrong signal tomarkets. I have not had the sense that anything like that has been happening lately, but you mayhave a different impression.MR. FISHER. No, I do not. I think the market understands as well as any of us theimplications of low operating balances and how they may foster market volatility on some days."
6,19971112,"11/12/97people talked very seriously about how the tide had turned and interest ratescould be expected to go higher in the industrial world. Both in Germany andthe United States, rates continued to back up for several days until the eventsbeginning on October 23, a date I will come back to in a minute. That was theday when financial pressures first emerged most acutely in Hong Kong. Youcan see that interest rate expectations in both the United States and Germanycame off rather sharply beginning that Thursday, October 23, and bottomed outon the day of the sharpest U.S. equity market decline the following Monday,October 27. Forward rate markets were already stabilizing to some extent, atleast here, by the time of the Chairman's testimony before the Joint EconomicCommittee on October 29.I would like to note that U.S. interest rate expectations, as measured bythe forward rate agreements, did not subsequently back up. They stabilizedmore or less at levels slightly above the lows reached before the Chairman'sOctober 8 testimony, whereas German interest rate expectations, reflecting arise that occurred in market rates, are still quite a bit higher. I think this goesa long way toward explaining the relative movements in the dollar and themark. One does not need to look anywhere else even though many financialmarket analysts are looking under every rock and in every nook and cranny.You can see in the bottom panel that Japanese interest rates, as measured byforward rate agreements, are still quite flat. I will come back in a moment tosome events leading up to this morning's developments in Tokyo.Turning to the charts on page 2, I will focus on the causation of theevents in Hong Kong, or as the Chairman sometimes puts it, a discussion ofwho sneezed last. This discussion is not necessarily to point a finger atanyone but to delineate the series of events that led up to the financialpressures. The first panel shows the percent changes in the foreign exchangevalue of the Taiwan dollar, the South Korean won, and the Hong Kong dollarsince September 30. The middle panel shows 1-month interbank rates forTaiwan, South Korea, and Hong Kong, and the bottom panel shows percentchanges in key equity indices for those countries and for the United States,Japan, and Brazil.Working across the top panel--the Hong Kong government announcedin early October that they would hold another land auction. This is a more orless routine event for them, but the announcement did indicate they werecoming back to the market and would be putting some pressure on landprices. They held the auction several days later, on October 15, and found abogus bid for one of the largest parcels of land that were up for sale. Thebid was made by a woman in the name of a major firm and she certainly didnot have the billions of dollars necessary to purchase the real estate. The11/12/97Hong Kong authorities are reviewing their practices for accepting bids, but itwas rather shocking to think that an auction for this kind of real estate couldinvolve someone who was a mental patient, quite literally.Several days later, Taiwan ceased intervening in the exchange marketand allowed its currency to depreciate significantly. This posed a question inthe minds of many foreign exchange market participants the world over--aprofound question. If a country with such a high level of foreign exchangereserves was not prepared to defend its currency, who would? The Taiwangovernment certainly had the capacity to defend their exchange rate, but itturned out they did not have the will. The question in everyone's mind afterTaiwan's decision was whether the People's Republic of China, and not somuch Hong Kong, would need to devalue. For many people the answer tothat question appeared to come when, on October 23 or late in the evening ofOctober 22, the People's Bank of China announced a reduction in interestrates. They reduced their lending rate by 150 basis points and their savingsrate by a little more than 100 basis points. This appeared to answer thequestion for many people by showing that China was worried about theircompetitiveness. The markets very quickly tried to price that in, but theycould not price it into the yuan. The only place it can be priced is in a proxyfor the yuan, the Hong Kong dollar. So, the pressures began to build and youcan see in the middle column that the Hong Kong monetary authoritiessqueezed their money market rather tightly. I don't think they expectedovernight interest rates to go to 300 percent. They expected the rise to beconsiderably less than that, but there were a number of players who held ontolong positions hoping to make money in subsequent days. In the bottompanel, you can see them play through to the equity markets, with whoseperformance you are familiar.Turning to the third page of charts, I want to draw your attention to theimpact of these developments in credit markets. While equity markets hadsome sharp losses, the real fear and adjustment that took place in financialmarkets seemed to be, as I heard it, in the credit markets. In the first panel,you can see that absolute spreads of Asian Yankee and stripped Brady Bondsover U.S. Treasuries backed up rather considerably. These are measured inhundreds of basis points. The backup was more or less triggered by thepressures on October 23 and thereafter, obviously with many contributingevents. In the middle panel, in order to get the scaling right, I simply havethe basis point changes in two Merrill Lynch corporate bond indices, one forhigh yield and one for investment grade, over Treasuries since September 30.Clearly, there has been some widening of spreads over Treasuries. What isworth noting is that the corporate yields have not moved at all; it is theTreasuries that have moved. As shown in the bottom panel, 10- and 30-year11/12/97rates were down 20 basis points over this period, and that was the full extentof the backup, the widening of the spread if you will, both to junk andinvestment grade paper. It was very hard to chart in the bottom panel howodd the bond market has felt over the last few days because there has been atortuous back and forth between those who want to trade on fundamentalsand the flight to quality that seems to be taking place. I cannot show you lastFriday's developments in a chart because the adjustments happened soquickly. Following the release of the employment data last Friday, bondmarket and fed funds futures backed up and then, after about 90 seconds,came right back down as the market returned to its flight-to-credit posture.The fourth page displays three charts to make a very simple point.Each panel shows the percent changes in one of the G3 currencies against theother two G3 currencies. In the first panel, you can see that the mark hasappreciated against both the dollar and the yen since September 1. In themiddle panel, you can see that the yen has depreciated against both the dollarand the mark. And in the bottom panel, you can see that the dollar is beingpulled somewhat in two directions. That is, it is considerably weaker againstthe mark but a little stronger against the yen, the dollar having been stable formost of this period.I want to go back to what I referred to earlier, namely, that I thinkinterest rate differentials between the United States and Germany explainmost of the movement between the dollar and the mark, although marketparticipants do look eagerly at the question of whether there is a flight out ofdollars into marks and whether the mark is something of a safe haven. Ithink it is reasonable to pause and note that in terms of financial flows, thereprobably was some movement out of dollars, given how many of the assetsthat have been under pressure are dollar-denominated. So, when portfoliomanagers sustained losses on Bradys and Asian Yankees and equities that aremore or less dollar-linked, there was going to be some marginal movementout of the dollar. That is a very different question from one about themacroeconomic consequences; this is a financial flows issue. I think TedTruman will be coming back to the broader macroeconomic question.Let me pause here to discuss some of the events of the last few days inTokyo. The yen has weakened overnight; it was below 126 this morning.The Japanese government bond yield is up to 1.70 percent after backing up10 basis points in just a few days. A week ago, with the announcedbankruptcy of Sanyo, a very profound event happened in Japanese financialhistory: The authorities let a major firm go bankrupt. It is something ourcolleagues at the Bank of Japan have been working on earnestly for 10 yearsand are very proud of. Obviously, the timing was another matter. It took the"
7,19971216,"12/16/97the updrift in the solid line, the current dollar LIBOR, reflects a fairlytypical year-end phenomenon. I would not attach any significance to that.Looking at the German forward rates, Mr. Tietmeyer said ratherpublicly on November 14 what other Bundesbank officials have been sayingfor some time, namely, that the market should not expect German rates to goup by 120 basis points between now and next May to meet Italian rateshalfway, as the market had come to believe was going to happen. In effect,Tietmeyer was saying that the German economy is stronger but not really allthat strong. You can see the gentle drift downward in German forwardrates. If you look at the solid blue line, the current mark LIBOR, it is quiteinteresting that the spike in early December parallels the spike in the yenLIBOR, shown in the chart below, at the time of heightened concerns aboutthe Japanese premium. Now, this is interesting for those of us in the moneymarket business, as it were, because the calculations really are quitedifferent. In the British Bankers Association panel for the yen LIBORfixing, there are eight Japanese banks, whereas in the panels for the dollarand the mark, there are only three and the calculation is done by throwingout the highs and the lows. So, I think the spike in the German moneymarket rates reflects the demand for funds from the Japanese banks. It is nota reflection of the credit premium, as it were, from the demand side but apushing through of the demand coming from the Japanese banks.Turning to the Japanese market, we need a little magnification of thebottom panel to see what is going on in Japan. So, if you turn to the secondpage, I will work through some of the events in the Japanese markets.Three rates are traced in the top panel: the current yen LIBOR 3-monthdeposit fixing in dark purple, the 9-month forward 3-month yen deposit ratein orange-yellow, and the Japanese overnight call rate in green. In themiddle panel, we have plotted the excess reserves in the Japanese bankingsystem. I talked to Bank of Japan officials at some length about theircalculation of this measure. It is not quite how we would calculate it, but itis the way they do it. The chart illustrates the heightened generosity that theBank of Japan was practicing by leaving their market in considerablesurplus following the closure of Yamaichi and subsequently in the last fewdays. The bottom panel has two measures of the Japanese premium indollar interest rates: the solid line is the difference between the 1-monthLIBOR rates at the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi and at Chase, and the dottedline is the Fuji rate minus the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi rate. There wassome modest differentiation among Japanese names at the height of thecrisis, but clearly the dominant difference may be seen in the comparisonbetween the best Japanese name and Chase as shown in this example.12/16/97Going back to the top panel, I would like to draw out two points. Oneis that in the last few days the Bank of Japan has pushed the overnight callrate down into the 20 basis point range. A Bank of Japan official has toldme that ""you may call this a temporary easing."" I took that to mean that theemphasis was on ""you"" because they were not going to call it that out loudquite yet. But clearly, they have pushed the overnight call rate down. Thegap between the purple line showing the current LIBOR and the orange linedoes tend to indicate that the current premium is expected to wash out on theother side of the fiscal year. That is, the high premium, high demand forfunds coming out of the Japanese banks is thought by the market to besomething that will wash out 9-months forward when we get happily to theother side of the Japanese fiscal year-end in March.Turning to the third page, I thought I would give a little background onevents in East Asia. I know Ted Truman will be speaking more about that.The main purpose of these panels is to remind us that this is not just a badthunderstorm but something more like the 100-year flood. The top panelshows the exchange rate movements since July 1; the middle panel haspercent changes in equity indices; and the bottom panel depicts 1-monthinterest rates. Focusing on the currency panel, I think it's easy to say thatthe currencies have overshot their fundamental values. But I think it'simportant to recognize that there is still a very large position overhangweighing on these exchange markets. In effect, a leveraged convergencetrade as we would have called it in Europe a few years ago, short dollar oryen external currencies and long internal currencies, was embedded on thebalance sheets of businesses throughout the region, and they have not yetcompleted hedging those exposures. In these thin markets, both bankers andtraders have a very hard time thinking of these currencies as having overshotbecause they are aware of how much more there is yet to hedge that isweighing on the exchange rate.A second inference I would draw from this page is to note that thedownward slope of the foreign exchange and equity values is somewhatsteeper than the upward slope in the 1-month interest rates at the bottom.Another point I would note is that so far Taiwan, the red line, has managedto distinguish itself. In the top panel you can see that its currency hasdeclined against the dollar only slightly more than the yen; and in the middlepanel, you can see that their equity market has really broken out of the pack.While looking at this chart overall, I think it is possible that we will lookback and see that the end-of-year effect for some of these currencies andvalues provided something of a nadir for them, given the risk aversion thatis generally typical at this time of year. But I think it would be risky tocount on a bounceback after the New Year for all of them.12/16/97Turning to the fourth page, I have depicted in the top panel both theMarch Eurodollar contract and the March fed funds futures contract as theyhave traded throughout the fall. There is relatively little net change in boththose series from just prior to the November meeting to today. The middlepanel shows the U.S. Treasury constant maturity yields for 30, 10 and 2years. You can see that we have had a continued decline in bond yields inthe 30- and 10-year areas, while the yield on the 2-year note has been moreor less flat over that time horizon. Clearly, this is something that is quitedifficult to interpret. I think that with the worsening of the Asian crisis,market participants have inferred that there will be no action at this meeting,and more of them have come to adopt the deflationist outlook or at least aretaking it more seriously than they did some time ago. While point estimatesfor inflation have moved down a bit, I think the better explanation is thatmarket participants have shaved off the upside risk in the inflationprobability distribution, that is, the risk that inflation will rise over the nextsix months. That is what is tending to bring down the yield curve incombination with the flight-to-quality, end-of-year effect, making marketparticipants more comfortable about moving their duration out the yieldcurve in this end-of-year environment.The last page of charts relates to our open market operations in thisperiod. The top panel covers daily fed funds trading: the blue lines show thedaily ranges, the vertical red lines show the standard deviations, and thehorizontal red lines indicate the effective rates. The panel at the bottom hasthe level of free reserves and indicates our daily misses from the projections.I should point out that at the start of the middle period, which includedThanksgiving, we raised the allowance for excess reserves from $1 billion to$1.4 billion. The demand for excess reserves clearly has been inching up. Ido not want to suggest that this is a precise science, but we are trying to geta handle on how much it has drifted up. I think it will be some while beforewe are confident that we know where it has settled. We had some volatilityaround the Thanksgiving holiday and the start of December. As you cansee, excess reserves averaged around $2 billion in that period, and we stillhad a slightly firm funds rate. We may have slightly overcompensated atthe beginning of the current maintenance period, but the market was quitetight. Yesterday was a corporate tax payment date, and we tried to preparethe market for that.We purchased a total of $15.6 billion on an outright basis since the lastFOMC meeting and a total of $17.2 billion since early November. Thetotal included a small amount of bills, $1.5 billion, and those purchasesseemed to go quite well. I was trying to leave something of a marker withthe market and the Treasury--a notice that we were not forgetting about thebill sector, that we plan to come back to it. In making these permanent"

Peter, you are on again for yourreport on Desk operations.MR. FISHER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I will be referring to the three pagesof color charts that were placed in front of you before the meeting started. 1/The first page updates the charts I have shown before on current and forwardthree-month deposit rates. In this case, I am presenting a full 13 months of data soyou can see recent developments in the context of a longer period of time. If youlook at the top panel, shown in red, you can see the abrupt downward shift in U.S.forward rates that occurred right after the New Year. I think it is interesting thatnot much else has happened other than an abrupt move down. The forward ratesdo not show much of a rising rate environment or falling rate expectations. Theyare flat and right on top of one another after their downward shift, which I willcome back to in a minute. The flattening of the forward deposit rate curves reallybegan in late October when the Dow lost 554 points. It is quite dramatic how flat1/ Copies of the charts used by Mr. Fisher are appended to the transcript. (Appendix 1)"
9,19980331,"3/31/98Going over the summary, the first point is that the short-term andforward interest rate curves for the G-3 countries remain relatively flat.Second, I will be commenting that greed eclipses fear in asset markets,except in Japan. My third point will be that the flat forward pricing ofshort-term interest rates reflects, in my view, a ""clearing price"" fordivergent views about the direction of the Committee's next move, not aconviction about the likelihood of steady policy. If I am right about that,then there is something of a problem. Why hasn't the risk premiumassociated with this uncertainty been more evident in the Treasury yieldcurve? I offer two tentative answers to that. One is that, in general,expanding risk appetites have consumed the uncertainty for the moment.Secondly and more technically, reductions in Treasury supply both actualand anticipated, combined with the flat forward money market curverecently have been encouraging dealers to extend duration, and that hastended to flatten the Treasury yield curve. Finally, I will discuss Deskpreparations for the heavy tax inflows in April and May that will cause asharp rise in the Treasury balance and lead once again to a need for muchlarger operations than normal.Turning to the charts on page 2 that show current, 3-month forward,and 9-month forward deposit rates, you can see that these rates remainrelatively flat in all three charts. Only in Germany, the blue lines, is theremuch of a spread between the current 3-month rate and the 9-month forward3-month rate. In the chart for the United States, the red lines, you will notesee that forward rate expectations backed up following the Chairman'sHumphrey-Hawkins testimony, but they have not backed up to the levelswhere they closed at the end of last year.Looking at the chart for German rates, you can see that there continuesto be a wide spread between current and forward rates relative to thespreads for Japan and the United States. That spread reflects theanticipation that the European Central Bank, when it comes into existencenext January, probably will have a policy rate somewhere in the mid 3percent range; 3-1/2 percent is what most people in the market expect. TheBundesbank's current rate is 3.3 percent. Even with that in the background,I think the German economy and the European economies more generallyare perceived to be doing a bit better than they were earlier, and it isnoteworthy that both Finland and Norway raised their rates. So, if anything,the market has a sense of some upside risk to interest rates in Europe, evenif the potential increase is very moderate.Finally, in the bottom chart you can see that Japanese deposit rates,both current and forward, declined in February and March. This reflectssome decline in the Japanese bank premium. Unfortunately, this is not somuch the result of an improvement in the credit standing of the individualinstitutions but rather, in my view, a reassertion of the convoy system and3/31/98the implicit government guarantee behind the major Japanese banks. TheJapanese government simply will not let those banks fail, and that haspulled some of the risk premium out of the forward rate market.With that rather muted monetary policy outlook in the G-3 countries,the charts on the next page suggest in my view how greed has eclipsed fearin a number of the asset markets. In our written report, we detailed thatphenomenon across a number of individual markets. This is a quicksummary.On the left side, we have equity indices re-indexed to July 1, 1997, andtotal return bond indices for the United States, Germany, and Japan. Thered lines show the equity indices trading up from a 100 value on July 1 andthe blue lines indicate the total return on 10-year bond indices.On the right side, we have indexed the option implied volatility onequity and bond futures in the G-3 countries. We plotted the price of anoption and its implied volatility on each of the contracts, but they areindexed to place them on comparable terms, again with 100 on July 1, 1997.You can see that the upward shifts in volatility that occurred in October andNovember have been reversed, especially in U.S. and German equitymarkets.Generally speaking, you can see that financial asset prices in the UnitedStates and Germany have been consistently rising since the Novemberperiod and their volatilities consistently falling, although it is noteworthythat in the last few days there has been some uptick in the impliedvolatilities in both the United States and Germany.The bottom panel, of course, shows that Japan is quite a different story.You can see the poor performance of the Nikkei, but it did rally early thisyear, and total returns on Japanese government bonds have improved. Theauthorities were working quite hard over the last quarter to get the Nikkei toclose at the 18,000 level, an effort that did not succeed. On this index scale,89 would be equal to the 18,000 level. In Tokyo, they even invented a newterm for this effort. Traditionally, the market has referred to PKO, meaningprice keeping operations, where public pension funds and the like are usedto support equities. In the last month or so, they have relabeled these PLO,price lifting operations. As you can see, the Japanese authorities had theironly success in early January, and since then they have succeeded only inlifting the level of volatilities, illustrated on the right.I did not chart the last few days. With the failure of the Nikkei to closeat the 18,000 level at Japan's fiscal year-end, the markets are quite anxiousat this point. The yen has been weakening a bit, reflecting something of asense in the markets that the Japanese authorities are without a policy at this3/31/98point. While we hear that one more package is coming, it is not clear thatthe package is going to do anything for the financial sector, and the marketsare quite cynical about what is likely to happen.The next page provides another way of thinking about how riskappetites have been expanding. I return to a table that I showed to theCommittee last August in which I introduced the different philosophies offour characters in their search of a return in financial markets--the optimistsand pessimists under the old paradigm and the new paradigm.The top half of this table is identical in form to the one that I presentedto the Committee last August. It shows the old paradigm pessimist who isworried about an imminent breakout of inflation and the old paradigmoptimist who thinks inflation may be coming but the Fed may be able todelay it for a few quarters. We have the new paradigm optimist who thinksthe economy has entered a new era and he does not worry about inflation atall. We have the new paradigm pessimist who thinks that deflation is uponus. I introduced these four characters last August to help explain thevolatility we were then experiencing in the markets, including intradayvolatility, and these four characters were duking it out in the markets. Ireintroduce them here to show briefly how they would have fared to date.Had you run a portfolio consistent with the views of the old paradigmpessimist, shorting stocks and bonds as shown here at the bottom, youwould have been crushed, to put it bluntly. The new paradigm pessimist,who would have been short stocks and long bonds, would have done a littlebetter, but his positive return in bonds would not have come close tooffsetting his negative return in stocks.The two optimists would have done fairly well, obviously. The pointis, of course, that the pessimistic views, the skeptical views, have simplybeen priced out of this market and are not being reflected in theperformance of the market. If you were trying to manage money on thebasis of those views, you were stopped out long ago.Turning to the next page, I depict in the top panel three differenttrajectories of the implied yields on the fed funds futures contracts. Theblue line shows these yield trajectories at the time of the August meeting,the green line in early January, and the red line as of last Friday. My view,as I mentioned, is that the steady path of the fed funds rates implied bythese contracts reflects a clearing price among divergent views regardingthe direction of the Committee's next move.Forgive me if you saw it, but Friday's Wall Street Journal had a lovelyitem in it that summarized a recent poll of the 36 primary dealers. Itshowed that none expects the Fed to change interest rates at this meeting."
10,19980519,"5/19/98very modest uptrend since the nonfarm payroll release on April 3, whenforward expectations troughed. So, we have seen a gently rising trend sinceearly April, with a punctuation mark associated with the April 27 Wall StreetJournal story.Looking at the panel for Germany, you can see that forward rates had beendrifting up at the time of your last meeting and they did not stabilize until afterthe EU summit on May 1-3 at which the president and the board of theEuropean Central Bank were selected. That pattern is contrary to theexpectations of many observers in the market. I think the earlier updrift wasthe consequence of the same factors that I have been talking about for somemonths. These include the perception of slightly stronger-than-anticipatedgrowth in the German and other European economies that has been viewed asleading to a slightly higher probability that the Bundesbank might raise ratesbefore year-end or that the ECB might establish a slightly higher opening ratenext January than previously had been assumed.The Japanese rates are shown in the bottom panel. You can see that theannouncement of the stimulus package on April 9 and the foreign exchangeintervention on April 9 and 10 had little impact on the forward rates, with the9-month forward 3-month rate not moving at all on the announcement. I thinkthat is worthy of note. However, on May 7 Deputy Governor Yamaguchi of theBank of Japan commented that he saw more positive than negative effects froma rate reduction, and forward rates moved down a bit following his remarks.Turning to the next page, I hope the Committee will find it worthwhile tobear with me while I try to go through some of the different components andways of thinking about the Japan premium. I think this explanation might behelpful now. I will first go over the mechanics of the top three charts, and thendiscuss some issues and problems that come up. Let me say in advance that Iam presenting this to show you how skeptical I am that we really understandthe Japan premium phenomenon.The first panel shows a measure of the premium in dollar terms. It isexpressed as the spread between the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi's 1-monthLibor rate and Barclay's 1-month Libor rate. You can see that during the firstquarter of the year, from the start of the year to the end of the Japanese fiscalyear which also was the date of your last meeting, the premium averagedaround 20 basis points, though it moved around a bit. That is the measure ofthe premium that most people were talking about. Since the end of Japan'sfiscal year, it has moved down into the 9 to 10 basis point range.The second panel with the green line is a crude, but I think still useful,measure of the premium in yen terms, which is expressed as the spread between1-month Tibor and 1-month Libor. Tibor is the Tokyo interbank offer rate;Libor is the London rate. The Tokyo panel is made up almost exclusively of5/19/98Japanese banks. If you threw out the high and the low in that panel, youprobably would eliminate the 1 or 2 western banks that are in it, so it wouldbecome an exclusively Japanese panel. Libor is overwhelmingly non-Japanese.If you threw out more of the highs and the lows, you would end up throwingout all the Japanese names that usually operate in Libor. You would end upwith a measure of 1-month yen funding comprised mainly of non-Japanesebanks in London and Japanese banks in Tokyo. That spread is important tounderscore because it gives you a sense of the premium for the best Japanesenames. It covers only the banks that everyone thinks are implicitly guaranteedby the government, not the smaller more anonymous banks.The left-hand scale of the third panel measures the asset side of the Bank ofJapan's balance sheet. The shaded blue area depicts the growth of assets. Theright-hand scale refers to interest rates. The blue line is the overnight call rate;it recently has been mostly below the solid black line, which is the officialdiscount rate.Let me now go back over some of the issues that come up. First, it is worthnoting that both the dollar and the yen premiums have come down quite a bit inrecent days. It is quite noticeable that the dollar measure still indicates apremium in the 9 to 10 basis point range. One might ask whether this premiumshould be arbitraged out; it ought to be an easy thing to arbitrage away. But, ofcourse, an investor would have to take on the credit risk implicit in doingbusiness with Japanese names. What interests me is that when I talk tobankers, many of them will tell me very frankly that their credit lines to theirJapanese counterparties are completely full. That is, their traders are takingmaximum advantage of trying to capture this premium and arbitrage it. But thebank credit departments are now in charge on an individual trade-by-tradebasis, and they are up against their limits. With that in mind, I find it quiteimpressive that the spread is still only 9 to 10 basis points--that even with greedrestrained by credit departments, the spread is still in that neighborhood.If you look at the yen measure, you can see that the premium has beensqueezed down to 1 or 2 basis points at present. I believe it is important for usto ask whether we are looking at a single phenomenon that we can measureconsistently from last fall. When we talk to Bank of Japan officials, they pointto what they call the twin peaks of the premium--one prior to the calendar year-end and the other prior to the fiscal year-end. They view the premiumprincipally as a liquidity risk, not as a credit risk. I would note, however, thatthe first peak occurred in late November when we began to see closures ofJapanese financial institutions, bringing to mind a larger question of credit risk.Also, given the dubious quality of assets on the balance sheets of Japanesebanks, this does not seem to be a very useful time to be drawing a finedistinction between liquidity and credit risks. A Japanese bank that cannotfund itself is really a credit risk to me if I am a market counterparty.5/19/98The third panel shows the growth in the Bank of Japan's assets. In ourconversations, Bank of Japan officials explained what they were trying toaccomplish when they were aggressively expanding their balance sheet aroundcalendar year-end and fiscal year-end. By doing so through 1-month repos,they wanted to provide the market with a sense of confidence by injectingliquidity for a relatively long period. The growth of the asset side of theirbalance sheet depicted that. They are rather defensive about the low growth onthe liability side of their balance sheet because they say that various measuresthey have been publishing for a long time are misleading. They actually havebeen draining reserves at times by issuing their own bills. That is, they issuetheir own liability on one side as a Bank of Japan bill, but they also drainreserves. That is a swap on the liability side and not really growth in thebalance sheet. In any case, these transactions have not given me muchconfidence.I will offer you my own interpretation, my words not theirs. It seems to methat for the last six or seven months, they have been doing something of an""operation twist"" at the very short end of their yield curve. They have beenintervening in the 1-month interest rate area, pushing money out. Then,because they target the call rate and try to keep it in the neighborhood of theovernight discount rate, they have been draining funds out of the shorter end--overnight and for two or three days at a time--against the backdrop of theoverall expansion of their balance sheet. That leads me to the tentativeconclusion that when I look at the yen funding premium, I am not measuring asingle consistent phenomenon expressed on the demand side. That's because,overall, there has been a net increase on the supply side of the money market.But at the margin, it makes me even more nervous to think that they really havebeen price-targeting the 1-month interest rate to push it down while drainingfunds out overnight to try to keep the overnight call rate close to the overnightdiscount rate. If I am right about that, then interpreting the premium is evenmore complicated than I thought. I believe the risks of a sudden backup goingforward, if there is bad news, are even greater.The bottom panel is a place holder to show you widening corporate spreads,expressed in some Moody's indices that we found, over comparable Japanesegovernment securities. I think this panel is interesting for three reasons. First,many people talk about the fact that they cannot find deteriorating creditspreads in markets in Japan. They suggest that Japanese markets do not workthat way, that they are not Western, but we can see the deterioration quiteclearly in this chart. Secondly, these widening spreads are those of the banks'customers, and things are getting worse and worse for them. Finally, I think itis a useful reminder that we are approaching the Japanese bankruptcy season.The bankruptcies do not actually occur at the end of the fiscal year; they takeplace later when the fiscal year results have to be made public. Much the samething happened in November of last year when we began seeing reports of"
11,19980701,"6/30-7/1/98In the top panel for the U.S. dollar rates, you can see that most recently those rates have continued their gentle decline from their peak on April 27 at the time of the Wall Street Journal article. The decline was punctuated more recently by the market's reaction to the Chairman's testimony before the Joint Economic Committee on June 10. I will come back to that in a moment. That leaves the forward rates right on top of the current 3-month rates, which is the same state of affairs that exists in Japan, as you can see in the bottom panel.  If you look at German rates over the course of the year since the start of the Asian crisis--shown in the middle panel--your first impression may be that Europe has been going its own way. Rates rose in the second half of 1997 and maintained a bit more of a spread between current and forward rates in contrast to the dollar and yen rates. But on a second and closer look, I think one can see that since December 1997 German rates have tended to move in the same direction as U.S. rates; they declined in December and January, rose from mid-January to late April, and generally declined again from late April to the present. Their recent downdrift is attributed to the anticipation of a larger Asian effect on the European economy and therefore the perception of a reduced likelihood of rate rises over the remainder of the year from the NCBs in advance of the ECB taking over on January 1st. As this gentle downdrift has occurred in the last couple of weeks, the mark has weakened slightly against the dollar.  The bottom panel indicates that money market rates in Japan in general and the Japan premium in particular have backed up quite sharply in the past few days. The backup has occurred even though the Bank of Japan has been quite generous in its term operations in the 1- and 3-month areas, but they again have been draining shorter maturities measured in days and weeks.  The widening of the various measures of the Japan premium began about two weeks ago as Nippon and Long Term Credit Bank problems came to the surface. It is interesting that the widening accelerated from last Friday to Monday after the announcement that there might be a merger between Sumitomo Trust and Long Term Credit Bank.  Turning to the next page, there are three panels that I will first describe and then go over my thoughts about them. The first panel shows the dollar/yen in green with the scale on the right side and the dollar/mark in blue with the scale on the left side. The middle panel shows constant maturity U.S. Treasury yields of 2, 10, and 30 years. The bottom panel shows the currency values of seven currencies against the dollar. Those currencies are indexed to April 10, which was the date of the Bank of Japan's intervention operation in Tokyo. The Japanese yen is shown in green. The day before we had conducted a more modest intervention operation on their behalf.26/30-7/1/98Many market participants have observed an apparent correlation between the dollar/yen and various exchange rates and rates in other asset markets. Having observed this apparent correlation, which they date back to about April 10, many in the speculative community may have reinforced it through their own trading behavior in the expectation of making a profit.  That certainly has happened. But while most market participants are focused on the weakening yen as the cause of the recent correlated movements, I think we should not overlook the common thread of the strengthening dollar and the strengthening mark, which I have not graphed here, as capital flees the periphery and moves into core industrial countries.  In particular, it seems to me that over recent months, the dollar and dollar assets have been strengthening as U.S. economic data have come in close to expectations, though not so strong as to appear to require a policy tightening by the Committee. Indeed, the data have been just weak enough to avoid provoking a tightening but not so weak as to suggest that the end of the great expansion might be in sight. While I do not have similar charts for Germany, the same phenomenon has been occurring there, with the mark strengthening against the yen, equity markets reaching new highs, and Bund yields reaching new lows.  The Chairman's testimony on June 10 before the Joint Economic Committee, coming as it did in the midst of much anxiety about Japanese, Russian, Chinese, South African, and other asset markets, was perceived by the market as something of a neon sign announcing the good health of the U.S. economy in contrast to much of the rest of the world. In addition, because the Chairman appears to have been read in the market as being both on the lookout for inflationary pressures but also suggesting that a near-term tightening was not likely, investors took the testimony as a green light to buy Treasury coupon securities with minimal risk.  Our joint intervention on June 17, while providing something of a respite from the rush of markets in one direction, also in a sense proved the correlation hypothesis, at least to some people in the market. In any event, the strengthening of the yen provided some trading relief for many other asset markets. Overnight, we again had something of the same phenomenon. Today, official statements in Tokyo that made a permanent income tax cut seem more likely and suggested that one faction of the LDP might support the prime minister in his pursuit of a bridge bank concept gave the market a certain pause. In markets here at the quarter-end, a number of participants seemed to cash in their positions and take their profits home when they could. This induced something of a rally in the yen, which played through into other asset markets. I'm afraid that while there is a positive side to that, we should be aware of the likely risky side, namely that this episode seems once again to be confirming in the market's mind that everything is driven off the dollar/yen.36/30-7/1/98Turning to the last page and domestic open market operations, theaverage effective federal funds rate since your last meeting has been quiteclose to the target rate at 5.51 percent. But as you can see in the pattern offunds rate trading over the three maintenance periods, the daily effectiverates have tended to oscillate between slightly soft early in the periods andsomewhat firmer toward the end of the periods. You can see the slightdown/up, down/up pattern in the effective rates, the red horizontal lines.This is not quite how I think we should be going about meeting theCommittee's objective of an average rate. I would prefer to avoid theapparent instability that stems from having the market think of us as contentwith the oscillation of a negative autocorrelation pattern. I would rather thatthey think of us and anticipate our operations as being directed more towarda reversion to the mean. I do not yet entirely understand why we have hadthis problem of a soft market early in the maintenance periods. It maysimply be that we have switched back and forth from adding to drainingreserves as the needs worked out that way. It may also be that therecontinues to be some volatility in the pattern of major banks' participation inthe Treasury tax and loan accounts. Some of them raise and then cut theircapacity, and this is leading to some inherent instability in the market.In the last few days, markets have been anticipating the usualpronounced quarter-end tightness in the market. Today, federal funds aretrading above 6 percent as we thought they would, but this is a majorpayment day. We have tried to address the pressures. You can see thesoftish tone we gave the market yesterday in our effort to anticipate today'stightness. We have been trying to meet that as best we can.Mr. Chairman, I will need the Committee's ratification of our domesticoperations. Separately, I will need ratification of our June 17 foreignexchange intervention that I have previously described to the Committee.The System's share comes to $416.7 million. I would be happy to answerany questions members of the Committee might have.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Questions for Peter? President McTeer.MR. MCTEER. I gather you are saying that you object to movements up and downaround the target for the funds rate and you would like those movements to be tighter. Whyexactly is that?MR. FISHER. I don't want the market to think that if we allow federal funds to bevery soft at the beginning of the period, we will inevitably let the market be tight at the end of"
12,19980818,"8/18/98In the bottom panel in green, you can see that both the 3- and 9-month forward3-month rates in Japan dropped distinctly below the current 3-month rate followingthe selection of the new LDP leadership team, but those rates recently have bouncedback up a bit.As I look at the last 14 months of interest rate expectations in the leadingindustrial nations, two things strike me. First, the current trepidation in globalcapital markets is not a consequence of the perception that the leading central banksare about to do anything. There is no such expectation. Secondly, it strikes me howfar markets have come over the last 12 months in giving weight to the risks ofdeflation, however they imagine them to be. A year ago at your August meeting, Iintroduced my four characters in pursuit of a return, the old and the new paradigmpessimists and optimists. At the time I introduced the new paradigm pessimist whowas anxious about deflation and global capacity glut leading to competitivedevaluations, I think only Governor Kelley had a kind word to say about the newparadigm pessimist who he thought should not be overlooked.MS. RIVLIN. He is always nice. [Laughter]MR. FISHER. Today, at least as the market sees it, the nation with the secondlargest economy in the world, Japan, and the nation with the largest share of theworld's potential labor supply, China, are both experiencing distinctly falling prices.Moreover, the premier of China is no longer worrying about maintaining the pace ofinvestment in order to prevent inflationary bottlenecks. Instead, he is now talkingabout how China is trying to invest its way out of deflation. It is this context that Ithink we should keep in mind in our effort to understand how the markets arelooking at the question of whether China will devalue its currency. I think thatimplicitly this question is seen, rightly or wrongly, as representing something of aturning point for the markets--from a world they are familiar with to one they are lessfamiliar with, that is, a deflationary world.Turning to the second page of charts, on the left side are three panels showingforeign equity prices, German and U.S. equity prices, and German and U.S. 10- yearyields over the period from last July to the present. On the right hand side are threepanels depicting the same market movements since the beginning of July this year.Markets have gotten a little ahead of me since I prepared this chart, but let me focuson the right hand side first and make a point. I think we can see in retrospect that thecombination of the Chairman's Humphrey-Hawkins testimony this July and Mr.Obuchi's selection to lead the LDP were turning points for global marketexpectations. Now, I want to be very clear. In both cases, the outcomes were as themarket expected but not as the market hoped. Market participants were engaging, Ibelieve, in some wishful thinking, hoping to be pleasantly surprised.8/18/98With respect to the Humphrey-Hawkins testimony, the market was hoping thatthe Chairman would say something rather kind and benevolent. Instead, they heardhim say exactly what he said in June at his JEC testimony, namely that he was moreconcerned about the risks of inflation than those of deflation, and they heard himtestify with what might be characterized as a ""make no mistake about it"" delivery.With respect to the selection of the LDP leadership and the new Japanesegovernment, again the market was hoping to be pleasantly surprised, thinking thatperhaps the Japanese could find their own FDR. So far, it does not appear that theyhave. Thus, looking back, I think the market's two self-generated disappointmentscan be seen as the last sneezes on which the start of the recent equity market declinesmight be blamed.I do not have charts depicting some of the market movements in the last twodays that reflect the Russian devaluation. Let me just note that on Friday both theGerman bund market and our Treasury market experienced some extraordinaryinflows. There is still a flight to quality into both core Europe and the United States.The details are still coming out for the Russian devaluation and debt restructuringannounced yesterday. Market assessments are that the Russian program is better, atleast insofar as can be judged in the first day or so, than they might have feared.However, I think there is also a great deal of anxiety about how trades will be settled,and this is causing considerable market commotion. The ruble was fixed today at 6.8to the dollar, but it is trading around 7, at least in the interbank market. Butaccording to the reports that we have, the ruble is already trading around 9 in theblack market. I do not pretend to understand, and therefore I am not comfortableexplaining, how it is that the Dow thinks this is great news while the Bolsa and otheremerging equity markets think it is bad news. I think we will have to wait a few daysto see how this plays out.I would note that the devaluation of the Thai baht had looked pretty good on day2 also. I think we have quite a few risks ahead of us particularly in the days aheadwhen the collateral that has underpinned much of the leverage in the Russianfinancial markets starts to be liquidated as counterparties figure out what trades arebeing settled and what trades are not. There is still a great deal of uncertainty there,but I cannot pretend to be up to the minute on these developments.Turning to the third page, you will see three different charts that depict changesin dollar exchange rates since July 1997. In the top panel dollar exchange rates,indexed to last July, are shown against a number of currencies as well as the Bank ofEngland's trade-weighted dollar. In the middle panel dollar movements are shownagainst the yen and the mark. The changes are comparably scaled in the middlepanel. That is, given percentage changes for dollar/mark and dollar/yen are the sameon the chart and permit a comparison of how the dollar has moved against the yenvis-a-vis its movements against the mark. The bottom panel, again comparablyscaled, shows the movements of the yen against the mark since the beginning of July1997.8/18/98Given the dollar's movements indicated in the top panel, my point, Mr.Chairman, is that we are quite fortunate in my view that the world is not talkingabout too strong a dollar but rather is focusing its attention on too weak a yen. Thereare some reasons for our good fortune. Not the least is the fact that policy inertia ismost evident in Japan and that the yen is weak against both the dollar and the mark,as you can see in the bottom panels. The fact that the yen is weak against bothcurrencies has translated into a remarkably stable dollar-European currenciesrelationship over the last year and a half as evidenced by the green line in the middlepanel for dollar/mark. As I noted a moment ago, investments both in the last fewdays and over the last few months have been pouring out of emerging markets intocore markets. This flight to quality is what has made our 30-year yields so low andhas reduced German 10-year yields to below 4-1/2 percent. Because Europeanshistorically have been the loudest to complain about too strong or too weak a dollar, Ithink the relative stability of dollar/mark is obscuring the public's appreciation of thedollar's strength against a lot of other currencies. For example, we passed throughnew highs against the Mexican peso and the Canadian dollar.Another way to think about the strength of the dollar is to look at how stable thedollar/mark relationship has been and to realize that we are in the middle of theperiod in which, as I would have expected and we hear anecdotally, there aresignificant flows into Europe in anticipation of the creation of the euro. Those flowsare not going to occur in January after the euro is a fact, but people are trying toposition themselves in anticipation of its creation. Again, with bund yields at 41/2percent, we see that the bund seems to be the happy place to invest in anticipation ofa successful launch of the euro and also to hedge against its failure.Turning to the fourth page of charts, you can see in the top panel the SeptemberEurodollar futures contract as it has traded from May to the present and theNovember fed funds futures contract. I want to make two points here. First, you cansee the slight decline in yields in the last few days as expectations of an ease inpolicy, not immediately but in the future, have come into the market. What I think ismuch more noticeable in the top panel is how flat and boring these movements havebecome since your July meeting compared with what they were earlier in the spring.There is much less a sense of ""push me/pull you"" in the interest rate markets andexpectations have gone very flat without a lot of rate movement.The bottom two panels show something that I depicted several meetings ago,which is the positive carry of on-the-run Treasury issues. The on-the-run Treasuryyields are shown in the red dots and the blue dots represent the term-to-datefinancing for each of the on-the-run issues. The gap between the two gives somesense of the positive carry that the dealer community and leverage participants arestill experiencing in pricing on-the-run Treasury issues. I want to make clear that thegeneral collateral rate that applies to most Treasury securities is still close to thefunds rate, and therefore there is not as much positive carry for most off-the-run"
13,19980921,"because of transmission difficulties].CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Are we okay now?MS. MINEHAN. Yes, and could you go back over the last few comments you made?VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. We lost you just after you mentioned thewidening of spreads and the stock market.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Okay. With regard to the cost of capital, yields on lowergrade private debt securities are up while those on U.S. Treasuries have gone down as aconsequence of a flight to safety, and AAA yields are about unchanged. But on average privatesector debt yields have risen and obviously equity prices have gone down, so the cost of capital hasmoved up. When we filter recent developments through different models, or simply evaluate them,the conclusion is that the outlook for the immediate future has deteriorated. I think all of you arepicking up anecdotal evidence that is quite significant in that regard. We have picked up similarcomments at recent meetings here with business people. The members of the FAC wereparticularly gloomy at our recent meeting with them.Ordinarily in these circumstances I think we would have no difficulty going directly intothe next meeting scheduled for September 29 and essentially achieving the objective I discussedwith some of you at our August meeting in Jackson Hole, namely to find a way to hold our currentpolicy stance until that meeting and then act as a Committee rather than risk indicating a sense ofpanic or even any sense of disturbance, which would occur were we to move or have to move inadvance of the meeting itself.As a consequence of that, I tried to create some sense of movement in our thinking in myspeech at Berkeley on the 4th of this month and in my comments at the hearing of the HouseBanking Committee last Wednesday. I thought my remarks were generally consistent with the5objective and, if anything, moved a bit more toward expressing increased concern about theoutlook and possible need for a policy easing action. My remarks reflected my continuingconversations with a number of people. Unfortunately, some of my comments were misread whenI indicated in response to questions that there were no discussions going on with respect to theissue of a simultaneous, coordinated reduction of rates by central banks. Those comments hadnothing whatever to do with what the Committee might do on September 29, but regrettably thatnotion did not come through at all. Indeed, my response seems to have been taken as an indicationthat we were backtracking in some form or another.I am particularly concerned that given the international financial turmoil that continuesto increase, the general sense of persisting deterioration with no policy responses, and a widespreadperception of policy incoherence coming from the G-7 and others, that we could run into a majorproblem, especially given Japanese developments. As a consequence, I would feel morecomfortable if I were able to accept a standing invitation from the Senate Budget Committee toappear Wednesday afternoon along with Larry Summers essentially to review the internationalfinancial turmoil. I am concerned, however, about going up there unless I can signal evenindirectly that we may be moving next Tuesday, because that signal in and of itself will help tocontain any significant deterioration that might otherwise occur in the interim. I think theprobability of such deterioration over the next week is quite small, but its consequences are, ofcourse, extraordinarily important and could put the FOMC well behind the curve with respect totaking action. If I go up there--and I have not communicated yet to the Budget Committee that Iwill, and Larry Summers has indicated that if I accept he will likewise--I don't want to go up thereunless I have a sense from this Committee that it is all right to go ahead and signal even obliquelythat we will be moving the federal funds rate lower next Tuesday.6This is the purpose of this consultation and I would very much appreciate comments,insights, recommendations, wisdom from members of the Committee.VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Mr. Chairman, there is no question in my mindthat if this were September 29 I would be in favor of lowering the federal funds rate. I believe thatthe deterioration in markets, especially in credit markets last Thursday and Friday, and thecontinuation of that turmoil today all tell me that your accepting the invitation to appear onWednesday and in your inimitable fashion guiding the listeners there and in the markets toanticipate that we are likely to be moving on the 29th is something that is highly desirable. I agreewith you that the likelihood of significant further market deterioration in the near term is not high,but I think it is important enough for the members of the FOMC to endorse your giving that signalon Wednesday.MS. RIVLIN. This is Alice Rivlin, I strongly agree with what Bill McDonough justsaid. I had come to the conclusion myself that the case for moving the rate down on Tuesday wasvery strong, largely because of what is going on around the world. It is not such a strong casepurely domestically, but because there is also a significant, although we hope not anoverwhelming, possibility that things might move south in the interim, communicating somethingabout the possibility of a policy easing move is a good thing for the Chairman to do.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Cathy.MS. MINEHAN. I agree with what I heard both Alice Rivlin and Bill McDonough say.I do not believe things have to get worse for us to be inclined in the direction of moving. I thinkthey probably have gotten, if you will excuse the phrase, ""worse enough."" In that regard, I amwondering if you are still of the opinion that it would show a degree of panic if, for example, wewere to move this week as opposed to next week?"
14,19980929,"9/29/98language even further. For the symmetric alternative, I would say something like ""in view of thecurrently available evidence, the Committee believes that developments are equally likely towarrant a decrease or an increase in the federal funds rate."" If the decision were for a tilt, Iwould have the sentence say ""in view of the currently available evidence, the Committeebelieves that developments are more likely to warrant a decrease/increase than an increase/decrease in the federal funds rate."" I think that wording is understandable and straightforward.I also would like to see the minutes released even sooner than is contemplated in thismemo if that is physically possible. That's because, as I said the last time we discussed thismatter, the minutes provide context for the Committee's decision. If we are going to be moretransparent, sooner is better than later in that regard. I know there are physical limitationsinvolved in the production of the minutes.In sum, my preference would be to put simpler language in the directive, release itpromptly, and then publish the minutes as soon as we can to give context to our decision.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I gather by implication that we have concluded in ourprevious discussions that variations in wording to describe differing degrees of tilt have notserved us very well. As you know, in the past we have had hard tilts, medium tilts, tilted tilts,biased tilts, and who knows what else!MR. HOENIG. We need an interpreter to figure out what all that means. That is trueeven for us, let alone the public.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Guynn.MR. GUYNN. Mr. Chairman, I share Tom Hoenig's views pretty much down theline. I come to this, as I said last time, with a sense that the more information we can put outpromptly, the better. The more quickly markets react, the more the policy uncertainty premiums9/29/98that might otherwise get built into markets are reduced. So, I would favor both announcing thetilt immediately after each meeting and releasing the minutes sooner.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Tom, did you also say you favored releasing the tiltimmediately?MR. HOENIG. Yes, I would be in favor of releasing it promptly after each meetingwith the simpler, clearer language.MR. GUYNN. I think it is important as we continue this discussion to be sure that weall have the same objectives. In my view, the first and foremost objective is to make our intentclear. I think the staff does a really nice job on page 2 of their memo where they express theirsense of what we mean by the tilt, namely that it reflects the Committee's thinking about thebalance of risks. That is my current understanding of the primary reason for the tilt language. Ibelieve the secondary intent is to continue the practice of giving the Chairman the authority toact for the Committee in extraordinary circumstances. I assume those are the two things we aretrying to accomplish.I do not think that announcing the tilt would have a negative effect on the Committee'sdiscussion, although that is an issue raised in the staff memo. In fact, I would argue that it mighteven strengthen the discussion in that those who favored action at a meeting when none wastaken would at least have the benefit of the tilt being announced immediately, with whatevereffect that might have on the market. I also am satisfied that Fed watchers and others who payattention to the tilt are smart enough to realize that circumstances may change as events unfoldafter a meeting. Thus, they will not expect our next action always to be in the direction of a tilt.I also share Tom Hoenig's view on releasing the minutes. I assume that we should beable to publish the minutes sooner than a few days before the next meeting as suggested in thestaff memo. Since the minutes elaborate on the reasoning behind the tilt, I think the sooner we9/29/98release them, the better we are served. I also share Tom's preference for simpler language on thetilt, and I would incorporate the simpler language in the staff memo with the changes that Tomsuggested. I also would reword the lead sentence to indicate that the Committee seeks conditionsin reserve markets that are consistent with its mandate to foster longer-run price stability andsustained economic growth.Finally, I wonder whether we should consider dropping the last sentence of theoperating paragraph, which references growth in M2 and M3. That sentence may suggest thatthe Committee has those aggregates as a policy objective, and I question whether it is relevant interms of the way we currently conduct policy. However, this may be an issue that we don't wantto open at this time.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. As a central bank, we should at least recognize that M2and M3 exist, no matter what we do with them. [Laughter]MR. GUYNN. I accept that! Thank you, Mr. Chairman.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Minehan.MS. MINEHAN. I am very much in agreement with Presidents Hoenig and Guynn. Ifavor Option 1, prompt release after a meeting, and simpler language. I, too, tried to draftlanguage that would underscore the concept of risk to which both Tom and Jack seemed to bereferring. I also believe that the minutes should be released sooner than 2 or 3 days before thenext meeting, if that is at all possible.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Parry.MR. PARRY. I basically support what the three Presidents who preceded me saidabout making a prompt announcement, and I would release the operational paragraph when wechange the tilt. I have to say that I find the language in Option 2 relating to the tilt to besomewhat preferable to that in Option 1, though both certainly are better than what we have"
15,19981015,"10/15/98we had not foreseen. I think our sense is that the tenor of the markets is much more adverse toprivate borrowers than we had anticipated. If this were to persist for very much longer, I believethere would be a risk of undermining the momentum of private demand beyond what we hadforecast previously, and thus a softer economic outlook as we move into the first half of 1999.But we were very uncertain in our assessment last time of what the dimensions of the riskspreads would be, how soon they would narrow, how soon access to markets would be restored,and we are no less uncertain at this point. Clearly, that is a much more negative element of theeconomic picture at this juncture.Mr. Chairman, I think that is about all I can contribute at this point unless there are anyquestions.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Let us first move to Ted Truman. Do you have anyremarks you wish to make?MR. TRUMAN. I would note that, of course, we have no new real data on the externalsector. New trade data are coming out next week for August, which seems like a long time ago.The dollar has weakened, particularly against the yen. The positive news is that the weaknesshas also pulled up some of the other Asian currencies. I do not have a ready explanation for thedollar's weakness against the yen. It has weakened slightly against the European currencies.With regard to foreign economic activity, I would say that the information that has comein over the last few weeks has been consistent with what we were saying. That implies somesense of a catch-up, if I may put it that way, with the somewhat weaker outlook that we had inthe September Greenbook. There are nonetheless some small positive factors in my view. Thefact that the IMF legislation is likely to be enacted means that there is one less shoe to drop. We10/15/98got through the Brazilian elections. The Japanese have passed some banking bills, but no oneknows quite how they are going to implement those bills. And I think the recent internationalmeetings in Washington were somewhat of a reality check for our European friends.On the other hand, it is pretty clear that globally there is an increase in financial stresses.When we look at certain indicators of the kind that we look at for the U.S. economy--they are notas available abroad--they all show the same kinds of effects. Although Brazil is through itselections, it is not through the new economic program. There is a question about the implicationsof the German elections. The international policy complexion of the new government leavessome big question marks at this point. But I don't think anything has basically changed in ouroutlook. We had a weak outlook, and I think the downside risks are still there.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Don Kohn, would you like to add anything?MR. KOHN. Just to say that I think Mike Prell highlighted the key issue here, namelywhat is going on in credit markets, as I think President McDonough will be commenting on in afew minutes. There certainly has been more volatility, less liquidity, and less willingness to takerisks even since the Committee meeting only 2-1/2 weeks ago. The extent of the spillover into thecommercial banking sector is uncertain. We don't collect data often enough to know whetherbank spreads have risen, but we have had confirming data from other sources of the tightening oflending terms and conditions. Our Senior Loan Officers Survey for the period through the end ofSeptember provides evidence that some tightening has occurred, particularly for loans to largerbusinesses. I think what has happened here is that the banks have become increasingly reliant onthe securities markets to syndicate their loans and to manage their portfolios. As deteriorationoccurs in securities markets, it inevitably spills over into the banking sector, perhaps even morequickly than it might have 10 or 20 years ago.10/15/98In my view it is reasonable from a policy perspective to anticipate that financialconditions are likely to settle down over time in this country. We have seen some rather extrememovements in financial markets and an extreme lack of liquidity. But after financial conditionssettle down, they are likely to be noticeably tighter than they were a month or two ago, andmaybe even tighter than we thought they would be a week or two ago. Although they will settledown, I'm reasonably certain that lending terms and financial conditions will look tighter to a lotof borrowers, at least for a while.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Any questions for the three gentlemen?MR. POOLE. This is Bill Poole.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Yes.MR. POOLE. I was still on the highway, so I did not hear the PPI report. Can you giveme that number?MR. PRELL. The PPI for September was up 0.3 percent and its core component was up0.4 percent.MR. POOLE. Thank you.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Any further questions? Let us move on and I would like tocall on the Vice Chair to bring us up to date on what he sees in the financial markets around theworld and especially in New York, which is of particular interest. Bill.VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. What we are seeinghere in the financial markets in the United States, which certainly reflect financial conditionselsewhere, is a very dramatic increase in risk spreads. Let me give you some examples.The spread between the on-the-run 30-year Treasury bond and the most recently issuedTreasury bond before it, which normally runs at about 4 or 5 basis points, moved up after the"
16,19981117,"11/17/98wish to consider. The purpose of the latter is to pick up the possibility that after the Committeehas moved at a meeting, it may wish to reflect that fact in the wording of the tilt sentence. I haveindicated in the note on page 16 of the Bluebook how some presidents and one Board memberhave reacted to the proposed addition of a sentence in Option 2 concerning potential adjustmentsto policy during an intermeeting period. I think I should turn the discussion of Option 3 over toPresident Minehan, since it is her proposal.MS. MINEHAN. I would like to apologize to everyone because I really didn't meanto complicate needlessly or in any event to extend the discussion to yet another alternative.What I thought I was doing in responding to the request for possible rewording was to include areference to the balance of risks in the paragraph. On the basis of my notes at the Septembermeeting, that was an idea that Tom Hoenig brought up and that most of the members appeared toendorse. At least that is what my notes say. In any event, the inclusion of a reference to theCommittee's view of the balance of risks is the major difference in my alternative.I differentiate between the ""tilt"" and the ""no tilt"" language. In the ""no tilt"" language,there is an explicit reference to the Committee's perception of risks as being balanced at least forthe intermeeting period and a related belief that no change or a slight upward or downward movemight be equally likely. In the ""tilt"" language, the perceived balance of risks is not explicitlymentioned but is implicit in the Committee's adoption of an upside or a downside tilt. Also, Iwould agree with Presidents Boehne and Parry and with Governor Kelley with regard to thedesirability of dropping the next to last sentence in Option 2 that starts with ""Any potentialchanges...."" I don't think it is needed. I don't have any pride of authorship, but I do have somewarm and fuzzy feeling for the idea of mentioning the balance of risks in the directive.11/17/98CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I never heard anybody talk about risks as ""warm andfuzzy."" [Laughter] President Jordan.MR. JORDAN. Cathy, your alternative wording for a tilt in the directive refers toeconomic, financial, and monetary developments; that is fine. Option 2 talks about prospectivedevelopments, tilt or no tilt; that is fine as well. I am agreeable to talking about risks, but your""no tilt"" sentence refers to ""risks to the economic outlook."" That stopped me because it could beinterpreted to mean real growth rather than ""economic, financial, and monetary developments.""As we saw very recently, a variety of near-term risks may cause the Committee to do somethingthat may not translate in the view of every outsider as pertaining to the economic outlook.MS. MINEHAN. My intention was that the reference to the economic outlook wouldbe modified by the subsequent phrase about changes in ""economic, financial, and monetaryconditions"" so that the two expressions would be considered to be equivalent in the context ofthat sentence. But I see the problem that you're talking about.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Vice Chairman.VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Mr. Chairman, I understand the logic of Option3, but when we talk about risks to the forecast, we are engaging in internal Fedspeak. JerryJordan has picked up on the concern I would have about mentioning risks in this context, namelythat the average American would conclude that we thought economic growth was a risky thing.In popular use, it is a word that could get us into some trouble. So, I end up being verycomfortable with the alternative language of Option 2. With some amendments from TomHoenig to the earlier version, that option captures what we found reasonable at the last meeting. Ibelieve that even when we have no tilt, we need the disputed sentence, ""any potential changes inthe federal funds rate operating objective during the intermeeting period should be considered in11/17/98that context."" That sentence makes it clearer that the Chairman has the power--in fact there is noquestion about that in my view--and the good will of his colleagues on the Committee so that ifcircumstances in the intermeeting period should indicate the desirability of a change in policy, hecan implement the change. The courtesy that you have shown us, Mr. Chairman, at least in the5-1/2 years that I've been sitting here, has been such that I don't think there's the slightest worrythat that power would not be used wisely and well. So, I think it's very important that thesentence in question be retained.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Broaddus.MR. BROADDUS. Mr. Chairman, I think that either Option 2 or Option 3 would be asignificant improvement over what we have now. For the reasons that Jerry Jordan mentioned, Iwould have a preference for Option 2. In my view, it is a little more compact and a little clearer.I would agree with those who feel that we should remove the third sentence. If we do so, Iwould suggest a change at the end of the preceding sentence. Where there is a reference to ""thefederal funds rate in coming months,"" I would prefer to see the words ""in coming months""changed to ""in the intermeeting period."" That would make the period that we are talking about alittle more explicit and definite. Finally, if we can get the language changed, I hope we will thenmove on to the next and I think equally critical question of whether or not we will release thisinformation to the public shortly after the meeting at which the directive is set.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Boehne.MR. BOEHNE. I prefer Option 2. In my view, it captures what we have been talkingabout around the table. I would drop the sentence beginning with ""Any potential changes."" Myonly reason for suggesting its deletion is that I think it is basically redundant, though it issubstantively harmless. We need to have a Chairman who is fully effective. A fully effective"
17,19981222,"12/22/982000. So there's not much special pressure in German funding marketssurrounding the anticipation of the euro.In the bottom panel showing the Japanese rates, you can see that on thisscale, which is comparable to the top two panels, the deposit rates show abarely detectable rise. But, as small as it is here on this chart, by Japanesestandards this really is noticeable. Let me say that I think we have found toomany, rather than too few, explanations for this gentle backing up inJapanese money market rates: whether it's that the economy is expected tobottom out in the first half of the year or that the yields on Japanesegovernment bonds (JGBs) are backing up, as I will get to in a moment, orthat the Bank of Japan is not being quite so generous in its provision ofreserves. None of the explanations is entirely satisfactory to me, but thereclearly has been a gradual backup in Japanese money market rates.Turning to the second page, the three panels give something of a reviewof the last six months in financial markets. In the top panel, we have majorexchange rate pairs indexed to 100 as of July 1st.It shows marks per dollar,yen per mark, and yen per dollar, and their percentage change over the lastsix months.In the middle panel are the three major equity indices, also indexed toJuly 1st at 100. In the bottom panel, for the moment please ignore the redline which depicts the JGB yield; I will come back to that shortly. But theother three colored lines in that bottom panel show various spreads as theyhave traded from July to the present.My point in bringing these three panels together is to show that therewere really two very distinct episodes of delevering, which occurredroughly in the weeks following the Committee's August and Septembermeetings. There has been a third more modest delevering event in the lastfew weeks associated with the year-end. The very pronounced decline inboth the mark and the dollar against the yen seen in the top panel coincidedwith the significant turmoil in early October. You can see in the bottompanel that the three triangles point to the peak spreads reached also early inOctober. In the middle panel you can see where equity markets, at least inGermany and Japan, reached their nadirs during that period, and the Dowalmost reached its nadir and began coming back.More recently, there has been some gradual decline in the dollar againstthe yen, but it has been relatively muted, more or less associated withyear-end thinness, with some reversal of that move in the last day or so.Also in the bottom panel you can see that swap spreads and theon-the-run/off-the-run spread have backed up a little. I would emphasizethe thinness of markets rather than anything else here. But in the middlepanel you can see the somewhat manic behavior of our equity markets. It12/22/98seems to me rather pronounced and in contrast to the events in the othermarkets.Focusing now on the red line in the bottom panel, which depicts thebenchmark Japanese government bond yield, in the last few days--and sinceyour last meeting in fact--there has been an extraordinary backup in thisyield. The bond was trading at a yield of around 80 basis points at the timeof your last meeting or just before. It traded at 150 basis points yesterday.It was off a further 40 basis points earlier today, or up to 190. It has comeback a little from that level, having traded the limit down today both in theTokyo and London futures markets, and it is now at about 180 basis points.The Japanese government first began leaking and then yesterdayannounced its borrowing plans for the coming year, which in their forecastwill amount to roughly a 65 percent increase in the amount of Japanesegovernment bonds to be absorbed by the public portfolio--that is, by privatesector demand. The bond market has begun to price this in.Back in September Japanese banks were given a choice by the Ministryof Finance either to treat their bonds on a mark-to-market or on an originalcost basis. Most of the banks, virtually all, elected to do it on an originalcost basis. In my view, that simply is going to delay the day of reckoningas yields back up, given that the holdings of JGBs on the balance sheets ofall kinds of financial intermediaries are rather significant as a creditsubstitute. As the yields back up and approach the average cost of any oneinstitution's JGBs, that institution will have an extraordinary incentive tosell out its positions. That already seems to be under way and is providingsomething of a continuing accelerator for the backup in Japanesegovernment bonds. Given the extraordinary scope of this backup in just acouple of days, I think it is reasonable that the U.S. and European bondmarkets have been backing up a little, as Japanese accounts experiencingthese losses are off-loading some of their holdings of U.S. and other fixed-income instruments.Now, all this is in anticipation of the rather exciting year Japanesegovernment bond markets are going to have in 1999, so we have that tolook forward to. We in all likelihood have the specter, in my humbleopinion, of the Ministry of Finance trying to change the accounting rulesagain at the end of the fiscal year if these losses become too extreme oninsurance company and bank balance sheets.Turning to domestic operations on the next page, the funds market hasbeen a little less stable than normal, but there has been some improvementover the last intermeeting period in terms of some reduction in the extremevolatility. This chart is similar to the one I presented at your last meeting.On the vertical axis are the basis points contained within one standard12/22/98deviation of the daily trading range, and on the horizontal axis is the basispoint variation of the daily effective rate from the target. The hollow dotsrepresent observations in the intermeeting period between your Septemberand November meetings. The filled in dots represent days since your lastmeeting. And as I did last time, I have summarized in the lower left-handbox the results, roughly speaking, against the benchmark period of the prioryear before August.As you can see, while we had fewer days with very low volatility,where trading was in a tight range around the expected rate, we had roughlythe same number of days within the 50 percent box. Without counting thedots, let me point out a different way of looking at this. In the September-to-November period, fully 1/3 of the days observed had a standard deviationof greater than .4, whereas in the more recent period only 1/6 of the dayshad a standard deviation of more than .4. So we haven't come to the pointof a quiet market, but we have reduced some of the extreme volatility. Ithink this has been caused by a reduction in credit concerns and somegreater access to term funding markets, which have opened up to a widernumber of participants. Also, early in this intermeeting period we leanedrather heavily against firmness, being quite generous in our reserve-supplying operations, and when we began to take that away from themarket, it actually took the market a while to figure that out. Theyassumed, perhaps, that we were being more generous than we in fact were.On the last page I have shown the comparable data for the same periodexactly one year ago. I would note that the red dots represent the days withhigh payment flows--tax payment dates, bond settlement dates, ormaintenance period settlement dates. They are really the days when onewould expect to see the higher volatility, and that is what we see here. Inthe 1997 period the dots on normal days are much more densely clusteredthan in the comparable period this year, where we see a mix of blue and reddots at the higher volatilities, indicating the higher volatility we still arefacing. But I think that has calmed down somewhat.Let me note that we did conduct a pass to purchase indexed securitiesand we also undertook three longer-term repo operations. These elicitedrelatively little market reaction and went much as I had hoped. We alreadyhave $12 billion in repos on the books for the turn of the year, which willhelp us unwind automatically as reserve needs diminish after the peakyear-end period.Mr. Chairman, we had no foreign exchange intervention operationsduring the period. We have completed the renewal of our swaparrangements with our Mexican and Canadian colleagues, but all our otherswap arrangements have lapsed. I will need two votes, however. I havecirculated to the Committee a request to add the euro to the currencies in"

Our incum bent is Peter Fishe r. I assum e that his nomination is a cceptab le to the New York board? VICE CHAIRMAN MC DONOUGH . It is indeed. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. If the re are no objections except m ine, [laughter] I will assum e that the Committee is a gain auth orizing our inc umbent, Peter Fishe r. We have an exam ination report on the Sy stem  Open Market Account. Are there any question s on that rep ort? If not, I  will assum e that it is acceptable with out objec tion. Next we have a review of the System’s  security lending program  and a related proposal to am end the Comm ittee’s Author izatio n for Dom estic Open Market Operations. Peter, would you like to re view briefly what this involves? MR. FISHER. Yes, let m e mention a f ew points, if  I may. The Comm ittee reviews th e Authoriza tion for Dom estic Open  Market Operations at th e first m eeting each year. I have propos ed an am endm ent to the Authorizatio n for the Committee to consider. You have a rather lengthy m emo from m e on the subject. There are a few points I would like to try to cover again. I think I could have done a better job in the memo in providing a clearer contrast betw een the existing program  and the proposed program . Let m e try to do that very briefly. Under the current program  we lend secu rities for one week. We do it in accordan ce with the rath er low lim its on bills  and coupon securities as described in th e memo. We charge a flat f ee of 150 basis points, regardless of the security’s current value in the m arket, and there is a p rohibiti on on short selling. That is, w e are not supposed to lend to dealers who have sold the security short, even though that is virtually impossible for us--and in som e cases for the dealer--to de termine with accuracy. A major change we are proposing is that in stead of charging a flat fee, we would hold an auction with a m inimum reserve fee of 100 basis points. In effect, for the dealers who want the security, this provi des an allocation m echanism  that involves something other than a first-com e first-serve d, helter-skelter basis of who calls the Desk first. An au ction is also a m echanism that allows us not to w aste public assets, so to speak. That is, when we charge a flat fee of 150 basis points for som ething that is worth2/2-3/99 4 more than 150 basis points “on special” in the T reasury financing m arket, we are giving away System property, if you will, by accepti ng less in come than the Sy stem  could receive. The second change that we are proposing is  in the lim it structur e. Instead of the rather low lim its, higher lim its are proposed, as explained in the m emo. The m ost important shift is from  the one-week term of the lending to overn ight lending. I don’t think I underscored quite enough in the m emo what an im porta nt shift that would be. I have previously described to the Co mmittee m y concern that any change in this program should not simply m ove both the dem and and su pply curves out equall y. That would not accom plish very m uch. The longer we thought a bout th is, the m ore we realized that the willingn ess of  dealers an d market par ticipants to short secu rities is r eally b ased on te rm financing. No one shorts a s ecurity and plans to finance it through a series of overnight borrowings. They think in term s of one-w eek or longer tim e periods when they are trying to finance their short sales. That is where the dem and and supply for shortening securities co me from. By lim iting th e Syst em’s lending to an overnight program  whe re transactions occur only at noon, which is rather late in th e day, I think we would do a better job of  providing a lending facility th at add resses clearin g issues and keeps the market m oving, without encouraging dealers to short securities. We are trying to stand apart f rom short se lling activ ities. On the 25 percent lim it that I suggested we begin with, we would actually be lending less than we are lending currently, as  a rough-cut calculation. I noted that I would clearly expect to ra ise that limit som ewhat as I saw increased dem and, but I certainly wo uld not do s o without talking to th is Comm ittee. As I also in dicated in th e memo, it is hard to im agine ra ising that lim it at any one auction to  anything higher than 50 percent of our total holdings in an issue. We think of the proposed program  change s as enhancem ents that will better enable us to achieve ou r existing objectives. These change s are designed to provide a little g rease for the clearing m echanis m and to enable th e dealers to avo id som e of the games that go on when a security is so scarce  that borrowing it has essentially the sam e cost as failing to cover. Then people m ay not  try to cover sho rts at all and  that c reates some perversions."
19,19990330,"3/30/99 2 rates probably reflects a Y2K prem ium and should be interpreted that way and not as the anticipation of a significant upward m ovem ent in Japanese rates. Turning to the second page, let m e go over som e yield and spread relationships. In the top panel you can see yields on selected 10-year governm ent bonds for the United States, the United Kingdom , Italy, and Germ any and for the 10-year U.S. inflation-indexed security. A very simple point to note in this panel is that during the period from  October through Decem ber som e rather dram atic changes in the relationships among m ajor G-5 governm ent bond yields em erged, and those changes occurred abruptly. But from  January forward--dating roughly from  the tim e of the real float on January 15th--you can see that these bond yields began to march in parallel, giving the m arket a rather strong sense that U.K. and continental governm ent bond m arkets are following the lead of the U.S. Treasury m arket. The m iddle panel shows a series of spread relationships over the on-the-run Treasuries. In the top orange line, you can see that there was a narrowing in the m ortgage-backed spread as long-term  rates backed up in this country, reflecting a reduction in the prepaym ent risk for the m ortgage-backed portfolios. It is interesting that the other spread relationships have remained rather constant, notwithstanding the backup in the U.S. Treasury yield curve and the rather heavy issuance of  securities in the f ixed-incom e market. I think this at least suggests a growing com fort level in fixed-incom e markets with the current spread relationships. On the other hand, the bottom  red line, the twice of f-the-run U.S. Treasuries, shows that while this spread has narrowed a little to around 15 basis points, or roughly half its October peak of  30 basis points, it is still 3 tim es its pre-Russian-crisis norm  of around 5 basis points. So, while there has been som e unwinding of anxiety in that area, there still is a rather pronounced desire for liquidity in fixed-incom e markets; m arket participants seem  anxious to hold instrum ents that they can sell quickly if they want to. In the bottom  panel, you can see that both Mexican and Argentine Brady spreads have returned to, or just past, their pre-Russian-crisis levels. And the Brazilian bond is now trading at a spread against Treasuries that prevailed in Decem ber of last year, before the intensification of the problem s in Brazil. Turning to dom estic open m arket operations, page 3 has a scatter plot similar to one I have shown you before in which each dot represents a day. The horizontal axis shows the divergence of each day’s effective funds rate from the target rate. And the vertical axis depicts a m easure of  volatility3/30/99 3 expressed by the num ber of basis points contained within one standard deviation of trading around the effective rate. The blue dots on the chart cover the period from  Septem ber 30th of last year through February 3rd and the red dots cover the days since your last m eeting. Eyeing the chart, you can see that the red dots are giving us a rather better cluster around the target rate, showing a tendency toward lower volatility than we experienced in the rather dif ficult period f rom the end of Septem ber through your February m eeting. In the lower left corner is a panel with a m ore precise m easure of this to give you a sense of how the funds m arket is calm ing down. That panel shows the m edian value of the daily divergence of the effective rate from  the target rate regardless of sign and the m edian value of the daily standard deviation. Looking at the first line, in 1997 there were as m any days on which the effective rate diverged from  the target by less than 7 basis points as there where days on which it diverged from  the target by m ore than 7 basis points. Similarly, on roughly half the days the standard deviation was less than 9 basis points and on roughly half the days it was m ore than 9 basis points. As you can see, those values were m ore or less m aintained through m uch of 1998 until the end of Septem ber. After that we experienced a rather significant period of volatility, when roughly half the days had an absolute deviation from  the target of  more than 15 basis points and a volatility standard deviation of more than 24 basis points. But, as seen in the red line covering the period since the last FOMC m eeting, the values have returned to m ore norm al levels. Looking back, I think it is quite clear that in the fourth quarter of last year we faced a very anxious funds m arket, with elevated and erratic demand for excess reserves leading to volatility and f irm rates. To be candid, in January we on the Desk probably were slower to reduce our anxiety than the m arket; we were just a little behind the m arket in unwinding those anxieties and we were probably tending to be a bit generous in the provision of reserves. But that effect was overwhelm ed by the generosity that the weather-induced float provided, giving us som e rather volatile and squishy-sof t days in January. But we seem  to have come through that, and in the last interm eeting period the funds m arket appears to have returned to m uch m ore m uted and norm al conditions. Let m e conclude by noting that starting this com ing Monday we will be m oving our routine operating tim e to around 9:30 a.m ., one hour earlier than has been our practice. I want to thank the staffs of the Board and the Reserve Banks as well as the Treasury for their efforts to provide data on reserves to us m ore quickly so we can do this and participate in the m arket when it is a little m ore deep and liquid than later in the day.3/30/99 4 We had no foreign exchange intervention operations to report. We concluded the foreign currency rebalancing that the Com mittee authorized, which we will report on in f ull in the written quarterly report we will be sending you during the m onth of April. I will need the Com mittee’s ratification of our dom estic operations. I will be happy to answer any questions. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Questions for Peter? MR. POOLE. I have a quick question regarding the on-the-run and off-the-run Treasuries. Could you rem ind m e what the norm al relationship has been over the last 20 years or so? MR. FISHER. I have data going back about 15 years, and the difference has been around 5 or 6 basis points. MR. POOLE. I just wanted to be sure that the less than 7 basis points you were talking about is not the anom aly against the norm . MR. FISHER. No, it is not. MR. POOLE. The Septem ber 30 through January relationship is the anom aly. MR. FISHER. Yes, the 5, 6, 7 basis point difference was the long-term  trend for m any, m any years. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Peter, what has been happening to the bid/asked spreads of both on-the-run and off-the-run forward Treasuries? MR. FISHER. I don’t have that on the tip of m y tongue. MR. KOHN. Peter, your staff provided m e som e inform ation on that; let m e see if I can rem ember it. The on-the-run bid/asked spreads are back to norm al levels. [Laughter] CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. If you are trying to em barrass Peter, you are succeeding! MR. FISHER. No em barrassm ent as long as m y staff gets the credit! MR. KOHN.

20,19990518,"5/18/99 2 halfway through the year, the U.S. ec onom y seems to be chugging right along, while the rest of the wo rld is at best sluggish. Turning to the second page, the t op panel shows selected 3-month deposit rates in term s of t he change in basis points from  January 4 and the bottom  panel shows the percentage change in various currencies against the dollar, indexed to January 4. Without going through all the details--the specifics are covered in our written report--twelve central banks have cut rates since your last m eeting, six of th em more than once. As you can see, much of the world has declining 3- month rates and d eclin ing curren cies relative to th e dolla r. But as can b e seen clearly in the bottom panel, two interesting exception s are Mexico an d Canada, whose currencies have been strengthening against the dollar. However, it m ay be worth considering the possibility that the w eakening of our exchange rate with our North Am erican counterparts could reflect the strength of the U.S. econom y and its spillover to the north and to the south. The charts on the third page disp lay changes in the Treasury yield curve over the las t two y ears. The top panel shows rates for on-the-run coupon securities from  May 1, 1997 through May 14, 1999 and the bottom panel depicts selected yield curves. Again, as a consequence of the CPI release last Friday, you can see that the long end of the on-the-run curve has backed up to about where it was a y ear ago. That backup is a little hard to see in the top panel becau se of the brownish-orange v ertical lin e, but the bottom panel shows it m ore clearly; the yield on the 30-year bond rose to 5.91 percent and the 10-year ra te went to 5.61 percent. But it is worth pointing out in the m icro picture of the last few days that the 30-year bond had backed up--you cannot see it in this scale--to 5.86 percent on Wednesday in anticipation of  the PPI num bers to be released on Thursday. Those data gave the m arket som ething of a pleasant surprise and the bond closed Thursday at 5.75 percent. So the m arket had been bracing itself for a negative inflation s hock, got a head fake from  the PPI numbers Thursday, and then got fake d out again Friday. This m orning, the long bond is actually trading at 5.87 percent, only 1 basis point higher than the close on W ednesday. It cert ainly was a big m ove, but it is worth noting that som e of it had already occurred, was taken away, and then given back. Of the four yield curves shown in  the bottom  panel, the steep est was on May 1, 1997, which is before any of the pressures developed in Thailand. The panel also depicts the rather flat yield curve of May 1998, the inverted curve of last October, and last Friday’s yield curve. The floating diamonds reflect the twice o ff-the-run 30-year bond yield, which I have noted there as a placeholder. I think of that rate as providing something of a crude m easure of m arket uncertainty about the level of long-term  rates. Which way to look at  the liquidity prem ium is som ething5/18/99 3 worth pondering. To anticipate what the Chairm an m ay ask me after m y remarks: Yes, bid/ask spreads on both on-the-run and off-the-run securities are a good bit wider today than they were at the time of your last meeting. They had com e in a little further by the end of April, but the noise of the last few days has m oved them  out a bit. Turning to open m arket operations, the top chart on page 4 shows the trading range of the funds rate over the last four m aintenance periods. As shown in the upper left portion, coveri ng the first m aintenance period from March 25 to April 7, we supplied a high level of excess reserves to try to get th rough the quarter-end and m onth-end period , but we faced fairly typical pressures for such a period. However, the intriguing interval was the second period, depicted in the uppe r right portion of the chart, when we never quite appreciated the speed w ith which banks shifted to a desire to be on the short side of m eeting th eir reserve requirem ents. You can see there how softly the funds  rate traded over the period, when we supplied only $900 million of excess reserves on average. Initially, lower-than-expected tax receipts through most of April were a contributing factor, as receipts lagged our daily estim ates. They caught up at the end of the month, leaving the m arket in itially in the next period with higher reserve levels than we intended. There also seem s to have been some hangover effect from  last year when we had a very soft funds rate. To bring pricing back in line, we le ft excess reserves in rather short supply at the start of the Apr il 22 m aintenance period, which was compounde d by a bit of a m iss and gave us a rather firm  market on April 26 with a standard deviation of 197 basi s points. That did seem to shock the m arket back to a trad ing level a li ttle clos er to the target. But, again, we have seen som e oscillation. Yesterday’s fund s market was a bit firm er than we had hoped, but rath er typical for a quarter ly refunding day; the effective rate was around 5.01 percent. The average rate for the period w e are in now is still just 4.76 percent, including yesterday’s firm rate. Turning to the next page, I’ve pr ovided a quick summ ary so you can see that this year’s tax season was roughly sim ilar to last year’s tax season. The blue dots represent 1998 and the red dots 1999. Funds have traded around zero for the effective rate m inus the target rate, as is evident by the cluster of dots near zero on the ver tical axis showing the standard deviation. If you look rather carefully --perhaps if you squint--you can see that the softness of last year was not entirely repeated. The shorthand way to see that is  to note that there are s lightly m ore red dots than blue dots to the right of the zero, i.e. on the firm er side. But the pattern w as roughly similar to last year’s. Let m e mention a few other issues regarding our open m arket operations. We comm enced the securi ties lending program  on April 26.5/18/99 4 Since then we have lent securities on 16 different days, and on 5 occasio ns we had overbidding in the 30-year bond, beyond our lending lim it of 25 percent of our holdings. There were also 3 occasions when we had m ore bids than we needed in the 10-year  area. There were 4 days of no borrowing. Interestingly, on 8 days we  lent bills and coupons that were not being actively traded. I view that  as a very good sign for the program --that it really involved securities loan s that were very close to m aturity and m ight have led to fails; so, that was very helpful. Let me be clear that I think this program  is going well. As I mentioned last tim e, I am  likely to want to raise the lim its at som e point  in the future, but before doing so I will com plete a m ore thorough analy sis of our ex perien ce with the program , which I will share with the Comm ittee and the Treasury. In our outright operations since your last m eeting, we added a net of $11.74 billion to the SOMA portfolio in  16 different pass operations over 12 different days. We did a TIPS pass where we purchased $ 303 m illion of inflation-indexed securities agains t bids by the dealers of $3.9 billion. The reaction  to our purchases in the TIPS m arket was very muted. I would note that currency in circulation has been growing m ore rapidly this year than last year, which explains in part the extent of our outright operations through April. The currency com ponent of M1 has grown at an average annual m onthly rate of 10.9 percent versus 6.7 percent last year. For the com ing interm eeting period, we are now forecasting a $9.9 billio n growth in curren cy as opposed to $ 5.3 billion over the same period last year. A num ber of you have asked m e abou t our prelim inary thinking at the Desk on Y2K issues. I thought it would be helpf ul to share with you som e thoughts on this, but I want to be clear that these are very prelim inary views. I am not comm itted to the se ideas, but it m ight be helpf ul to take you through them , even though I am  not looking for approval or concurrence at this tim e. If you turn to the next page, I have listed som e of our prelim inary thoughts on this subject. First and m ost im portantly, I think there is an increased lik elihood that later in th e year th e Desk  will be operating on both sides of  the m arket, alternately adding and draining reserves in any given period  of tim e. Secondly, th e Special Len ding Facility  that the Board addre ssed yesterd ay, if used a s intend ed, will prov ide a m eans f or the System ’s balance sh eet to expan d as we lend to sm all banks, who m ay be perceived to be less well prepared  than the large banks to handle any Y2K problem s. Small banks m ay lose  deposits either through outright withdrawals or transfers of deposits to  larger banks that are perceived to be better prepared."
21,19990630,"6/29-30/99 2 April, and w eak Italian production in April. So, while som e signs of a bottom ing in the European econom y have em erged, I don’t think that trans lates directly in to concrete expectations of an ECB rate hike. Rather, evidence of a slight pickup in activity coupled with strong expectations f or U.S. rate increases, again st the b ackdr op of a weak euro, have com pletely eliminated any expectations of further rate cuts by the ECB and in that sense have increased the risks of a rate hike. But this has left euro-a rea interest rate m arkets without any direction, leaving them highly susceptible to being dragged around by the m ovement in U.S. rates. Unfortunately, I did not include in these charts a panel on the Germ an yield cu rve. But in the p eriod since your last m eeting the 10-year Germ an bund a nd, m ost surp risingly, the 2-year Germ an bund have m arched along with our yield curve alm ost in lock step as they too have backed up over the last 60 days. It may turn out that the euro-area econom y has turned and  will pick up  steam  from  this poin t forward, but most of the backup in euro-area interest  rates appears to m e to be a case of their following our lead. In the bo ttom panel of  this char t, which depicts Japanese forward rates, you can see that the 9-m onth forward 3-month rate backed up following the report of a much strong er-th an-exp ected GDP num ber for the first quarter. Then, it seem s to me, the data go berserk in this panel. Even though we have checked and doubl ed checked them , this is the best we have been able to com e up wit h. But you should also recognize that this sc ale is twice th at of the othe r panels on th is chart in  order to provide any view at all of Japanese interest ra tes. There is  a level of noise in the Japanese m arkets that I d on’t even p retend to und erstand. But I will ho ld with m y ass essment that I don’t thin k anyone really expects the Bank of Japan to raise rates any tim e soon. There is m uch seesawing in views about what to expect in the Tankan survey. Every few days authorities step forward to say they still think the econom y is weak, and this has been going on for som e time. Turning to the next chart, the st eady weakening o f the euro ag ainst the dollar since its launch in January has been widely attributed to the surprising strength of the U.S. econom y. Obviously, the relative strength of the U.S. econom y ver sus the Europ ean econom ies has played a role in the m ovements of the dollar against th e euro but it does not explain the weakness of the euro ag ainst the yen . It strikes m e that if one wants to make the case that Europe’s growth di fferentia l with the United Sta tes ha s been the principal cause of the euro’s  weakness, one needs to look at the relationships am ong all three currencies.  If one does that, I think it is evident that the yen has been play ing a dom inant role, both in the last six months and over the last two years.6/29-30/99 3 In the third page of charts, the top panel presents a view of G-3 exchange rates from  the dollar’s pers pective, depicting the value since January of 1997 of one dollar in terms of  the euro in red and the value of one dollar in term s of the yen di vided by one hundred in green. The bottom  panel provides a view of exchange rates from  the yen’s perspective, depicting the value of one hundred yen in dollars, the green line, and the value of 100 yen in euros, the blue line. With the naked eye I think you can see that the yen-based pair in the bottom  panel track each other m uch mo re closely than the d ollar-bas ed pair in the top panel. Comparing th e correlation coefficients n oted in the subperiods in the top and bottom  pane ls, you can see that the only period in which the daily changes of the dol lar pair track ed m ore closely was from  January through April of 1997. From  May 1997 onward, when the unwinding of the yen carry trades began to put pressure on the Thai baht, the daily changes in the yen pair ha ve correlated much m ore closely. Now, neither of these graphs nor th e correlations is proof that the yen is the p rincipal dr iver of  the G-3 exc hange rates. But I do think the data powerfully suggest that the differenc es between North Am erica on the one hand and Europe on the other are much less s ignificant than the differences, as expres sed in excha nge rates, between Japan on the one hand and North Am erica and Europe on the other. If euro/yen and dollar/yen are m oving to the beat of one drum, there is only so m uch room  left for inde pendent expression in the euro/dollar exchange rate. Again, I certainly be lieve that differences in growth prospects between the U nited States  and the euro-11 influence the euro/do llar exchange ra te. But I al so think th at the weak Japanese econom y and the crippled Japanese f inancial system  have had an oscillating influence on portfolio allo cations that in turn have had a significan t impact on th e major exchange  rates--an im pact that has been ignored by those who do not take the tim e to consider all th ree sides of the triangle. Turning to the fourth page of char ts, the top panel depicts euro/yen and dollar/yen exchange rates as they have traded since the start of the year. The bottom  panel shows the implied volatilities of one-m onth options on all three of the major currency pairs since the start of the year. Now, the third perc eptio n I m entioned at the outset was that the Japanese authorities can be relied upon to stabilize the yen w ith verbal and official intervention. The germ  of tr uth in that perception is that the Japanese authorities have stabilized th e yen so f ar this y ear, a t least to some appearances. The problem  is that the m arket’s app arent reliance on the authorities’ ability to do so is li kely to be m isplaced. On January 12,6/29-30/99 4 indicated by the vertical  line on the lef t in the top  panel, th e Japanese authorities purchased And the shaded area on the right indicates the of dolla r intervention and the of euro intervention the Japanese aut horities conducted in m id-June. While there was a m odest uptick in the implied volatili ties, as shown in the bo ttom panel, what surp rises me is how little and how short- lived that reaction was. Indeed, dollar/yen and euro/y en implied volatilities ar e back to th eir lows of the year. Anecd otal ev idence from  the m arket suggests strongly that many who have exposures are sim ply leaving them unhedged and that others are eager to write options and collect prem iums, leaving them selves unhedged, all in th e expectation that the Japanese author ities will keep th e yen conta ined. It is po ssible tha t the yen will stabiliz e; I d on’t want to rule that ou t entirely. But I th ink it is  more like ly that the re liance on tha t expecta tion will sim ply delay th e position adjustm ents--or worse, w ill encourag e an entirely  new round of yen carry trades. The fifth page of charts addresse s the last perception I m entioned-­that the levels of interest rates and of econom ic activity in the United States will b e dete rmined princ ipally by the words and deeds of the members of this Comm ittee. I should, of course, point out th at the re is an elem ent of truth behind that perception also, par ticula rly with  respec t to the pred ictable im pact of the Comm ittee’s deeds on short-term rates. Within the last few weeks, in the absence of what we m ight norm ally think of as noteworthy data, it seem s to m e that bond yields have been pushed higher by a m edley of unattributed voices. The top panel depicts several stages of the bond m arket’s move ments since your last m eeting. First, I think  it is wor th noting th at in the days f ollowing the Comm ittee’s announcem ent on May 18 the bond m arket rallied. The long bond rallied every day that week; along the rest of  the yield curve other bonds backed up on the day after the announcem ent but ra llied for the rest of the week. Now, in defense of the m arket, I don’t think its initial reaction was unreasonable. After all, the 10-year  Treasury had already backed up 50 basis points in yield from early Apri l. I think the m arket took som e pleasure in s eeing th at the central ban k was preparing to react to the perceived risk of inflation but did not plan to do so abruptly or in a knee-jerk f ashion.  I think it is also wort h noting that many m arket participants interpreted the FOMC’s announcem ent as implying a heightened risk of a 25 basis point increase in rates. However, beginning on May 27, the m arket began receiving a series of reports about the views of the Committee, including com ments by FOMC m embers and other Fed officials suggesting that a m ore aggressive tightening should be expected. This threat, giving the m arket a new sense"
22,19990824,"8/24/99 2 MR. KELLEY. Second. CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. I assum e no discu ssion is required, at least I trus t not. If so, the presum ption is that Da vid Howard is elected unanimously. I’d also like to recognize First Vice Pres ident Jam ie Stewart who is attending his first meeting. We welcom e you. Peter Fisher, would you review developm ents in foreign currency and dom estic financial m arkets and dom estic open m arket operations? MR. FISHER. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. In front of the m embers of the Comm ittee is a pack age of charts, sim ilar to the one I usually show.1/ I will beg in by address ing agenda item 3, m y report on m arkets and the Desk’s activ ities. The first page, covering the period from  June 1 through August 20, presents a slightly different configur ation of charts than I usually show you. The top panel depicts U.S. depos it rates, current and forward; the middle panel shows yields on U.S. Treasury secu rities ; and th e bottom panel shows the percent change in various equity m arket indices. In the top panel, you can see that  from the tim e of the Comm ittee’s last m eeting on June 30 until the Chairm an’s Humphrey-Hawkins testim ony on July 22, current and fo rward 3-m onth deposit rates m oved more or less sideways. They began rising f airly consistently af ter the Chairm an’s testim ony through the tim e of the release of ECI and GDP data and the nonfar m payroll em ployment num bers, and then cam e off noticeably following the publication of the PPI on August 13 and, two days later, the CPI. Even m ore interesting than that m ovement in rates is the changed structure of the forward rates from  the beginning of June to the beginning of August. On June 1, shown at the far left-hand side of the chart, the 6-m onth forward 3-mont h rate and the 9-m onth forward 3-month rate were trading rather closely together at around 5.8 percent and the 3-m onth forward rate was around 5.4 percent. Now, I would suggest that the proxim ity of th e 6-month forward and the 9-month forward rates had to do with the m arket’s exp ectations that the Comm ittee was likely to tighten a bit in the future. They didn’t quite know when, and they didn’t know what  would happen after that. There might be just one m ove. So, som e of the term  prem ium between those two m aturities was squeezed out. By August 1, you see that the 6-m onth forward rate had shifted and was then tr ading in line with the 3 -month forward rate. Several things happened in the m onth of July, I think.  Obviously, the m arket’s attention 1 / A copy of the m aterial used by Mr. Fisher  is appended to the transcript.8/24/99 3 was focused on the Chairm an’s Humphrey-Hawkins testim ony, particula rly his comm ent tha t the Committee would act promptly and forcefully. There was increas ing attention during the m onth on the funding pressures antic ipated in the fourth quarter  and in early January as a result of the century date change. Also, there was the rolling forward of the m aturity of these contract s, which changed each day. To m ake the point very specifi cally, on August 1 the 3-m onth forward 3-month rate involved a deposit whose term covers precisely the period when the greates t pressu res are e xpected--November, December, and January. If you look at the early A ugust period on the chart, you see that the 3-m onth forward rate actually traded  below, even if just a few basis points, the 6-m onth forward rate. Now, I’m  not s ure the m arket’s expectations  are co rrect. But the fo rward rates are showing us that the market is pricing up considerably the deposit rates for this 3-m onth window, erasing whatever term  prem ium one might expect to exist between the 3-m onth for ward and th e 6-m onth forward because of the anticipated pressures around the year-end. Turning to the m iddle panel on Treasury yields, you can see that those yields more or less followed th e sam e pattern relative to the data releases. However, just before the release of the nonfar m payroll data on August 6, there was a two-day rally across the yield curve after the Treasury’s refunding announcem ent in which Treasury officials discussed the introduction of buy b acks and the elim ination of the 30-year auction in Novem ber. That rally was short lived, unwinding after the release of the nonfarm payroll da ta. I’d note that the 30-year bond from  Friday, August 20 through today traded  at a rate identical to the rate at which it closed on June 30, the da y of your last m eeting, whereas both the 10-year and the 2-year rates are roughly 10 basis points higher. In the bottom panel you can see that  equity m arkets here in the United States m ore or less tracked inversely the m ovements in yields. If we include yesterday’s change in the D OW on that panel, th e increas e in th e DOW woul d be 6.6 percent. Turning to the second page and to  European m arkets, the top panel shows the forward rates and current rates for 3-m onth deposits on euros. As is eviden t in th e middle of  the top panel, the 9-month forward 3-month euro deposit rate jum ped appreciably following the European Central Bank’s press conference on July 15, during which President Duisenberg suggested that there was bias creeping into the ECB’s delibe ration s. Several d ays later, on the releas e of German IFO survey data on business confidence, whic h was som ewhat stronger than expected, th ere was a very abrupt ju mp in the 3-month forward deposit rate; but that was com pletely unwoun d subsequently. What I think is8/24/99 4 notice able b oth in th e top panel and in the m iddle panel depicting European bond yields is the extent  to which these rates m oved in response to U.S. data releases and m oved m ore or less in a pattern sim ilar to tha t in U. S. markets. The bottom  panel shows the euro- dollar exchange rate. One can see that the euro has m oved up a bit off its lows aga inst the do llar, particularly in the week of July 19 to July 23. There are two stories circulating in foreign exchange m arkets about movem ents in exchange rates. One is that a revival of gl obal growth, especially in Europe and Japan, will be narrowing growth differe ntials with  the United States. The second is that the Fed is about to tighten and that that will be bad for U.S. assets and bad for leverage and, theref ore, for the dollar. Now, both of these stories could be true. I don’t m ean to discount that possibility. But I would note that m any observers, particularly in the foreign exchange markets, have tended to focus in their conversations on the first story--the narrowing of global growth differentials . But it seem s to m e that the asset m arket m ovements reflect m ore of  the latter story--that is, the fear that a Fed tightening will be bad for assets and bad for leverage. In the bottom panel, one can see that in the week beginning July 19, following Duisenberg’s comments about  creeping bias, the dollar cam e off quite abruptly. That Monday m orning several large asset m anagers thought it was an opportune tim e to buy euros. They did not expect the kind of exchange m arket reaction that  occurred. They found a very, very thin m arket and the dollar m oving downw ard quite briskly. It appears to me and to others, in hindsight, that th e market was very th in partly in anticipation of the Chairm an’s Hu mphrey-Hawkins testim ony. That dollar trend accelerated som e on the re lease of th e Germ an IFO survey data even though, as you can see in th e other panels on the page, the IFO survey had very little im pact on fo rward rates or on the yield curve. I would underscore that the dollar is still quite strong against the euro. If my chart depicted it through this morning, it would be trading at 1.05. Transla ting this m orning’s ra te into a rate m ore familiar to us all, the dollar-m ark, that rate would be 1.86. So, I just w ant to em phasize that, regardless of its m ovements against th e euro, the dollar in historic term s is quite strong. Turning to the third page, whic h depicts Japanese m arkets, you can see on the left side of the top panel th at Japanese forward rates rose a bit following the release on July 29 of stronger-than-expected Japanese industrial production data for June. Japan’s IP w as plus 3 percent on a month-over-month basis as opposed to minus 1 percent in May. But it is hard not to notice that, again, Japanese  forward r ates m ore or  less in the ir"
23,19991005,"10/5/99 2 Turning to the second page, the top pane l shows exchange rates since the start of the year: yen per Euro in green; yen pe r dollar in red on the left-hand scale; and dollars per E uro in blue on the right-hand s cale. Interestingly, the two scales happen to match in percen tage term s with a slightly  different location of the decim al. When I look at this chart, what I see is the he rding behavior of Japanese institutional investors rushing back into the yen in th e third qu arter. You c an see th e shift beginning at the tim e of our m eeting on J une 30th. Now, it may be that econom ic funda mentals change abruptly with calendar quarters, but to  my way of t hinking it is much more likely that it is investor beha vior that changes abruptly with calendar quarters. I don’t know what to expect w ith this change of calendar quarters, but when I look at the third-quarter  picture I see a rush of Japanese investors back into the yen. The bottom  panel dep icts 1-m onth option implied volatilities  on each of these exchange rate pairs. If there are anxi eties being expressed in foreign exchange markets, those anxieties to m e seem focuse d on the yen and not the dollar, at least so far this year. As you can see, the green and red yen-based volatilities tracked one another and spiked as we cam e to the e nd of the third quarter . The euro/do llar implied volatilities traded at a rather calm  pace. Turning to page 3 and dom estic open m arket operations, during the three maintenance periods since your last m eeting, with the exception of last Thursday and Friday, the fed funds  market behaved in  a fairly typical and calm  manner. The deviation of the effective rate from  the targ et and the in tra-day volatility, expressed in the standard deviation, we re both moderate and sim ilar to the experience of other recen t months. Last Th ursday, Septem ber 30th, was actually  a fairly typical m onth-end day. Friday, October 1st, also a day of  big f lows in the m arket, was a little les s typical. We ended up providing sufficient re serves on the day to have the effective rate trade on the target, as  you can see with the red horiz ontal tick right on the dotted line. But in doing so we clearly provided a sufficiency of reserves that was m ore than the m arket looked f or in term s of the standard deviation, and we had a very wide trading range and a whopping 60 basis poi nts standard deviation of the trading range. But that’s in effect what it takes to try to get the fed funds rate to trade on average at th e targ et on a day of volatile paym ent flows. I’d just note that currency in circulati on has continued to grow at a rather rapid clip of  about 10 percent per year. That is consistent with the rates w e have seen this year, but well ahead of past y ears. I don’t know about the Board’s staff, but we have not found any evidence sugges ting that consum er dem and for currency is Y2K-related. We do see what app ears to be som e stockpiling of currency by small banks in anticipation of consum er demand, but we don’t yet see anything we could pinpoint as indicative of  consum er de mand for notes. Turning to the next page, the fourth ch art dep icts spreads on s elected long er-term instru ments to comparable U. S. Treas uries. I included this chart to em phasize the noticeab le im pact on Septem ber 8th when we announced our special y ear-end10/5/99 3 operations and again on Septem ber 14th when  we had a m eeting with the prim ary dealers to discuss the details of our operation and get som e feedback. You can see that both of those events seem ed to ha ve had a pronounced effect, particularly on mortgage-backed spreads, the 10-year sw ap spread, and the F annie Mae benchm ark, but they obviously had hardly any effect on the corporate index. I want to be careful not to overstate the im pact. Our announ cement cam e just a few days after Labor Day when traders were com ing back and were  likely to bring more volume into the market. The backup in spreads that occurred  in the thin m arkets of late August was going to unwind at some point in Septem ber absent som e exogenous shock. We may have just provided a bit of the impet us to pull the spreads down a bit--and a little m ore quickly than they m ight have co me down otherwis e. But all in  all we were plea sed with the m arket reac tion to our announcem ent and we received quite a lot of feedback on it. In the next few pages I have outlined so me notes to try to take you through a number of issues associated with our y ear-end operations. Forgive m e for this format, but I thought it would be the most  efficient way. With respect to the expanded collateral, tri-party, and longe r-term  operations, we’ve now completed the legal documents. The basic operational proc edures are in place a nd we expect in the next few days to be able to start the tr i-party operations with  a broader array of collateral. I want to be quite blunt that I think we are going to scuff our knees a few times as we try to figure out the best way to do this. We have different classes of collateral, and a num ber of dealers have ur ged that we provide separate pricing for each of the m ajor types of collateral.  At the sam e time, there is a differen ce between tri-party settlem ent and fed-wire settlem ent, and som e other dealer s want us to price that. We cannot do all of those things at on ce. It would just be  an operational rat’s nest if we tried to do all that. So we are going to learn som ething from  doing and we will jus t try to g et a feel for how we can slice  the oper ations to try to let the dealers price as efficiently as possib le. Another point is that I’d like to anno unce the p ricing details of the Desk’s temporary operations. By tradition, the Desk  has not announced the lowest repo rate at which we operate nor any deta ils of dealer prop osition s. The philosoph y has been that we’re managing quantities of reserves  and that there is no operational--and certainly no policy --signif icance to th is stop -out rate, or lowest  rate at which we operate. However, given the intense interest  in turn-of-the-year financing rates and to avoid rumors about rates paid on our ope rations, I’d like to begin announcing the details of  rates subm itted in our oper ations, both f or repos and  matched sales. It would be possible to limit th ese announcem ents just to those operations that span the yea r-end . But I think  trying to mainta in tha t distin ction would be awkward and probably unsustainable given de aler interest in p ricing other tim e horizons, not just the turn-of-the-year period. Moreover, a num ber of central banks now routinely provide this inform ation and, taking a step back and thinking about it, I concluded that we also should provide this inform ation. I would pl an to include a review of this announ cement practice in March of next year when we present th e Committee with a com plete review of  our year-end operations.10/5/99 4 At the top of  page 6 I have listed in detail what we propose to announce after each operation: the rang e of repo rates s ubmitted by deale rs; the to tal vo lume of propositions  subm itted; the stop-ou t rate, i. e. the lowest repo rate accepted ; the volum e-weighted ave rage of  repo ra tes ac cepted ; and the vo lume of proposition s that we accepted, and thus the reserv es we injected. The latter we have been announcing for som e time now. We woul d make sim ilar announcem ents on the breakdown of infor mation on m atched sales used in reserve draining operations. And, obviously, if we have different cl asses of pricing, we would m ake the announcem ents for each class of collateral th at we price. Turning to the standby financing facility in the options proposal, we received a num ber of comments from  the dealers and we sent the dealers another revision to that program last W ednesday, which I ci rculated to you in m emo for m last Wednesday. I would plan to announce the details of those au ctions also. Along with the results of the auctions, we would provide pricing infor mation to the dealers, the rang e of bids subm itted, the volu me of bids subm itted, th e lowest b id accepted-­which in the Dutch auction would be wher e all awards are p riced--and th e volum e-weighted av erage of all accepted bid s. Consisten t with our p ractice of announcing the am ount of reserves injected, we woul d also plan to announce the dollar volum e of options exercised each day during th e period of tim e when options can be exercised. We’ve received from  the dealer community and from  other market participants a fairly wide range of indi cations of the potential dem and for these options. If one listened to the m oney m arket mutual fund m anagers and som e of the big corporate players in financing market s, one would think we would be writing $100 billion or $150 billion of these options . Making a guesstim ate on the basis of listening to the CFOs of dealer firm s, the num ber of options we would write would measure roughly in the tens of billions, proba bly in the several tens of billions. If one listened just to the repo dealers, who are very picky and think these things are deeply out of the m oney and rather a nuisan ce, they suggest that we m ight need to provide an amount in the $5 billion to $20 b illion range. So we have a full range of reactions f rom the m arket. Just in the  last few days, in response to our revised proposal, we’ve gotten the sens e of the dem and going up a little even in the CFO community--the ones who really do want to take out the flood insurance. And I think we’ve structured this whole package on the prem ise that we’re going to m eet demand. We’re go ing to  sell enough for that constituency to b e comfortable. So, we m ay need to revise up the am ounts for our  initial auction that I put in the revision last week and m ake those a li ttle higher. Inevitably, we’re going to need to adjust to the dem and as it b ecom es eviden t in the firs t auction and over the series of  auction s. But I’d like to be clear, since m eeting demand is one of our objectives, that an unfilled auc tion is not go ing to be an em barrassment but one s ign of  succe ss. We’re not looking for a high bid-to-cover ratio he re but rather the opposite. We’re trying to meet the communities’ dem and. After we have launched the expanded co llateral and tri-party operations and the stand-by  financing f acility auc tions on repos, we will then  turn our a ttention and"
24,19991116,"11/16/99 2 there are bas is points--are the 2- to 10-year spreads on July 1st and on the right side are the 2- to 10-year sp reads as of last Fr iday. What I enjoy about this chart in par ticular, as it relates to what is of interest to m e, is how  little I understand about what’s going on here. Germ an and ot her Continental yields began to rally just ahead of, but through th e releas e of Euro area M3 data, which to all observers were higher than expected. But the b ond m arkets took off on a nice rally that continued w ith the release of our GDP data and then continued through the 50 basis point ECB rate increase. Now, this  has been explained different ways in Europe. Most have focused on the idea that uncertainty about near-term  ECB intentions has been removed and a rela ted perception that the ECB is now on hold. Another theory is that the ECB has gained credib ility b y being pre -emptive and is now ahead of the curve. The f irst th eory uncomfortab ly sugg ests to m e that the un certainty p remia for anticipated central bank actio ns have a larg er pos itive basis p oint im pact on long-term rates than does an actual central ba nk rate increase. For the second argum ent about credibility to hold wa ter, Europe would have to be m ore sensitive to short-term rates th an to long -term , because ot herwise th e decline in long-term  yields would underm ine the restraining influence of  short-term  rates. But throughout m y career and through current events, my colleag ues in Europe have always told m e that Europ e is m ore sensitiv e to long -term  rates than those s illy Anglo Saxon econom ies that are so focused on short-term  rates. So, I am  not quite sure how the credibility argum ent plays here either. Looking at the United Kingdom , it’s intri guing how the 10-year gilt yield has marched along with Germ an and other Con tinental yields despite the fact that these countries are at very different points  in the econom ic cycle. To draw a point on it, the 2- to 10-year spread in the UK is  inverted to the tune of 85 basis points while the Germ an spread, as you can see, is positive from  2- to 10-years in the amount of 115 basis points. Notwiths tanding the econom ies being at different points in the cycle, these yi elds are m arching along rather in lock step. Maybe the rally in gilts is what is pu lling Continental yields lower. Looking at U.S. yields, I’d just note that  with 2- to 10-year spreads having narrowed from  26 basis points on July 1st to 15 basis points last Friday--and I think to 12 basis points this m orning--one  might understand that there are few if any voices in our bond m arket who are prep ared to join the “bubble-ologists” in proclaim ing that the Fed is behind the curve. Looking down the page, the next three pane ls depict yield spreads of various instrum ents over U.S. Treasuries. In the first of these three panels you can see that the em erging m arket index spreads to U.S. Treasuries have been narrowing consistently since last summer’s highs; and they have narrowed by an additional 150 basis points since the Oct ober release of the CPI. In the next panel you can see that the spread of th e Merrill Lynch high yield index, or junk bond index, to Treasuries h as been relatively s table but  has widened recen tly, moving in just the11/16/99 3 opposite direction of the em erging market sp reads. Market talk is focused on an explicit shift of funds out of U.S. high-yield instru ments into em erging market high-yield instrum ents and also on increas ed sensitivity to r ising def ault rates in domestic high-yield m arkets. Finally, in the last panel you can see that spreads on 10-year swaps and the F annie Mae b enchm ark have com e off their recent highs of last summ er and returned m ore or less to  the levels of early July. And corporate spreads a re off their hig hs, but are st ill just a tad wider than in July. Turning to the third page and year-end funding m arkets, this chart shows the three com ponents of the cu rrent butterfly. That is , it depicts the Nove mber, Decem ber, and January LIBOR 1- month contracts. As you can see, th e declin e in the Decem ber contract from  late October to mid-Novem ber has been noticeable. That seem s to reflect at least a couple of  things com ing together. First, in an exaggerated way the Decem ber contract follows the sam e pattern as the Nove mber and January contracts, I th ink reflecting the ebb and flow of expecta tions  for rate a ction by the Comm ittee, p articula rly following th e release of the GDP and ECI data. However, it also  seem ed to get qu ite an im pact from our third round of auctions of options on Nove mber 3rd and particularly from  our announcem ent on November 4th that the Desk would hold four m ore rather than only two m ore auctions. Turning to the next page, let m e go ove r the d etails of each of the auc tions we’ve held. The vertical colum ns give you for each of the th ree strips the actual auction am ounts, the total propositions, the bid-to-cover ratio, the awards we gave out or the stop-out rates on a Dutch auc tion, and the high and low bids. Having told the dealers we would try to m eet de mand for these op tions, we f elt a n eed to respond to the high bid-to-cover ratios of the first two auctions. In all cases these were at rather elevated leve ls: 4 to 1, 4.7 to 1, 6.4 to 1, etc. So we raised the amount sharply for the third auction, doub ling the am ounts for both the turn of the year strip and for the January strip. While the bid-to-cover ratio cam e down in the third auction, the stop-out rates and thus the Dutch awards cam e in quite high. You can see that in the awards colu mn in the third entry in each  panel: 11 basis points, 16 basis points, and 11.5 basis points. So, after the third au ction we left the amount for the turn of the year strip constant at $50 billion but raised the am ounts for the surrounding strips. We also announced that we w ould hold at least four more auctions for a total of seve n, rathe r than just two m ore for a total of five. We think this helped calm  the dealers and their cus tomers considerably, as reflected both in th e Decem ber LIBOR contract and in th e much reduced stop-out rates for the fourth auction. We’ve reduced the am ounts for the fifth auction to be held to morrow for each of the three strips to $15, $30, and $20 billion and, obviously, we will see how the subsequent au ctions go.11/16/99 4 Looking forward, as I’ve m entioned previously, I would consider this operation a com plete success if none of  these options is exercised. The motivating p rinciple still seem s valid to m e that th e more we sell, the le ss likely it is tha t they will be ex ercised. But there st ill is a  risk th at the y will be ex ercis ed. If relatively sm all amounts are exercised on any one day for reasons specific to an individu al firm --its own funding position or  its o wn collectio n of collateral--we should be able to drain sufficient reserves  to m anage the im pact on the funds rate that day through our own m atched-sales operations. But if all, or even substantial amounts, are exercised on any day it is harder to anticipate the im pact on the funds rate. Any shock sufficient to cause a large-scale exercise of these options can also be expected to have a profound im pact on th e funds rate and on other short-term  market interest rates. So, it is  hard to know in adva nce with any clarity what it is we would be doing vis-à-vis that day’s funds rate. In any event, if such an exogenous shock were to happen, we woul d likely be trying to drain reserves not to m anage that day’s funds rate, but to try to moderate the im pact on cumulative excess reserves for the period--the impact over the rest of the period. But that is obviously som ething we’ll have  to decide on a case-by-case basis. Turning to the next page and our m ore traditional open m arket operations, the top pan el depicts various forecas t scenarios in volving a cu mulative res erve drain from  currency in circulation. Reserve needs have continued to grow recen tly--ref lecting, it seem s to us, typical season al growth in curren cy in circulation and the strong dem and from  banks for increased vault cash in anticipation of Y2K-relate d dem ands of the public. Shown in the bottom  dotted line of  this p anel is the N ew York sta ff’s previous “low” projection for currency in circula tion. We calle d that a b ase-case s cenario in which we im agined there would be no Y2K i mpact. The higher dash ed line is what we called a “hig h” forecast--not a worst cas e scenario b ut just a stro ng Y2K effect. The two solid lines reflect how we’ve revised up bo th of those forecas ts because the actual levels have com e in m ore or less right on track with our high, but not worst case, forecast. So, we’ve rev ised up our low forecast for currency  by alm ost $20 billion for the turn of the year, based on the experience we’ve seen through m id-Nove mber. In the bottom panel is a chart depicting the pricing of our long-term  RPs. Let me give you a little background on that before I describe the chart. We have conducted five long-term tri-party RPs th at run through the turn of the year, totaling about $27 billion. We have done more than 20 overnight and short-term tri-party RPs. In each o f these RPs we have sep arately priced U.S. Treasury securities, agency debt, and m ortgage-backed  collateral and h ave carefully tried to maintain a c onsisten t relationsh ip between  our sense of current m arket rates for each type of  collateral and our stop-out ra tes, co nsciously ch oosing not to violate the existing spreads. What is depicted in this chart is the cum ulative p roposition s we’ve receiv ed on all five of these long-term --through the ye ar-end--RPs. The vertical axis is the"
25,19991221,"12/21/99 2 have tested our work papers and agree with our  conclusion that we sim ply can’t go back any further. There are tw o possible causes of  this overstatem ent that we have to confront. One is the diversion of funds a nd the ot her is error. Now, we cannot rule out the possibility of a diversion of funds. But people from  our own audit function and from  Pricewaterhouse-Coopers hav e reviewed the contro l procedures we’ve had in p lace for the last decade and are very com fortable with the conclusion that th ese control procedures are sufficiently robust that the likelihood of diversion is  remote. It cannot be ruled out, but for diversion to have occurred it would have had to involve the co llusion of m any people--j ust an extraordinary number of people--on several diffe rent staffs. If anything, our control procedur es run a little to the “b elt and suspend ers” direc tion in rega rd to control of the flow. So, there is reasonable confidence that no dive rsion of funds occurred. The much more likely cause is a simple accounting error.  The failure to cred it the accrual account when cash was received would have left this acco unt overs tated. But we  have worke d the accoun ting back as far as we can take it and cannot find the erroneous entry or entries. Dave Sheehy, the New York Fed’s General Auditor, and I are both looking into a funda mental reappraisal of our control pro cedures. We have introduced an additional mechanical check to m aintain detailed records of the accrual s tream  by instrum ent, so that when a final principal paym ent is received we  can trace the record a ll the way back on each instrum ent and double check the accounting. More fundam entally and m ore im portantly, what troubles us is how we could have gone for so m any years without scrubbing this ac count m ore vigorously. That is som ething we are looking into and we are going to be revising our control procedures--both the audit procedures and those in our own Markets Gr oup. The Board’s staff and our accounting function at the New York Fed have worked out  an accounting treatm ent to correct for both the $5 m illion and the $2 6.6 m illion errors. That involves red ucing the accrued in terest asset accoun t by the en tire $31.6 m illion, with an  offsetting reduction in in teres t income on foreign cur rency inves tments. We will m ake that  adju stment bef ore the end of  the year and spread it am ong all the Reserve Banks. Of course, for all of us w ith responsibilities f or SOMA this is an em barrassing, indeed hum bling, event. As a technical m atter, though, I understand that PricewaterhouseC oopers is comfortable with the conclusion of both our12/21/99 3 accounting and audit function and the Board staf f that this is not a m aterial event for purposes of disclosure for any Reserve Bank. I would be happy to try to answer any questions. CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Is there any evid ence of a surprising rise in standards of living of key people involved? MR. FISHER. No, there is not. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Has som ebody looked? MR. FISHER. Yes, we have looked into th at. Many of the staff people are still at the Bank, though others are not. But we have found nothing of that nature. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Were it an em bezzlem ent, prior to what p eriod would it have occurred? MR. FISHER. We only know that th e difference existed prio r to Decem ber 1994. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. It could have b een any tim e prior to th at? Is there a beginning point, other than 1914? MR. FISHER. The details certainly don’t exist f or pre-December1994 records, so I don’t know how we could determ ine the beginnin g point--in 1973 or 1963 or where. Prior to 1994, the only interest incom e we were rece iving in that account was com ing from  the BIS, the Bundesbank, and the Bank of Japan. So the source of the income was official institutions. It was really a very sim ple accoun ting process to bring that incom e in at that point; the complexities have been introduced sinc e that tim e. So, as I say, Pricewaterh ouse-Coopers and our audit function are confident in  looking over the control procedures we have had in place that it’s im plausibl e that a diversion could have oc curred. But we cannot rule it out. CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Othe r questions on this issue? Let us go forward to your regular report. MR. FISHER. Turning to the packet of colored charts,1/ page 1 depicts the rates implied by forward rate agr eements. As you can see in the top panel, in the period since your last meeting forward rates rose steadily until the r elease of  the e mploym ent report on De cember 3rd when the market reacted to a lower-than -expect ed average hourly earnings figure, and the forward rates cam e off a little. The rates then bounced backed up again on the release of retail sales data, reaching highs for the year. 1/ A copy of the m aterial used by Mr. Fisher is appended to the transcript. (Appendix 1)12/21/99 4 In the m iddle panel you can see that euro forward rates continued to follow the movem ent in dollar forward ra tes. I think I ha ve been harping on this a ll year, but let m e say it one m ore tim e: To m e, the most unnerving thing in m arkets today is no t the state of equity m arkets, the dollar/yen relationship, or the weakness of the euro, but rather the extent to which Eu ropean in terest rates at the short end  follow the p eaks and valleys of U.S. forward rates. I find it, as I say, unnerving that those rates fall even as the ECB rais es rates and rise  when w e raise rates. It is rea lly very odd and hard to understand. In Japan, as you can see in the botto m panel, the forward rates backed up in m id-Novem ber. But this tim e the Nikkei was rallying and there was increasing anticipation of a strengthe ning recovery. By m id-Nove mber the 9-m onth forward 3-month rate, wh ich as of now covers the fourth quarter of next year, had doubled since October. But with the release of third-quarter GDP number s and the Tankan Survey, those rates began to wind down a bit. However, I should note that Bank of Japan officials have been candid, if m uted, in explaining th at they are beginning to look for an exit s trategy from their z ero interest rate policy, and that is seeping out into th e markets a b it. So there is s till a b it of lift in the J apanese forward rates. Turning to our extraordinary yea r-end operations, on the next page you can see that we have com pleted th e auctions of options on repos, with the final au ction held on Decem ber 1st. If you scan down the page in the colum ns labeled “total propositions,”  “bid-to-cover ra tio” and “awards/ stop-out rate,” you can see that thos e num bers were generally declining over the course of the auctions. In our view that reflected the fact that we did what we said we were going to do: W e tried to m eet dem and--m aybe not each and  every last b id, but th e serious bid s for these op tions. The one exception to  the gene ral declin e in th ese num bers was the last auction of the January 6 strip, as can be seen in the very bo ttom line. Total propositions  jumped up from  $36 billion in the prior week to $43 billion, the bid-to-cover ratio backed up, and th e stop-out rate backed up a little from  2½ to 4 basis points. I don’t w ant to m ake too m uch of that, but I think it reflects an epiphany of so mething going on in the m arkets. The closer we com e to the end of th e year, the m ore the anxieties and uncertainties seem  to be about the fi rst two weeks of Ja nuary--what will be on the other side of the g reat d ivide o f the m illennium --and les s about liquid ity in late Decem ber. That is p rogress at least in on e sense. Turning to the next page, in the top panel you can see the cumulative reserve drain from  currency in circ ulation. The two red dot-dash lines reflect the sam e projectio ns--labeled  “high” and “moderate”--I showed you last tim e. In the m iddle line I’ve  shown the actual experience to date"

I trust you are sufficiently nervous!  [Laughter] MR. FISHER.  Yes, sir. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  We have propos ed changes to the Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations.  Peter, would you review them very briefly for us? MR. FISHER.  Members of the Committee will recall, as Norm Bernard’s memo spelled out, that the authority to sell options on RPs, which the Committee granted the Desk on a temporary basis last August, will expire at the end of this month.  The authority to do reverse RPs and the liberalization of the “Guidelines fo r the Conduct of System Operations in Federal Agency Issues” put in place at the same time w ill run through the end of April, however.  The latter two authorizations will be on the agenda for the Committee to discuss at its March meeting. MR. BERNARD.  There is also the added paragraph relating to the Chairman’s latitude to make intermeeting adjustments to po licy in exceptional circumstances.  The suggested wording is that set forth in Governor Fe rguson’s memorandum of December 17, 1999, which was discussed at the December FOMC meeting.  CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Comments?  Would somebody like to move the proposal?6VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Move approval.   SPEAKER(?).  Second. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  With out objection.

27,20000321,"- 4 -  The chart on the first page de picts three-month deposit rates implied by forward rate agreements.  As you can see in the top panel, forward rates have moved little on balance since the Committee’s previous meeting.  They rose a bit on the Chairman's Humphrey-Hawkins testimony and came off a little toward the end of March, around the time of the strong revision  in fourth-quarter GDP.  But I have a hard time understanding the ca usal connection there, which is why I didn’t include the GDP release date  as a trip wire on the chart.  It does seem that there has been a sl ight increase over the intermeeting period at the short end of the forwar d rate curve, that is, the three-month forward three-month rate, whereas the nine-month forward three-month rate--the top line--has r eally not moved at all on net.  I think the one thing that c ould be said about market expectations is that the markets are anticipating a little more action from the Committee sooner, but the same net amount over the next twelve months.  As you can see in the euro area panel, the one in blue, the ECB raised rates 25 basis points last week  and their forward rates declined ever so slightly.  I think that may reflect something of the same phenomenon in that the ECB was moving a little sooner than the market had been expecting.  In this case that might be reducing slightly the amount of tightening the market is looking for further out.  But there is a lot of noise in these rates, with a lot of seesawing back and forth.  I think the ECB is being unfairly treated.  On the one hand, a lot of analysts are saying that  the ECB is confused, lost, and hopeless.  On the other hand, there is clearly a germ of truth in that assessment.  Members of the policy committee are bringing out their disagreements in the public domain.  Th at there is disagreement is very evident; the markets are not  mistaken about that.    In the bottom panel, you can s ee the slight upward drift in Japanese forward rates since the re lease of their fourth-quarter GDP data.  Over the last few weeks Japa nese officials have been talking up the prospects for growth while trying  to talk down the currency.  That is giving people in the markets a bit of a headache.  The Bank of Japan has intervened since your last mee ting--directed by the Ministry of Finance--buying a total of 9.4 b illion dollars and 700 million euros over the period.   Turning to page 2 and developments in the fed funds market, it’s clear that we've had a rather quiet time of it since your last meeting.  The fed funds market has been remarkably well behaved, with some modest and predictable vol atility at the end of maintenance periods, at month-end, and at tax dates.  So, we have the pleasure of reporting that- 5 -  the effective intermeeting funds rate was 5.75 percent.  It's nice to be both good and lucky!  Mr. Chairman, there were no foreign exchange operations since the last meeting, so at this point I would be happy to answer questions on this portion of my presentation and seek the ratification of our domestic operations since the last meeting.  CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Questions for Pe ter?  If not, would someone like to move approval?  VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Move approval of the domestic operations.   CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.   Without objection. MR. FISHER.  Mr. Chairman, turning to page 3 of my handout, I have outlined some significant changes in conditions in the fixed-income markets over recent months.  Coincide nt with the inversion of the long end of the yield curve, daily volatility of the 30-year bond has risen above the volatility of both the 5- year and 10-year notes.  Ten-year credit spreads have widened to their 1998 highs and beyond; and ten-year spread relationships among priv ate credits have become much less stable.  The bid-ask spreads on Treas ury securities have widened.  And the scarcity value of Treasury secur ities can be seen in lower overnight repo rates.  I have included on the ne xt three pages several charts that I will use to discuss each of these points.    The top panel of page 4 simply shows for background the yields on 5-year, 10-year, and 30-year U. S.  Treasuries since January of 1992.  The middle panel depicts the daily vo latility of U.S. Treasuries on a rolling 50-day interval basis, a nnualized.  You can see the rather extraordinary spike in the volatility of 5- and 10-year notes after the Russian moratorium that was associated with the unwinding of Long-Term Capital Management’s positions.   What is worth noting is the little blip in the red line on the far right side of the chart, showing that for the first time in eight years th e volatility of the 30-year bond is higher than that of either th e 10-year or the 5-year notes.  The bottom panel depicts the corr elation of daily changes in Treasury yields.  Again on the right-hand side you can see the extremely rapid breakdown in the correlation of movements between the 5-year and 30-year issues--the dark blue line--and the 10-year and 30-year issues--the red line.  On th e one hand, looking at this with the benefit of hindsight, we can say th at this type of breakdown is an entirely predictable consequence of an  inversion of the yield curve.  As- 6 -  that process gets under way, we woul d expect to see such a breakdown in correlations within the yield curve.  However, while that is certainly true, the market does not have th e benefit of hindsight when it experiences this.  And the abruptness  of these changes and the rapidity of this breakdown are really a ve ry dramatic altering of pricing relationships that the market has re lied on for many years.  So, I think the suddenness of the breakdown need s to be understood as partly reflecting the fact that the market  is not seeing this breakdown in relationships to the 30-year bond as a transient event, as perhaps some of the other episodes of volatility across the page were.  There is a real question in the minds of market partic ipants as to whether relationships with the 30-year bond will be re-establis hed to levels that have been the norm for the last quarter of a century.      In the top panel on the next page  are three credit spreads to the   10-year Treasuries.  A corporate sp read, using the Me rrill Lynch A-2 index, is shown in red; a swap spread  is in dark blue; and an agency spread, with the Bloomberg index of  noncallable debt--that is, their straight 10-year debt--is in light bl ue.  You can see that recently these spreads have widened out to and beyond the levels they reached in the fall of 1998.  Looking now at the whole eight years’ worth of data, the adjustment of spreads since 1998 lo oks to me much less like a one-time shock or even a series of shocks  and a little more like a resetting of spreads at higher levels.  Indee d, since the fall of 1998, all three of these spreads have traded at r oughly double the averages that had prevailed from 1994 to August 1998.  It ’s a little under that, but a rough approximation is that those spreads have almost doubled.  Clearly, some of this can be attrib uted directly to the decline in Treasury yields resulting from th e cutbacks in Treasury issuance, particularly more recently.  But I also  think there is an indirect impact of the supply/demand imbalance on the confidence with which market participants price credit risks.  One way I have tried to think of it is that the changed supply outlook for Treasuries has introduced a fair amount of noise into the Treasury yiel d curve.  As a consequence, the efficiency of our most basic measurement device for credit risk has been significantly disturbed.  And in that environment, one might expect a heightened uncertainty premium to be built into all credit spreads.  And at least in  part, I think that is wh at we are looking at in the top panel.  In the middle panel I have depict ed the correlation of weekly changes in the spreads of the corpor ate swap and agency indexes to the 10-year Treasury.  Again, you can see that the Treasury/agency breakdown is rather abrupt.  In th e bottom panel is depicted what I"
28,20000516,"4CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Peter Fi sher, you are on.  Where are you? MR. FISHER.  Over here, Mr. Chairman!  [L aughter]   There is a package of charts and text in front of you, which on the firs t page has a summary of my remarks. 1  Let me apologize in advance for th e length of my report.  I will try to cut to the chase.  Also, I s hould note that all the typos in the written material are my own, as yest erday I engaged in the illusion that last-minute changes result in improvements.   I will discuss domestic market developments with respect to policy expectations in short-term ra tes, movements in the euro as a consequence of capital flow leads an d lags, and the current shape of U.S. yield curves.  With respect to domestic operations I plan to cover four topics, including the mix of operations since the previous meeting, current conditions in the Treasury market, and the impact of Federal revenues and Treasury refunding plans on the flow of new Treasury issuance and System operations.  Then I woul d like to present to the Committee a proposal for interim System operati ons that I’d like to discuss with the Treasury.  And at the end of my remarks I will remind you about some foreign matters on which I sent you a memo.  Turning to the second page of the package, which shows forward rates, you can see in the top panel th at U.S. forward rates have risen sharply since mid-April, when they had dipped a little following the release of the CPI and more impor tantly the stock market turmoil around mid-month.  Since then they  have moved up, most briskly on the release of the ECI on April 27th and then again a little on the publication of the nonfarm payroll report on May 5th.  It is interesting to note, however, that compared with  the peak of these forward rates just after your last meeting, the 9-month forward 3-month rate-- the top dashed line--is only 25 basis points higher whereas the 6-month forward 3-month rate--the solid red line--is 45 basis points  higher.  There is some “collapsing in” of the market’s expectations of how far the Committee is likely to go in tight ening, even as more aggressive actions are being priced in over the near term.  In the middle panel, you can see that euro forward rates have backed up from their low levels in essentially three steps over the period.  First, they moved up as the euro broke below 95 cents; then they rose quite modestly after the ECB raised rates 25 basis points on April 27th and rose again after the May 2nd release of euro area M3                                                  1 A copy of the material used by Mr. Fish er is appended to this transcript.5and the purchasing managers’ index.  The market certainly has a sense of backing up and raising forward ra tes in Europe as the euro has weakened.  The bottom panel depicts Japanese forward rates, which have drifted lower over most of the in termeeting period and spiked down on the release of the negative hous ehold spending number on May 9th.  It has been my impression during this period that the Bank of Japan has been waving its arms in the air, tr ying to get people’s attention and communicate that it might actually rais e rates at some point.  I think the market is under-assessing the ear nestness with which the Bank of Japan is trying to send that signal.  It is very much my sense that Bank officials feel somewhat as our Chairman did in 1993 and early 1994:  They are trying to warn everyone th at a rate increase is coming and no one is listening.  Turning to page 3, I would like to  talk a little about the euro’s weakness, which I see as a function of two factors.  The principal factor is the exceptional leads and lags in capital fl ows, which have been punctuated, if you will, by the extraordinary cyclical developments in the United States ov er the last couple of years.  Each of the three panels shows data fo r the 17-month period on either side of the January 1, 1999 launch of the euro.  The top panel depicts        2- and 10-year U. S. and German sw ap rates and a 10-year Italian rate up until the launch of the euro, and then the dollar and euro rates after that time.  In the middle panel are the euro/yen and euro/dollar exchange rates.  And the bottom pa nel shows the Italian stock market in purple, the S&P 500 in red, and the German stock market in blue, all indexed to August 1, 1997.  Looking back over this period, it s eems to me that non-European investors bought the rumor of the eu ro before its launch.  You can see that in the rally in Italian and Ge rman 10-year swap rates and also somewhat in the Italian and German  equity markets in late 1997 and into 1998.  And talking to people ov er that time period, there were anecdotal reports of a flow of non-Eu ropean capital into the euro zone as investors bought the rumor of the creation of the euro.  During this same period, euro-zone businesses braced themselves for the launch of the euro by hoarding cash.  Many of  us no doubt remember Governor Trichet of the Bank of France complaining repeatedly about how their corporate sector was hanging on to high levels of cash--building up a war chest for the more competitive environment they expected with the launch of the euro--rather than investing.  Since the introduction of the eu ro, it appears that European businesses have actually been diversif ying out of the euro area, as FDI6and portfolio flows away from the eu ro zone have picked up.  That seems to me to reflect an effort on their part to catch up with the process of globalization and divers ification that has seen U.S. corporations at the forefront.  Now,  inward investors into the euro area--and the intermedia ries who bought the euro exposure from the outward investors--all hung on, wa iting for the strong euro to materialize around the start of this y ear and expecting finally to get the rally they had been looking for.  But this was just when U.S. cyclical developments gave them the “double whammy,” if you will.  The last quarter of 1998, as investors were anticipating the launch of the euro, was just when this Committee was easing rates.    There was much excitement a bout whether there would be an economic slowdown and there were stra ins in the markets.  At that point the spread between 10-year U.S. and German swap rates stood at 80 basis points and the spread between  their 2-year swap rates stood at 120 basis points.  Since then those swap spreads have doubled.  The 10-year U.S./euro swap spread is  190 basis points and the 2-year spread is 240 basis points.  While those who were hanging on to euros were hoping for the euro to rally and the U.S. economy to slow down, just the reverse has happened.  If you look at the bottom panel and the recent equity rally, you can see that the one place from wh ich U.S. equity values might look cheap would be Milan; that is just one of the head fakes that occurred to the exchange market.  Everyone expected that the hiccup of the NASDAQ in U.S. equity markets in April might be the occasion to spark a rally in the euro.  On the contrary, it appears that European businessmen, looking at their mark et valuations vis-à-vis U.S. valuations, saw that hiccup as a buying opportunity.  And from the newspapers, which one has to follow to see these developments before they get picked up in the data, one can read about a continued flow of deals involving European pur chases of U.S. assets.  The euro bounced up at the end of last week amid a hail of discussion and threats of interventi on by prime minist ers and central bankers and finance ministers from  all over Europe; but the bounce was not much more than one would ha ve predicted even  without all of that rhetoric.  To me, the fact th at it got only that rather marginal bounce was again a somewhat bearish sign for the euro.   Let me briefly cover the material  on domestic yield curves on page 4.  These are the charts I ha ve shown you before on yield curves for U.S. Treasury securities, intere st rate swaps, Fannie Mae issues, and Ford Motor Company debt.  The yield curves shown are as of the close of the day of your last meeti ng and as of last Friday. As you can"
29,20000628,"4to narrow and reverse over the comi ng year, the short-term interest rate markets do not seem to share that assessment.  If they did, it would seem to me that the euro  forward rates would show more forward upward lift than they do.  At the bottom of the page, you can see that the Japanese forward rates have begun to tick up again of late as the melodrama continues about whether the Bank of Japan will or won't raise rates sometime soon.  The speculation regarding a rate increase goes on apace and we see again the modest ticking up of forward rates.  Turning to the second page, it is clear that over the last four maintenance periods the fed funds rate has behaved rather well, trading right around the target with ve ry low volatility since your last meeting.  There really isn't much interest or excitement in our management of the funds rate per se.  As you can see on page 3, however, behind the veil of a nice stable funds rate is a rather  different development having to do with the scarcity of Treasur y collateral beginning to show through in the repo markets.  Depict ed on the chart in red is the  30-day moving average of the sp read between the repo rate on general collateral for Treasury secur ities and the fed funds rate as we get a snapshot of it each morning.  The solid blue lines represent 6-month averages ove r the periods encompassed by those blue horizontal lines.  Clear ly, over the last two years that average has been trending lower, with a widening of the negative spread at which Treasury collate ral trades under the funds rate.  Two developments have in all likelihood taken place here.  One is the scarcity of Treasury co llateral; it is at a premium and will trade under the funds rate.  There is also an element of defensiveness among the major institutional investors and money managers during a period when the Committee has been tightening, as they look for the safe ty of Treasury collateral.  But to my mind the march down of thos e average rates is impressive.  And I will note that one major dealer  has said to me that they can fund themselves at 50 basis point s under the funds rate with Treasury collateral, so acute is de mand of their customer base for Treasuries as a safe haven cash management vehicle.  On the fourth page I have tried to summarize our reserve management operations this year as they relate both to the growth of reserve needs and the mix betw een outright and RP operations.  I used as my base here the February 9th maintenance period, which gets us out of the year-end effects of the seasonal and the Y2K5buildup of cash and to a reasonable starting point for a base case.  In the top part of the page I have shown changes in supply of Fed balances from the February 9th pe riod to the current June 28th maintenance period.  Autonomous fa ctors have drained a little over $1 billion net over that period of  time; that’s overwhelmingly comprised of currency.  We have had redemptions of $4.9 billion since that time, adding to reserve needs.  And $6.9 billion has been added through SOMA purchases plus net changes in RPs over that period, leaving us a very margin al change in the total of nonborrowed Fed balances.  Let me first work down the page  rather than across; I will come back to the figures at the upper right in a moment.  The mix of activity involved in getting to that marginal change included outright purchases, here expressed in par values, from the end of January through June of $12.9 bill ion in Treasury securities, distributed as shown in the middle table on the page.  Moving down to the next set of figures, we had a mix of a little over $11 billion in short-term RPs of under 15 days and $8-1/2 billion of long-term RPs in the February 9th period, fo r a total of nearly $20 billion outstanding at the beginning of Fe bruary.  We have decreased the amount of short-term RPs and in creased the amount of long-term RPs, so that currently the level of RPs outstanding is $2.6 billion under 15 days--but that number  bounces around every day--and $14 billion in longer-term RPs.  At the bottom of the page is a memo item giving the mix of collateral that we had in February  compared with what we have today.  Currently 42 percent of the collateral we have in the 15-day or longer RPs is Treasury collateral,  16 percent is agency debt, and 42 percent is mortgage-backed securities.  Going back to the top of the page, at the upper right I have shown projected reserve factors for the period from now to the September 6th maintenance period, which begins just about the time of your next meeting.  We expect a little over $8 billion to be drained by currency, but over $15 bill ion to be drained as a result of net redemptions, principally from the 35 percent limit being applied to bills.  That leaves us with a need to add about $23 billion on net from now until the beginning of September.  There is one other issue with  respect to Treasury supply that I would like to mention.  It just  occurred to me that this is a matter that may become public be fore your next meeting.  For over 20 years the Treasury has given foreign central banks preferred access, if you will, to the auction process in Treasury6securities, providing a mechanism through us for those institutions to bid in the auction.  They have an “add on” in that they can always get their need s filled in the auctions.   This has created a problem for the Treasury in an era of declining issuance in that the Trea sury can end up with more cash than it actually wants as the fore ign central banks exercise their right to add on to the auction.  The Treasury is very anxious to find a way to end this process, which gives them some uncertainty about the amount of cash they will raise.  They are trying to cap the amount the foreign central banks can bid for in the auction at a set dollar figure, and they would like to cap that amount at a rather low level. No matter how you slice this--and we are working with the Treasury to come up with different formulas--the big accounts will have to find some way of bidding for Treasury securities other than through the noncom petitive foreign accounts mechanism.  That is something we do for the Japanese, for example.  We at the Desk ar e working with the Treasury to try to find a way to take care of the very small accounts--those of the developing economies all over the world that have very small cash balances and want to reinvest in bills.  We are attempting to come up with a procedure that will ensure that those countries are taken care of through an automatic process but one that will require the big countries to look elsewhere.   This is overwhelmingly an issu e involving the Ministry of Finance of Japan.  It means finding some way for them to deal with their rather large investment needs, which they like to park in the short end of the market.  Both the domestic and the international sides of the Treasur y have been working on this and we have been giving them techni cal advice on different ways that it could be worked out.  I don't know how it will be worked out, but it is likely that the Treasury will want to announce something in conjunction with their refunding at the beginning of August--at least that is when I understand th ey would like to move forward with this.  So I just wanted to warn you of that upcoming event.  Mr. Chairman, we had no foreign exchange interventions in the intermeeting period.  I will need a vote to ratify our domestic operations since your last meeting.  We distributed copies of the draft announcement summarizing the operational changes we discussed at the Comm ittee’s last meeting and, as my note explained, we've gone over these with the Treasury.  In addition to any questions on my  briefing, I would be happy to take any comments or suggestions on that document, which the Committee members may now have.  Thank you."
30,20000822,"4euro’s history that those rates have moved in an opposite trend from our forward rates for an extended period of time.  Recent ECB musings and their bulletin about inflation risks pushed the rates up most recently.  In the bottom panel on the page, you  can see that the Bank of Japan finally did it--raising their rate s, as everyone knows, on the 11th of August.   I think it is worth going back over so me ground here.  Forward rates and current deposit rates in Japan backed up in late June as they have every year for the last several years, as all the contracts st art to incorporate forward period-end dates--the fiscal half-year ending in September, the calendar year-end in December, and the fiscal year-end in March.  And that elevated all the deposit rates as it has very consistently for the last several years.  They remained elevated into  early July, as the market began to anticipate a Bank of Japan move at its  July meeting.  Then with the Sogo bankruptcy just a few days before that July 17th meeting, the rates came off as the market concluded the BOJ wouldn’ t be moving in the event.  Indeed, the decision was for no change in rate s. Then rates began to price up in anticipation of the meeting on August 11th when in fact the BOJ did raise rates.  One point worth noting is how much steeper the rise in the current  3-month deposit rate was than the antici pation.  I think that reflects the fact that Tokyo bankers have for the first ti me in a decade had to deal with an increase in rates and how to price deposits in such an environment.   Turning to the next page, I thought I’ d briefly discuss the plight of the euro.  The top panel shows the 10-year  and 2-year dollar and euro swap rates and the middle panel depicts the differential between those rates--the 2-year and the 10-year dollar/euro di fferentials. And in the bottom panel I have plotted the euro exchange rate s against both the dollar and the yen.  Since the start of May, the 2-year differential has narrowed almost 100 basis points, approximately half due to our rates coming down and half to theirs going up.  The 10-year differential has narrowed almost entirely as a consequence of our rate coming down, w ith only a very little uptick in their 10-year rate.  While the initial narro wing of these differentials coincided with the euro’s brief rally off historic  lows in May, at first appearance the more recent narrowing in interest rate differentials seems to have done little for the euro.  The euro has drifted back down to its springtime lows and was trading below 90 again this morni ng.  I think a bett er interpretation, looking back, is that in a ll likelihood the euro would have been a great deal weaker had these interest rate differe ntials not narrowed as they did.    Forecasts for euro-area growth have been revised up to around, and in some cases even above, 3-1/2 percent, while forecasts of U.S. growth have tended to be revised down toward that  neighborhood, just north of 3-1/2 percent.  Many market pa rticipants, myself included, had long expected that a convergence of antic ipated growth rates and the erasing of a growth5differential would be the signal for a strengthening of the euro.  But that has not been the case.  I think Europe an business confidence continues to express itself in a quest for outward investment, particularly into North America.  And the capital markets in general have been mesmerized by the graceful moderation of growth in the United States and the continued productivity gains, both of which for the time being are reflected in the strength of the dollar.  On the next page, I have depicted th e four domestic yi eld curves that I show you from time-to-time--those for U.S.  Treasuries, interest rate swaps, Fannie Mae, and the Ford Motor Company--on three selected dates.  In green is the yield curve in July of la st year, in blue the curve on the day after your February meeting, and in red the most recent reading as of last Friday.  Most are noticeably lower than they were in early February of this year.  The one exception is Ford Motor Company’s yield curve, which is almost identical to where it was in Febr uary.  But I think it’s important to note that that is not only fairly typica l of corporate yields  but also probably reflects the strength of issuance we’v e had over the last few months.  So that outlier is more likel y indicative of a supply eff ect than a market-driven expectation for interest rates.  Turning to page 4, I thought I’d briefly go over the impact of the announcement we made in July of th e changes in our operations with respect to outright purchases.  We announced on July 5th that we would tend to concentrate more on outrigh t purchases for the System Open Market Account at the short end of th e yield curve and lean more toward purchasing off-the-run issues and limiti ng our participation in the primary market.  The top panel shows the euro dollar futures strip for September and December 2000 and for March 2001 as background, in terms of policy and macroeconomic expectations.  The middl e panel depicts 2-year and 10-year Treasury yields, which you can see follow a more or less consistent pattern.    From the time of our announcement on July 5th, 2-year yields did outperform 10-year yields very marginal ly until the auction of the new    10-year issue on August 9th, when the relationship began to reverse.  But this behavior is really consistent with the economic data the market was seeing and with our announcement that  we would be buying more in the short end.  Those factors may have give n a slight boost to the short end of the yield curve, but it’s very hard to parse that out from the policy impact.  The short end was rallying across the curv e, as you can see in the top panel.  In the bottom panel, I’ve depicted  one measure of the differential between on-the-run and off-the-run yiel ds in the Treasury market.  Here it is a little easier to see that our a nnouncement had an impact.  After July 5th you can see a narrowing of these spreads.  There is a lot of noise in this6series, especially as we come up to the new auction where the cycle will change and a new 10-year issue will come into the market.  But we did seem to have an impact, as we expected.  We hoped to avoid having much of an impact on the shape of the yield curve, and I think we succeeded, but our announcement did seem to affect the off-the-run spreads.  Turning to page 5, let me go ove r our operations since the last meeting.  At the time of your July  meeting our rese rve needs were projected to grow as a consequence of economic factors by a little over $8 billion in the intermeeting period, as indicated in the first column of numbers. We expected to redeem  about $15 billion net of Treasury securities, so that was going to add to  our reserve needs.  And then, given our forecast of a slight decline in total nonborrowed Fed balances, we thought we’d have to do about $22 to $23 billion in combined repo and outright operations.    The next column depicts where we were in fact through yesterday.  The autonomous factors drained fewer re serves than we anticipated.  Most of the $6.2 billion differen tial between our forecast  and the actual was a result of less demand for currency than we expected.  Our redemptions were somewhat lower at $12 billion, not $15 billion.  The Treasury upped the size of its bill offerings a bit and that reduced how much we were going to redeem under our 35 percent limit.  Thus we had less of a need to add reserves than we had expected, $14 billion rather than $22 billion.    Looking forward to the next in termeeting period through early October, we are expecting autonom ous factors to drain about $4-1/2 billion, SOMA redemptions to be about  $5-1/2 billion, and our need from September 6th forward to grow by about $9 billion.    On the next page in the top table, the numbers in the left-hand column are the ones I showed you last time, indicating that we purchased about $12.8 billion in outright securities from  January through June.  So, in the first half of the year we purchased a little over $12-3/4 bill ion.  Just in the past intermeeting period we purchased  $12-1/2 billion--rather aggressive on our part.  But under our new guidelin es we thought that was manageable and we did that.  In the table below you can see that the average level of repos outstanding, with the shift in reserve needs less steep than we expected, has declined to about $11.5 b illion, in contrast to $16.5 billion in the period ending June 28th.    Looking forward, I don’t think we’ll try to buy another $12 billion in Treasury securities between now a nd your next meeting.  But in all likelihood we will try to purchase some thing on the order of $10 billion by your November meeting, probably doing $5 billion between now and the"
31,20001003,"4have traded into the forward rate matu rities, but the overall levels are little changed.   On the next page I have shown some  long-term rates.  The top panel shows U.S. Treasury yields on 2-year , 10-year, and 30-year securities and the bottom panel has the U.S. and euro sw ap rates for those same maturities.  In the top panel you can see that from August 31st through last Friday, the latest date depicted there, 2-year Tr easury yields declined by about 18 basis points.  Those expecting a slowdown in economic activity have eagerly cited this as evidence supporting th at outlook.  Both 10- and 30-year Treasury yields backed up, with 30-year  yields trading a bove 10-year yields for the first time since January, and th is has been eagerly cited by those who have been concerned about inflation risks.  Now, I don’t want to downplay concerns about inflation, which are wi dely being discussed in the market, particularly with reference to the volat ility in oil prices.  But the modest backup in yields on 10- and 30-year Treasuries did appe ar to coincide with a heavy pace of new corporate issuan ce and with indications from the campaign trail and the Congress that bot h major political parties might yet find a way to spend some of the surplus.  Moreover, in the top part of the bottom panel, you can see that swap rates show a slightly different and less pronounced trajectory.  The 2-year swap rate, like the 2-year Treasury yi eld, fell by 18 basis points from August 31st through last Friday.  But the 10-year  swap rate fell 8 basis points while the 30-year swap rate was unchanged.  At the bottom of the page you can see that euro swap rates, at lower levels, roughly tracked the movements in U.S. 10- and 30-year swaps, with the 2-year euro declining 17 basis poin ts and the 10-year declining 5 basis points.  But the 30-year euro swap b acked up by 11 basis points.  Thus, both the dollar and the euro 2- to 30-year  swap curves steepened by 19 basis points from August 31st through last Friday.  But on the dollar side, all of the widening occurred by falling 2-year rate s, while on the euro side it was divided between a fall in the 2-year rate  and a rise in the 30-year rate.    These relative movements in U.S. and euro area swap curves not only reflect but reinforce the perception that while growth in the United States may be slowing--with the risk of an uptick of inflation, perhaps from oil prices among other things--that in Europe is slowing also.  And the slowdown in Europe is from lower le vels of growth, while the uptick in inflation could perhaps be of a greater  magnitude from the combination of rising oil prices and the falling euro.  Turning to the next page and directly  to exchange rates, you can see in the top panel the percent change since May 1st in the three major currency pairs.  The bottom panel depicts implied volatilities of one-month options5for those same pairs.  We should rec ognize, of course, that the dollar has been strong against a number of curr encies for some time.  But over the course of the summer and into Septem ber, among the three major currencies I think we clearly have a problem of a weak and volatile euro, particularly against the yen.  The red line showing the euro/yen rate leads the way lower in the top panel, as the spot rate has traded dow n, and the way higher in implied volatility in the bottom panel.   The dollar/yen line, in blue, is remarkably stable across the top panel, with declining implied volatility in September.    Why did the euro come under such pre ssure in September?  I see three reasons that work together.  First, in anticipation of the Ja panese fiscal half-year-end statement date on September 30th, Japanese investors were seeking to reduce or hedge their euro exposures.  Second, in a market with this ready class of euro sellers, there were some  very confused policy signals sent by the Europeans.  On September 5th Chancellor Schroede r in a prepared speech said that the current euro/dollar exchange rate is more of a reason to be happy than concerned.  The ensuing cacophony of official utterances drew attention to the lack of a clear  voice on euro exchange rate policy and made the euro’s exchange rate an increasingly political issue.  The third factor was the ECB’s mistake, in my  view, of announcing on September 14th that it would sell accumulated interest  on its foreign exchange reserves, amounting to 2.5 billion euros, and that in the future it would consistently sell interest income.  I want to be clea r that I don’t think that’s a mistake in principle; in principle that ’s a fine thing for a central bank to do.  But timing is everything.  I’m confident that the ECB thought that with this device they could intervene a little w ithout exposing themselves to  the credibility loss of an actual intervention.  From my way of thinking, by taking an insufficient amount of funds to make a difference in the market, they sent a muted and garbled signal of a “noni ntervention” intervention .  And they created the risk of inducing more euro sellers to come into the market by announcing their intention to buy.  Why did we join the inte rvention on Friday the 22nd?  The short answer is                                                                       virtually every important condition that we spelled out.  At the start of that week,6                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     was informed Thursday evening, while the                                                                        details of the agreement were           wor                           being               ked out, that Secr etary Summers would state on Friday after the operation that U.S. foreign exchange policy remained unchanged and that a strong dollar is in our natio nal interest.         Turning to the operation itself, you can see in the bottom portion of this last page various rates at certain select ed times from Wednesday September 20th through last Friday.  I’d like to make three points about th e joint intervention operation.  Sadly, the operation appears, at least to my cynical eyes, to have been anticipated by some in the market.  From Wednesday’s close to Thursday’s close, the euro rose more than a cent, and it ro se another cent from Thursday’s close to 7"
32,20001115,"4a bit, as have the dollar and the euro rates, but on their rather suppressed scale.  Turning to the second page, I have  included two charts depicting exchange rates.  In the top panel,  going back to May of 1999 again, are changes in the foreign currency values of our four major trading partners--movements in the Japanese yen, the Me xican peso, the Canadian dollar, and the euro against the dollar.  In the bottom panel are comparable changes in the currencies of five smaller countries.  Looking at the top panel, you can see that the yen stre ngthened quite a bit against the dollar last year but is r eally very little cha nged this year.  The peso and the Canadian dollar are down slightly over this period, but rather marginally so.  And the euro has lost  20 percent of its value against the dollar, mostly this year.  Of the five currencies shown in the bottom panel, all but the Korean won, which is certainly something of an  exception, have d eclined quite a bit against the dollar, principally this ye ar.  Those currencies include the New Zealand dollar, the rand, the Austra lian dollar, and the Thai baht.  Now, however we may feel about th e dollar's movements and whatever our analytic framework, I think we s hould recognize that the movements of the euro and several currencies of sm aller countries agai nst the dollar are viewed by people elsewhere in the worl d as extreme or extraordinary.  And they are seen by our counterparts in ot her countries as refl ecting a drawing in of capital into the United States and safe  haven flows that persist on the order of those experienced in 1997 and 1998.  We may not see it that way.  We think there is a distinction between what has been going on this year and what occurred in those prior years.  Bu t they see it as a continuation of those safe haven and capital flows into the United States.  So, while one can point to significant differentiation in the pressure on different countries--for example, the Ar gentine peso is under pressure but the Hong Kong dollar is no t--the dollar's strength is not seen by the rest of the world as a consequence of the fundamental s.  Rather, the dollar’s strength is seen as a cause of their problems and th e stress that besets their economies.  That view is held much more firm ly now, I think, than in 1997 and 1998 when other nations tended to understand th e nature of the safe haven flows.  This continuation of capital movement s into the United States now seems more mysterious to our count erparts in other countries.  On page 3, I have provided four sn apshots of three different yield curves.  Those snapshots are for the following dates:  May 3rd of 1999, before the Committee's recent tightening cycle began; January 10th of this year,5which was just prior to the Treasury’s buyback announcement and when the yield curve began to invert; May 16th, the last occasion the Committee changed rates; and November 13th, this past Monday.  Each red diamond reflects a Treasury issue.  The gap for the period between 10 and 14 years reflects the fact that for this exercise the callables have been located on their call date and not their maturity date.  So we've shifted all those maturities down.  I'd make four observations from l ooking at these comparisons.  In the chart for November 13th, while the slope of the A- 2 industrial corporate index is roughly the same now as it was in May of 1999, it is clear that the yield curve has shifted 100 basis points higher.  So over that time horizon we see a certain tightening of financial conditions , at least for this credit grade.  Secondly, however, the short end of th e corporate curve is considerably lower now than it was in May or in Janua ry of this year.  So, over that time horizon, for this credit grade you woul d see a certain easing of financial conditions.  Third, the widening of the cor porate spread to Treasuries of this index actually occurred between Ja nuary and May--between the dates depicted at the upper right and the lo wer left.  And there's really only a modest uptick in the widening of their spread to Treasuries from May to now for this higher grade.  We know that lower grade credits have deteriorated over this period, but I found it quite signi ficant to realize that the widening relative to this higher credit grade occurred in the first half of the year.  Finally, the most noteworthy movement  on these panels is the collapse of the short end of the Treasury cu rve, which occurs between May and November, with the hump out to two years completely inverting and coming down.  Clearly, this reflects the anticip ation of easing, which has increasingly been priced into the markets over the summer and into the fall, reflecting the markets’ reading of the data.  You pay me  in part to worry.  I must say that I do have a small worry that we will neve r know what part of this collapse of the hump was caused by our change with  respect to our outright operations.  About $30 billion of the $37 billion of out rights we purchased this year have been in maturities of five years and under.  Now, we’ll never know the counterfactual.  But I believe had we continued to purchas e evenly across the curve, that we might have had a mo re profound effect on the long end, where conditions were getting thinner a nd where the Treasury was buying back issues.  So there was no free lunch here fo r us.  I want to be  clear that I think the predominant movement in the shor t end should be attributed to the markets’ pricing in the ease based on the fundamentals.  But it's not without some anxiety that I note our own operati ons could have played a small part.  Turning to the next page, let me ju st go over the current status of our operations.  In the top po rtion of this table we show the changes in our forecast looking forward to the year-e nd.  There has been relatively little6change in our forecast of reserve needs from late September to now.  Things seem to be coming in pretty much as expected.  I’ll actually come back to these in a minute; I have a better pict ure of our projections on the next page.  In the middle of page 4 you can see details on our outright purchases.  We had purchased a little more than  $32 billion through early October and we have purchased another $5 billion since then.  And you can see how much has been in the short end, following the guidelines we adopted in July.  In the bottom panel you can see that th e average level of our short-term RPs in the current November, shown in  the right column, is running about $3 billion.  We’ve started to increase th e longer-term book a li ttle, anticipating a year-end average of almost $13 billion.  In the bottom part of the table on RPs you can see that the mix of colla teral we are taking now is still predominantly Treasury debt, at 64 per cent.  The rest is divided between agency debt and mortgage-backed securities.  Turning to the last page, I’ve tried to give you a sense of how we plan to manage reserves around year-end.  In  the top panel we've depicted factors draining reserves from the system.  The orange line shows the impact of changes in autonomous factors, princi pally currency.  The green line shows the additional drain occurring as a consequence of our cumulative redemptions, here all based on changes from October 3rd.  As you can see, we are expecting a drain of about $30 billi on as we get into the year-end period.  The bottom panel gives you a sense of  how we’ve been managing this reserve need and how we plan to ma nage it.  The dots represent actual operations and the solid lines give a se nse of our forecast. Working up from the bottom of that page, we plan to buy another $5 billion outright between now and the year-end, meeting part of th e reserve needs that way.  We expect to increase our 28-day book of repos to a peak of $24 billion at year-end and then begin unwinding that.  And on our current forecast we will have about $6 billion outstanding of temporary s hort-term RPs at year-end.  I don't yet have any precise forecast, and I wouldn't pretend to, of how we will manage that on the other side of the year-e nd.  But the 28-day book will start to unwind and we’ll see where we are. We ’d then begin accumulating outrights, but I think I'll wait to see how things evolve before making a forecast for that.  I’ve mentioned to the Committee th at the Treasury was planning to announce a change in the bidding rules fo r our foreign accounts.  They made that announcement yesterday.  I think it went rather well.  We’ve worked with the Japanese authorities and I thi nk their comfort level with respect to this change is now much higher.  We are in a position to help manage their participation in competitive auctions next year by working very closely with"
33,20001219,"4panel, which at first glance appear to be treading water.  However, I think the convergence of the 3-mont h forward and the 9-month forward rates in the last few weeks does re flect an unwinding of the modest hopes for an accelerating economy over the next year.  The current 3-month yen deposit rate has ticked up on funding pressures, reflecting the combination of the Bank of Japan's new payments system--launched at the beginning of the y ear--and the normal fiscal year-end financing requirements associated with the first calendar quarter, which is their last fiscal quarter.  In the top panel of the next page  you can see movements in the U.S. Treasury yield curve, with the 2-year  note in red, the 10-year note in blue, and the 30-year bond in green.  These yields have moved down in roughly the same pattern as the forward rates, with the rate on 2- and 10-year notes having come down by just less than 60 basis points each since your last meeting.  In the bottom panel I've depicted the differential between dollar and euro swap rates--the 2-year differen tial in red and the 10-year in blue.  The dramatic narrowing of the latter since the Chairman's speech to the Community Bankers has been explaine d as reflecting expectations of a more pronounced slowing in the U.S. economy as compared with Europe.  While that perception is around, focusing on the 10-year sector seems to me to overstate the change in  the relative outlooks.  If there had been a sharp divergence in growth  expectations, one might have expected to see a bit more of it reflec ted in the 2-year rates.  While the 2-year differential has narrowed by a bout 20 basis points since your last meeting, that is considerably less than  the narrowing of 46 basis point in the 10-year differential.  The explan ation I have been offered by market participants is that the pronounced fa ll in 10-year swap rates reflects the needs of those who manage mortgage portfolios and have  to extend their portfolio's duration as interest rates decline in order to  hedge prepayment risks.  And with thinning Treasury markets, these portfolio managers increasingly look to agency securities  and the swap market as additional sources of liquidity to complete their hedging.  In effect, the more pronounced na rrowing of the 10-year swap differential reflects the greater extent  to which the agency financing of the housing stock is marked to mark et on a daily basis here in North America as compared with Europe.  Two-year rates may yet prove to be a lagging indicator, or th e short end of our yield curve may yet decline by more than the market now expect s.  But as long as the 2-year differential remains over 100 basis points  in the dollar's favor, it is hard for me to think that market par ticipants are expecting markedly diverging growth paths for Europe and North America.5On page 3 I've provided a set of ch arts on yield curves similar to the charts I showed you at the last mee ting, this time with addition of the BB1 industrial corporate index.  At the upper left is the yield curve as of May 16th, the day the Committee last raised  rates.  The upper right panel shows yields just after your November 15th meeting.  The lower left panel is for November 28th, after the release of th e durable goods orders data, and the lower right one is for December 15th, after the CPI release.  Looking from the upper right to the lower right--comparing rates at the end of the day of your last mee ting to today--you can see that the U.S. Treasury yield curve has moved noticeably lower.  One might say that the 2- to 30-year curve now hove rs around the central tendency of 5-1/2 percent, 100 basis points under th e funds rate.  The swap curve over that maturity range has been pulled completely below the funds rate.  And 2-year A2 industrial corporat e paper yields the same as the overnight rate. The BB1 yields ha ve moved appreciably lower, by 50 basis points in the 2-, 5- , and 10-year maturities since the time of your last meeting.    Now, with the short ends outperforming the long ends and the better credits outperforming the lesser credits  at the long end, what seems to me to be happening is that very differe nt sets of concerns in the markets at the moment are converging in te rms of investor behavior.  From whatever their different starting poin ts, investors are tending to shorten duration and move into the higher qu ality credits.  Those who expect a pronounced and enduring slowdown of activity expect a considerable easing of monetary policy and thus are positioning themselves to enjoy a rally in the short end of the yield curve.  Those who think the current slowdown may only be a pause are concerned about the potential volatility of GDP and thus are tending  to reduce their duration in order to minimize their exposure to the long end.  Those who are concerned about corporate earnings strains a nd deteriorating credit quality are fearful of corporate event risks and are reducing the maturity of their credit exposures while shifting into  better credits.  Those who have finished their risk-taking for the year  because they have a sufficiency of either gains or losses, have positioned themselv es into the short end while they await next year’s opportuniti es.  As the short end of the curve and the better credits across the curve have rall ied, the hedging by mortgage portfolio managers ha s accelerated the movement down.  On the other side are those who think that interest rates, or at least some portion of the 2- to 30-year cu rve, are at or near their bottom because the soft landing will be achiev ed.  In their view any pause in activity will be quite brief or may ev en be over.  These accounts have been content to sell Treasury securi ties and swap contracts to the eager buyers.  Implicit in this view is th e intriguing idea that the market has6not only led the Fed but that the ma rket has lapped the Fed.  Even as they expect the Committee to lower shor t-term rates, they expect longer-term rates to be steady or rising.  Al l of these views are usually reduced to the simple dichotomy between those who expect a hard landing and those who expect a soft one.  On th e one hand are those who anticipate a pronounced weakness in demand and a deterioration of credit, and on the other are those who think activity will stabilize or pick up and that credit spreads will normalize once we pass through the typical year-end seasonal risk aversion.    Turning to page 4, you can see some extraordinary movements in the commercial paper market.  In th e top chart are spreads of A2/P2 30-day commercial paper over the A1/P1 paper for all borrowers, financial and nonfinancial, from September through February of each year since 1996.  In the bottom chart are comparable data for 90-day commercial paper.  In both cases the heavy red line represents those spreads over the period since September of this year.   Clearly, the pattern in 2000 is  outside the range of recent experience, reflecting something mo re than normal risk aversion associated with the window-dressing  of year-end balance sheets.  In talking to those in the commercia l paper market, one does not get a sense of crisis in the A2/P2 market.  But there is a rather strong sense of saturation of higher risk assets.  Port folios that might have carried A2/P2 paper through the year-end have more than their fill of telecom paper and other paper, whether long-term or  short-term, of questionable credit quality.  And there is this  wonderful notion in the markets that event risk is somehow different from credit risk.  It seems to me that event risk is credit risk that they didn’t anticipate or didn’t price, but they'd rather not admit that to their superiors.  Clearly, the sharpness of the jump in the 30-day spread is a function of the term rolling through the turn of the year.  However, the extent of the spik e can’t be attributed to the calendar nor can the ratcheting up  of the 90-day spread.  On page 5 are the underlying data for the charts on the previous page.  Please don't try to read the fine  print or take out your microscope!  Just view it from a few inches away and look at the shapes of the lines.  On the left side are the 30-day yi elds and on the right side the 90-day yields; the A1/P1 rates are the red lines and the A2/P2 rates the black lines. You can see the year-end for each year, marked by the heavy dashed vertical line. Compare the bottom panel, which depicts the 30- and 90-day yields for this year, w ith those above from the preceding years. While the spike in the 30-day A2 /P2 yield is quite abrupt, what is even more extraordinary about this y ear compared to the previous four years is the relative stability of th e A1/P1 yields, with  the 30-day yield rising only modestly and the 90-day yield actually declining.

34,20010103,"1/3/01 2Now we can turn to the next piece of busin ess, which is the se lection of a Reserve Bank to conduct System open market operations fo r the coming year.  Are there any nominations for that?  Governor Kelley, if you would like to volunteer, that might help move things along. MR. KELLEY.  I was behind the curve on th at one, sorry.  I thought you were going to ask somebody else. MR. FERGUSON.  Why don’t you propose New York for the moment? MR. KELLEY.  All right, I nominate th e Federal Reserve Bank of New York. MR. FERGUSON.  The Federal Reserve Ba nk of New York has been nominated.  Hearing no other nominations or objections, I wi ll also note that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York has been selected as the Bank author ized to conduct System open market operations for the coming year.  And with that, let me turn  the meeting over to Chairman Greenspan.  Thank you. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Thank you very mu ch, Governor.  The purpose of this meeting is to extend our monetary policy disc ussions at our December meeting.  As you may recall, we left the door open for an evaluation of the potential need fo r an intermeeting policy move.  The evidence since that meeting is fairly clear and regrettably somewhat negative, to say the least, in certain respects.  The rate of ec onomic growth continues to  fall, although it’s by no means a breakaway on the down side.  We will be seeing a significant increase in initial claims and insured unemployment when the data are re leased tomorrow morning.  There was an upward revision, I might say, in last week ’s initial claims figures, whic h I was given by the Department of Labor during the week.  And on top of that the early indications are that  there’s going to be a significant increase for the subsequent w eek, the last week in December.1/3/01 3As you probably are all acutely  aware, the S&P earnings per share numbers are being revised down at a fairly aggressive pace week-b y-week, to the point that now the analysts' estimates for both the fourth quarter  and the current first quarter ar e negative versus a year ago.  To be sure, the analysts have revised their numbers upward for the second half of 2001 and 2002, but the problem here is the difficulty of getting a handle on what is clearl y a decelerating path.  And at this stage there is as yet no evidence th at the downward revisions on the part of the analysts have come to an end.  As we’ve all observed, orders are weak ening across the board.  Pockets of high-tech strength pers ist, but generally we’re seeing a very poor orders pattern and deterioration in a number of the industrial sectors of the economy. The Christmas season, as you know, was rather p oor despite the fact that sales in the last two weeks of December did come back some what.  But essentially they were coming back because Christmas retail goods are sold eventually, and the only issue is at wh at price.  What that means in real terms or in profitability is something on which we will not get any good information for at least a number of weeks.   The greatest concern, I think, is the extraord inary weakening that apparently took hold of the motor vehicles industry in December.  Ou r evaluation in the early part of the month, after talking to industry analysts, was that there would be a modest decline seas onally adjusted in auto sales in December relative to November.  But when we got an update later in the month, there was a very significant downward revision, implying that the second ten-day figures were really quite weak.  And the estimate for the third ten days  was such that the projected sales number for December now indicates a dramatic decline.  We will get preliminary data for December tomorrow and final results probably on Friday, but the cutbacks in production schedules we’re all seeing are consistent with a very weak system .  Indeed, in our estimates, we’re reducing the1/3/01 4real GDP growth by 1-1/2 percentage points for th e first quarter, leaving it at 1.7 percent.  Even though that 1.7 percent does imply a degree of stabil ization, it is still a forecast at this point. While consumer confidence in an absolute sense remains historically high, we've all been aware of a very significant erosion in c onfidence.  And much the same pattern has been evident in the NASDAQ, although I mu st say that is less definitely  the case with respect to the Dow Jones Industrial average.  Finally, the data and the anecdotal eviden ce that are coming in from the rest of the world continue poor.  Europe , to be sure, is doing somewhat better than other parts of the world, but the economies of Japan, Ea st Asia, and a number of other foreign nations are looking weaker.  Moreover, what we’re probably going to obser ve anecdotally is that a good deal of that weakness is re flective of what is occurring here in the United States. As I said previously, however, we're certainly  not yet in a free fall.  I say “not yet” because a free fall doesn’t look like a free fall until you really start fa lling.  And there are elements of stabilization in the picture.  Homebuilding, obviously responding to the lower mortgage interest rates, has been doing somewhat  better.  That sector has basically stabilized.  And the most recent data on privat e nonresidential construction th at came out this morning were reasonably good.  Oil prices have come down and the implied ""import tax"" associated with that also has come down.  So, that is removing a very major negative.   Obviously, there are continued drains on the purchasing power of  household incomes as a result of  increases in natural gas and electric power prices.  But there we have largel y an issue of shifts among sectors within the United States; it’s not in the form of an ""im port tax” that the oil price changes created. We are getting some positive evidence in the area of mortgage financing in that the volume of refinancing has gone up quite consider ably in the last week or two.  And our information for this particular period indicates that the ""cash out"" amounts from refinancing are"

Would so mebody like to move the slate? SEVERAL.  So move. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Without obj ection, so ordered.  Our incumbent Manager of the System Open Market Acc ount is a gentleman by the name of Peter Fisher, I believe!  Is there any objection to a ppointing him to a new term?  If not, I will assume that it is so ordered.   The next item on the agenda, which is the discussion of the Federal Reserve portfolio study and the future conduct of System Open Market operations, is going to have to be considered at a joint meeting of  the Board of Governors and the Federal Open Market Committee.  Since it has to be a cl osed Board meeting, I ask for a motion from one of the Board members to close the meeting. MR. FERGUSON.  I move to close the meeting. MR. KELLEY.  Second. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Without obj ection.  Messrs. Kohn and Fisher. MR. KOHN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Peter and I thought it best to begin with a discussion of the basic longer-run approaches to this question of how to reconfi gure the System’s assets as the Treasury debt is paid down.  Then  subsequently and separately we will go on to consideration of specific choices the Committee must1/30-31/01 3make at this meeting concerning the management of the System’s portfolio for the period immediately ahead.  As background for the first round of discussion, I will summarize what I take to be the main issues in the background papers you received, leading to the questions Peter and I posed for the Committee at the end of our cover memo.  After your discussion of these issues, Peter will address short-run strategies.  As you can tell from both the physical and intellectual heft of the studies, these were major undert akings that required considerable work and imagination.  Owing to sp ace constraints we could fit only one of the team leaders from each pa per at the table, but the others are sitting behind me.  Peter and I wa nt to thank the team leaders, as well as all the others from around the Federal Reserve System who were on the teams that prepared these papers, for their considerable contributions.  The team leader s are available to answer your questions after my presentation and before you’ve had a general discussion of the longer-run issues.  I think the first important point  to highlight, evident in the paper you saw last fall from the t eam led by Tom Simpson, is that the issue cannot be put off for much longer.  Under a wide variety of assumptions about the growth of the economy and the political process, Treasury debt will be repaid over coming years.  Even if the entire on-budget surplus is used in tax cuts and new spending, debt will be close to extinguished in 10 years under a fairly conservative assumption of 3-1/2 percent trend economic growth.  Meanwhile, the Treasury market will become increas ingly illiquid, ultimately for RP as well as outright transactions, es pecially consider ing that many of these securities are held by investor s who will be loathe to give them up even at elevated price premiums.  As the debt dwindles, the Syst em will probably want to be gradually reducing its reliance on it.  This course will be necessary to insure that some of our portfolio  is in other more liquid assets and to be helpful to the Treasury in managing the paydown of debt and maintaining liquid market segments as long as possible.  Indeed, if there is a public good aspect to th e existence of a Treasury market, the System would be performing a public service by running its portfolio down faster than the Treasury was repaying debt.  Depending in part on your short-r un decisions, the need to make major changes in the System’s assets does not come immediately, as Peter will be discussing.  But under most probable scenarios it arises soon enough to suggest the necessity of continuing the process of examining longer-run alternatives.1/30-31/01 4 A second point apparent in all th e papers is that there are no easy, obvious solutions to the proble m of what assets to hold under this circumstance.  All options seemed to have significant drawbacks.  Some people have pr oposed continuing to rely on Treasury securities, even as the de bt is paid down, by acquiring them through special arrangements with  the Treasury or the Social Security Trust Fund.  While the System  would be able to continue to hold risk-free government assets, su ch plans themselves do raise a number of questions.  They would transfer the problem of possibly accumulating private assets to anot her part of the government that may not be as well equipped to deal  with it.  They would leave the Federal Reserve with a portfolio of illiquid assets as the Treasury market disappears, and they woul d make the central bank dependent on agreements with the rest of the government for its assets.  Of course, the alternative of taki ng on private obligations raises other issues, including those invol ved with potential effects on private credit allocation and the mana gement of risk and liquidity in the System’s portfolio that were ou tlined in the paper on principles by Chris Cumming and Jack Beebe.  The important point raised in that paper and emphasized in the note from Peter and me was the impossibility of satisfying all the Sy stem's goals at once, and hence the inevitability of making tradeoffs along a number of dimensions of portfolio management.  A key tradeoff would be between minimizing the effects of System portfolio choices on relative asset prices on the one hand, and mi nimizing risk and maximizing liquidity on the other.  A broa dly diversified portfolio, which included credit to financial intermediaries holding nonmarketable assets, would have the greatest chance of exerting as little influence as possible on private credit decisi ons.  With such a portfolio, the System would have a low profile in each market and it would not be favoring one type of asset over anot her.  But the System would be acquiring riskier and less liquid a ssets, and it would be assuming the responsibility to manage those asse ts.  As the paper on open market assets by Sandy Krieger and Brian Madigan makes clear, venturing into new markets and assets will entail a number of management challenges in addition to those involved with credit risk.  These include dealing with new clearing and settlement procedures and with new counterparties.  At the other end of the spectrum, if the Committee chose to concentrate ope rations in a small subset of markets that promised the least cred it risk and the greatest liquidity--for example those for GSE securi ties or A1/P1 commercial paper--it would increase the odds on eventually  affecting relativ e asset prices."
36,20010320,"3/20/01 2MR. KOS.  On the first page the familiar forward rate agreements depict in red the decline of U.S. interest rates over the last few months.  After the Comm ittee’s January meeting, both cash and forward rates were stable at fi rst but began to decrease as the equity market fell under pressure, with announcements of earnings shortfalls in the corporate sector , and as speculation regarding an intermeeting move increased.  That speculation was fueled by the comments of a former Fed official , who in fact started giving precise probabilities of an interm eeting ease.  Currently, with the three-month cash rate--the solid red line--already below 5 percent, the market is anticipating furt her easing beyond any actions that may or may not come from this meeting.  And the chatter about a 75 basis point cut at this meeting ha s coincided with the spillover of weakness from the NASDAQ to the broader stock indices.  As of early this week, most of the pr imary dealers were expecting a 50 basis point easing move at this  meeting, though a minority, 10 out of the 25, were forecasting 75.  Another measure of expectations, the April fed funds futures, is at about 4.84 right now, though it’s difficult to disentangle the degree to  which that reflects expectations of a 75 basis point ease at this meeting or a 50 basis point move today followed by an intermeeting move.    Moving to the euro area--the blue  lines--both cash and forward rates have been largely stable sin ce the beginning of the year.  The European Central Bank (ECB) has b een symmetric in its rhetoric, trying to prevent the market from  anticipating an early ease and taking what it is calling a wait-and- see approach.  But I would note that forward rates began to tr ade below cash rates around early November, or roughly two months after the same dynamic was observed in the United States.  Eu ropean officials have dismissed suggestions that the market is sniffing out a euro-area slowdown and have explained their forw ard market as being pulled by movements in the U.S. market.  Maybe yes, maybe no.  But both forward rates and anecdotal survey s suggest that the market is anticipating 25 basis points of ease from the ECB this spring and a total of 50 basis points by the fall.    In Japan--the set of green lines --we can see that rates basically have made a round trip since last June.  The Bank of Japan (BOJ) initially raised rates in August and then pulled back in the last few weeks with two cuts in the discoun t rate and a cut in the overnight call rate.  Then yesterday the BOJ announced a change in its operating procedures; it indicated th at it will target current account balances on its balance sheet, possibly increasing its acquisitions of Japanese government bonds (JGBs) rather than targeting the call rate per se.  Japanese markets were  closed today, so we’ll have to3/20/01 3wait for reactions tomorrow in th eir markets.  The call rate is expected to trade near zero.   Turning to page two, this set of charts is an updated version of ones introduced last time as a measure of financial conditions, taking the difference between two-y ear rates and the policy rates of some of the major central banks.  The policy rates of the various central banks involve slightly different maturities; some use an overnight target and some use a targ et of as much as two weeks.  The top panel is the two-year government yield less the central bank’s short-term policy rate and the bottom panel is the two-year swap rate less the policy rate.  In the top panel we show the German two-year note versus the ECB’s refinancing rate.  In the bottom panel we used the euro swap ra te versus that same ECB rate.  Whether measured against the two-year note where the inversions occurred first or against the swap rate where the inversions followed a few months later, it seems that financial conditions, if one accepts this as  a good measure of them, were rather tight by early this year.  Now, since the January FOMC meeting, the central banks of Canada, the United Kingdom, and Japan also have eased policy.  Only the ECB did not move.  But the degree of inversion was broadly sim ilar, as was observed at the time of the last Committee meeting.  Turning to page three, I have shown some of the developments in Japanese financial markets ove r the last few months.  The top panel has dollar/yen graphed on an inverted scale,  and you can see that the yen has been depreciating since December and is now in the 122 to 122-1/2 region.  The market generally views the policy in Tokyo as desiring a weaker yen, but Japanese officials have been trying not to appear to be encourag ing that weakening.  But with the Ministry of Finance (MOF) having taken a laissez faire approach, the market is convinced that it is in accordance with their wishes.  Nevertheless, the MOF is trying to walk that fine line, not wanting to antagonize interests on this side of the Pacific.   The middle panel shows the decline of JGB yields.  That has involved an interesting move  from above 1.60 to about 1.15 percent, especially since the fina nce minister was quoted as saying that the fiscal situation in Ja pan was on the verge of being “catastrophic.”  We have seen downgrades of Japanese banks, but at least in the bond market that s eems to have been outweighed by expectations that interest rates w ould fall.  Perhaps the market was anticipating yesterday’s announcemen t by the BOJ.  And regardless of what we may think of it, the JGB market has been the asset of3/20/01 4choice during periods of stress in Japan.  Even at yields of near l percent, the carry, with a near zero  financing cost, is still fairly profitable.  But there’s a sizable ri sk for the banks and the insurers that have loaded up on these bonds, if confidence in this market should falter.  The bottom panel shows the Topix and the Nikkei indices.  They are both down between 15 and 20 percent, perhaps not surprising given what has happened in the economy, which I’m sure Karen will discuss later.  And with  a decline of that magnitude, the topic of bank capital adequacy has come back to the fore, especially with mark-to-market accounti ng soon to be introduced.  But interestingly, the bank sub-index ac tually has performed in line with the broader average.  A widely held presumption is that the government will pump more money into the banks as needed to help with bad debt cleanup.  On page four, the top panel has the euro-dollar exchange rate since the beginning of the year, from the time when this Committee first decreased rates in early Januar y.  The interesting point here is the weakness of the euro, which ha s surprised traders and analysts, given the reduced GDP forecasts for this country, the equity price pressures we’ve seen, and the redu ctions in U.S. interest rates versus steady rates in Europe.    The middle panel shows the degree of interest rate convergence over the period since January 1, which is especially notable at the short end.  The green line shows th e three-month spread in LIBOR between dollar and euro time deposit s, which has moved from about 150 basis points to near 20 basis poi nts.  The blue line is the two-year swap differential, and th at has come down from around 100 basis points to about 40 basis points.  The red line, the 10-year swap spread, has been more stable.  The less pronounced shift in that measure may suggest that the mark et perceives the reduced return on dollar assets to be a short-run phenomenon.  The bottom panel charts the value of the U.S. dollar on a year-to-date basis against a range of cu rrencies.  As you can see, the dollar has appreciated ro ughly 5 percent, give or take, against most currencies.  That appreciation ha s occurred despite some of the negatives that I mentioned before .  And market participants are puzzled about what might explain it.  Among the explanations is that the market may just be gett ing it wrong, that a mis-pricing is going on.  Another is that a V-shaped  recovery is being factored in and that the market is looking beyond the valley.  A less benign interpretation is that the market is pricing in slowdowns in other"
37,20010411,"4/11/01 2 surprising that reports from capital goods producers indicate no signs of stability as yet.March orders appear to have declined for both low- and high-tech producers, possibly owing to overall decreased corporate cash flow.  Foreign markets are also deteriorating, although at a somewhat lesser pace than in the United States.  But growth rates abroad also show no signs as yet of stabilizing. Although the potential power of inventory liquidation turnarounds is such that the odds of the United States economy rebounding over the next several months are still significant, the continued deterioration in profits and the outlook for capital spending indicate that such odds clearly have been falling week by week.  The key test for the period ahead, in my judgment, will be whether the momentum coming from a presumed end to the rise in the rate of inventory liquidation will be adequate to stabilize profit margins and the capital goods markets--and with some stretch, economic conditions in the rest of the world.  If not, the major springboard to recovery will have been dissipated and a more prolonged adjustment process will confront us. I indicated earlier that I would counsel against moving today, for if we do, in my judgment we will break whatever developing pattern for equity price stability may be currently emerging, at least temporarily.  Were we to cut rates, there doubtless would be an initial sharp rise in stock prices as less sophisticated buyers enter the market.However, a move today would remove the constructive ambiguity about monetary policy from the markets.  As a consequence, after the initial price surge the more sophisticated traders could well be selling, with a distinct possibility that stock prices would fall markedly, essentially undercutting the nascent stabilization that may be in the process of forming.  We would have used up some significant monetary policy ammunition without4/11/01 3 realizing any short-term stabilizing benefits.  Long term, of course, it doesn’t matter much unless the failure of achieving short-term stability sets us on a path with long-term consequences.To repeat, we have a credible intermeeting window over the next 10 days.  Let us employ the time to monitor markets, but especially to look for evidence of emerging stability in capital goods orders.  I might say in closing that I know all of you in the Reserve Banks will be working on Beige Book commentary shortly.  And I would request that you make a special endeavor to see if you can gain some insights on what is going on in capital spending within your Districts and what the prospects are for a stabilization and hopefully an upturn.Let me now turn to Sandy Krieger for an update on the markets and then to Dave Wilcox for an update on the staff’s forecast.  And though neither Don Kohn nor Karen Johnson has anything to report initially, they of course will be available for questions, as all of us will be.  Then I hope we can do a roundtable as well.  Sandy. MS. KRIEGER.  Thank you.  As you noted, the markets are moving rather quickly, so some of the point estimates I give you may be dated.  Looking first at forward rates, the spreads between LIBOR and the 3-month forward rate agreements and between LIBOR and the 9-month forward contracts continue to show expectations of Fed easing.The 3-month forward and 9-month forward rates suggest easing of about 35 and 29 basis points, respectively, a little more than at the time of your last meeting but not terribly so, and they indicate a bottom in rates over the next nine to twelve months.  Overall, these rates are about 16 basis points lower than just after your last easing move.4/11/01 4 By comparison, in the euro area--and this does not take into account gyrations currently as a result of the ECB not moving today--the forward markets continue to show more aggressive easing but at a longer lag than in the United States.  And in Japan, as you know, forward rate expectations converge since the rates are so very low. In the Fed funds futures market, we saw some very sharp moves yesterday as a result of the stock market’s gyrations.  The market has been moving away from pricing in expectations of an intermeeting move, and that continued this morning.  The April contract is now very near the current 5 percent funds target.  The May contract is about 25 basis points below that and the June contract is a little under 50 basis points below.So, the market is still looking for a 50 basis point cut by June, but its conviction is shaky right now I would say.  And Eurodollar futures continue to suggest a pattern of declining rates through the fall, but the shape of that curve also suggests that rates will turn up somewhere around the end of the year. Treasury yields have been buffeted as much by the stock market--if not more-- than by economic data.  Again, these yields are continuing to move upward today as they did--sharply--yesterday.  The two-year yield, at around 4.32 percent, is about 11 basis points higher than just after your last move.  But the really significant increases have been further out in the curve.  The 10-year and the long bond are maybe 35 basis points higher than after your last move was digested, and the yield curve has a positive slope across the entire curve.  Equities have bounced off their lows as data such as the Conference Board Index for March have shown some improvement.  Also, there has been an inordinate focus on statements from Fed officials, which have been read to suggest confidence in economic performance later this year.  That was a big driver in the upward"
38,20010418,"4/18/01 2 For those of you who are not watching your  screens, I believe the data on trade accounts came out a couple of minutes ago and in a moment I’d like to throw the ball over to Karen Johnson to give you the very inte resting results.  In short, they show a significant decline in imports.  In  fact, I think it is the sharpest decline we’ve had in many years. In any event, the nature of the gap be tween consumption and receipts is such that the sequence of recovery  out of an economy of the t ype we’re now experiencing--which is usually characteri zed by rising industrial produc tion, stabilized earnings expectations, and hence capital  expenditure stabilization a nd increase--appears somewhat less than robust.  Stock prices, as you know , are significantly higher this morning, but unlike last Wednesday a pattern has already de veloped, for good or ill, and the risks of our breaking it by a move this morning are c onsiderably less than I believe they would have been last week.  Therefore, mainly fo r all the reasons I disc ussed in our telephone conference a week ago, I would propose to go ahead today with a 1/2 percentage point reduction in the funds rate and maintain the language indicating that the balance of risks is weighted toward economic weakness.  But before I open up the floor for discussion and questions, I thought it might  be useful for Karen to talk for a minute or two about these very unusual trade data.   MS. JOHNSON.  The trade deficit for Fe bruary reported this morning rounds to $27 billion, which is about $5- 1/2 billion less than the sligh tly revised January number.  It’s the lowest trade deficit in absolute value since December ’99 and it represents the sharpest drop in imports in the history of th ese particular series calculated the way it is now.  Exports in fact increased very slight ly, but could probably be st be described as4/18/01 3 holding their own.  Thus, the improvement in  the trade deficit owes entirely to the significant drop in imports that has occurred. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Imports of merchandise only, because service imports actually rose. MS. JOHNSON.  Yes, service imports rose.  In the goods categories, the declines occurred in both capital goods and consumer goods.  Imports of industrial supplies also declined, which I would be inc lined to attribute to price effects to a significant degree.  So I would explain, if you will, the goods decline in imports as a reflection of reduced imports of capital  goods--including high-t ech--and of consumer goods across a wide range of categories. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Let me agai n put on the table a proposal to go ahead this morning with a 1/ 2 percentage point reduction in the funds rate and to maintain the balance of risks toward econom ic weakness.  Who would like to comment? VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  I would, Mr. Chairman.  Bill McDonough here.  I very, very much support what you are proposing.  Just a quick comment regarding today’s rise  in the equity markets: I think it is pinned basically on both Intel and Texas Instruments saying that lif e is not quite as grim as they thought it was. The drop in merchandise imports is g ood news for our economy.  However, it’s bad news for the producers of goods around the world.  In my vi ew the international economy more generally is looking weaker.  The news from Japan, mainly with regard to the political paralysis, is ge tting worse.  The latest news out of Europe suggests somewhat lower growth and somewhat higher infl ation.  So if one is looking at the world4/18/01 4 economy, I think it is even weak er than it seemed a week a go.  And I’m very much in favor of your recommendation.  I assume, Mr. Chairman, that the reduction in the funds rate would be accompanied by the Board of G overnors agreeing to a cut in the discount rate? CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Yes, if the Federal Open Market Committee moves forward with the proposed  rate cut, the Board of G overnors will convene to act on the eight requests we have received from Reserve Banks to cut the discount rate by 50 basis points.   MS. MINEHAN.  Mr. Chairman, this is Ca thy Minehan.  I am in favor of your proposal.  Moving in the direc tion you recommend I had no probl em with last week and I continue not to have a problem with that.  I see a slight distincti on between then and now in terms of several pieces of data, including the trade deficit data released this morning, that tend to confirm that one of the streng ths of the economy--one we thought existed, anyway--on the consumer side is eroding now.  I do not take that as a good sign.  And it’s at least one of the reasons why I am in favor of this move. MR. PARRY.  This is Bob Parry.  I have a question.  In light of the trade data, what would be the best estimate now for growth in the first quarter? MR. STOCKTON.  President Parry, this  is Dave Stockton.  Obviously, the devil will be in the details of the trade data , which we have not had an opportunity to examine carefully yet.  But my guess is th at we’d probably be looking at something closer to 1-1/2 percent for GDP growth in the first quarter.  It will all depend on how large an offset we get to these lower imports through lower equipment spending and perhaps somewhat lower inventories for Marc h.  But at this point, some of that"
39,20010515,"5/15/01  2 the 10- and 30-year yields are above the ta rget fed funds rate for the first time since May of 2000.  The chart in the bottom panel depicts the fact that this is not just a Treasury yield curve phenomenon.  Th e U.S. swap curve has steepened substantially as well since last Decemb er, as have the U.K. and Canadian yield curves, although by a lesser amount .  The euro-area swap curve has remained more or less unchanged, alt hough it also has steepened in the last day or two.    Moving to the third page and taking a somewhat longer-term perspective, I have shown the 2- to 30-year spread from January of 1989 through March 11th of this year.  The shaded areas represent periods when the Fed was easing policy.  The sharp steepening of the curv e from about –50 to +150 basis points in the last few months has put the curv e at its steepest since January of 1994.  As the bottom panel shows, despite that  steepening and the backup in yields, the absolute level of 10- a nd 30-year yields is only s lightly above the cyclical low, which was reached in 1998.    The chart at the top of page four s hows domestic credit spreads to U.S. Treasuries of comparable maturities.  The red line is the Merrill Lynch high-yield spread, which is on the left-hand s cale.  The A2 industrial corporates, the U.S. 10-year interest rate swap, and the 10-year Fannie Mae benchmark are on the right-hand scale.  In general, spreads have be en narrowing since January 1st, although high-yield spreads are still wider than they were last summer, perhaps affected by the weak equity ma rket and the higher risk premium that companies with more leveraged ba lance sheets are being charged.  Nevertheless, issuance remained strong in  the first quarter, especially in the investment grade sector.   The bottom panel shows the spread between A1/P1 and A2/P2 paper, which has been drifting lower for both 30- day and 90-day issues.  In part, that may reflect a bit less risk aversion.  But it may also reflect in part the fact that some of the weaker A2 borrowers are having trouble rolling over their commercial paper and have drawn on othe r sources of credit, such as backup credit lines.  Or more likely they have  issued high-yield debt, a vehicle that has remained open for many of these borrowers.  Turning to the next page, I thought I would provide a quick review of the tax season, now that it’s mostly behind us .  In the top panel, the blue bars show the growth of tax receipts for the last three tax seasons--that is, for April and May.  The red bar is the forecast for the current year, which is inclusive of actual data through May 11th and thus actually reflect s most of the period.  The growth this year has been a bit slow er than last year, but it is slightly above what we saw in 1999.5/15/01  3 In the bottom panel, the red line de picts the Treasury’s general balance between April 2nd and May 11th of this year.  The Treasury’s general balance topped out at about $70 billion in ea rly May, but it remained comfortably below TT&L capacity.  Therefore, we we re able to avoid the large reserve drains and the associated buildup in the Treasury’s Fed balance that had become the norm in the last few years.  In fact, we looked back at historical data and found that this was the first tim e in at least 15 years that the general balance did not exceed the TT&L capacity  and therefore spill over onto the Fed.  There were two reasons for this.  One was that the Treasury made more efficient use of cash management bills;  secondly, the Treasury and the St. Louis Fed successfully campaigned with banks to bring additional collateral into the TT&L program and thus raise capacity.    Finally, on the last page I thought I would give the Committee a quick update on our outright operations.  It has been almost a year since we established single-issue limits for SO MA holdings.  And as the top panel shows, we’ve had an increase in our out right operations.  The blue portions of the bars represent net portfolio expans ion.  The gray portions represent the amount that has been purchased to offset the effects of redeemed securities.  As you can see, before 2000 redemptions we re relatively infrequent.  But with the sharp reduction of the size of auctions combined with our single-issue limits, SOMA is having redemptions ba sically every month.  In 2000 and in 2001 to date, as well as in our projection for the rest of the year, more than 50 percent of our outright purchases are to  offset the effects of redemptions.   The bottom panel depicts the number of  outright operations that our Desk has conducted since 1996.  We are now operating on nearly one out of every three business days.  Performance is hol ding up; the bid-to-cover ratio on our operations has stayed at 6 or higher.  But the scale of the Desk’s activity is growing at a time when the size of the ma rket is shrinking, and that is placing somewhat of a burden on our outright operations.  We will be looking in coming weeks at ways we can ease that  pressure on our outright operations, with one of the most likely ways being the expanded use of long-term repos.  For the time being we’re planning to maintain the size of the repo book at $12 billion but we will be examining the scope for expanding that, and I will report back to the Committee after we conclude our analysis.  Mr. Chairman, there were no foreign exchange operations in the intermeeting period.  I will need a vote to ratify domestic operations, and I will be glad to take any questions.  CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Questions for Dino?   MR. PARRY.   Mr. Chairman? CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Yes.5/15/01  4 MR. PARRY.  This is a question for Dino or  for Don Kohn.  As shown on page 2 of Dino’s handout, the yields on 10- year and 30-year Treasury bonds  actually hit a low point at roughly the time of the March FO MC meeting and, of course, have moved up since then.  It’s rather interesting that since that time in Ma rch the Greenbook forecast--and also I think most private forecasts--has become a little more pessi mistic about the economy’s prospects, at least for the shorter term.  Does this mean that the move ment in rates is really due to a reevaluation of longer-run expectations for inflation? MR. KOS.  Especially recently, with the steep ening of the yield curve, there has been chatter in the markets about that as a possibl e explanation.  I don’t know that forecasts of inflation are actually rising.  At least in my reading of the re search and commentary, I haven’t seen that people are raising their expectations for inflation.  But it may be that they’re using that explanation to explain a steepeni ng of the yield curve that they  otherwise can’t quite explain. MR. PARRY.  Well, usually ther e are two reasons.  Your answer implied one, which is that the decline in the funds ra te raises the prospects that th e economy will recover.  And the other is the possibility that inflation could become more of a concern.    CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  There is a third, which may in fact be relevant here.  Since our March meeting, if one listens to the discussions coming out of  Treasury and the White House, the presumption of eliminating the Tr easury debt is becoming less vocal and more attenuated.  Hence, the reduction in yields attributable to a s carcity premium is very clearly changed.  That doesn’t eliminate the possibility of  increased inflation prem iums.  Indeed, we see some of that in the TIPS yields.   MR. PARRY.  Right. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  There may be more  involved in that issue than we know."
40,20010627,"6/26-27/01 2United States, the euro area, Canada , the United Kingdom , and Japan, the degree of inversions has lessened, or in some cases turned slightly positiv e. In the last few weeks, though, som e yield curves have reinverted or seem headed in th at direction. Turning to the next page, the top pa nel depicts the 2-year, 10-year, and 30-year U.S. Treasury yields since Marc h 1st.  Unlike the flat or inverted short end of the curve, th e coupon curve is steep.  The 2- to 30-year spread has widened another 5 basis points si nce the last Comm ittee m eeting to about 166 basis points today. The m iddle panel shows spreads of 10-year A-rated industrial bonds, the 10-year  Fannie Mae benchm ark, and the 10­year swap rate over T reasuries.  The spreads, which had been narrowing all year desp ite the strong p ace of new issues and po or news from the corporate sector, have begun to widen out ever so s lightly in the past couple of weeks.  In the bottom panel, we see the sam e kind of pattern with respect to the Merrill Lynch high-yield index and th e EMBI+ spreads.  Again, m ost of that widening has occurred in the past couple of weeks.   Now, given the large am ount of issuance by the corporate sector, perhaps it’s not surprising that the ma rket is digesting som ewhat and that spreads are backing up a bit. An alte rnative hypothesis s uggests that a bit of risk aversion m ight be setting in, as som e market participants m ay be having second thoughts about the appropria te level of spreads if the tim ing of the recovery is being pushed out. The top panel of the next page ha s the major U.S. equity indic es indexed to April 17th, the day before the FOMC’s interm eeting m ove.  As we can see, equities app reciated sh arply in th e weeks af ter th at move, then went sideways for a while, but actual ly have f allen from their late -May levels by between 5 and 10 per cent, as corporate earnings preannouncem ents have been largely negative. The m iddle panel shows a sim ilar, if more pronounced, pattern to the downside for m ajor foreign indices.  And, in fact, today European m arkets were down another 2 percent on aver age.  Perhaps there, too, we’re witnessing som e signs of risk aver sion over the p ast few weeks, as corporate an d econom ic forecasts were  being revised down.  However, if we saw pronounced risk aversion, then we m ight also expect to see an uptick in implied volatilities on equity  indices.  But as the bottom  panel shows, the implied volatility on the S& P 100 futures, also known as the VIX Index, has actually been trending  lower and the abso lute level is toward the lower end of its observed historical range.   Turning to the next page, let m e say a word on th e euro-do llar exchange rate. The top panel depicts th at rate since the launch of the euro in January of 1999. The middle panel ch arts the differentials between the6/26-27/01 3U.S. and euro rates for 3-month depos its, the 2-year swap, and the 10-year swap. We observe the sharp narrowing dur ing that time in the euro’s favor.  But I would note that the 10-year swap spread stopped narrowing in January, just as the latest  bout of euro weakness rea sserted itself, and that spread still favors the dollar by about 60 basis points. The bottom  panel has 1- and 12-m onth implied volatilities of the euro-dollar exchange rate for that sam e period.  I would m ake two points.  First, volatilities have drifted higher for a lmost the whole two-year period after the euro ’s launch, as the euro depreciat ed and as most traders and analysts were certain that the euro would and should rise.  Second, volatilities have actually been falling during this m ost recent period of euro weakness.  The bearish view  accounting for this change in  behavior is that the m arket is no longer fighting euro weakness and has becom e comfortable with the euro trading in th e mid- to high 80s.  The bullish v iew is that p erhaps positio ns that needed to be insured by options have been reduced. Now, if the weaker long s are out and  hence the o verhang of long euro po sition s has been flushed out of the market, then ironically that m ay suggest that the euro m ight finally begin to  rise.  Time will tell. Turning to the last page and a word about reserves, the top panel graphs our f orecast for currency g rowth for the rest of 2001.  As of the May FOMC m eeting, we were still forecasti ng 5 percent currency growth for the remainder of 2001, consistent with the relatively slow growth we saw in 2000. Since that m eeting we have adju sted expected curre ncy growth to 7 percen t to reflect the fas ter growth ob served in the  most recen t months and also our an ticipation that curren cy grow th may revert toward the pace th at we had seen before last year. The bottom  panel shows the im plications of this change for our operations. This chart is an updated version of one you saw at the last meeting, outlining the ex pected net g rowth of SOMA, shown by the blue bars, and our total purchases  of securities required to offset redem ptions--if the entire need were m et by outrigh t purchases--shown by the gray bars.  We at the Desk expect to rely m ostly on outright purchases to m eet these reserv e need s, but I am  a little relu ctant to rely solely on outright purchases given our a lready hef ty presenc e in th e market.  To som e degree we will benefit, though very slightly, from the Treasury’s introduction of a four-week Treasury bill, which is expected in  mid-July or August.  We plan to participa te in the auc tions for those bills and we will a lso loo k to expand modestly the long-term  repo book, which has been at $12 billion recently.   Let m e mention two other item s if I m ay, Mr. Chairm an.  Two m emos were circulated to the Comm ittee last week. The first is a note regarding a technical adjustm ent to our collateral pool as it rela tes to Sallie Mae debt.  The second m emo, from Don Kohn and myself, provided an update on the6/26-27/01 4 work that’s being done on the SOMA a ssets study and I’d like to m ake two points about that second m emo.  First, there is a group of people researching the possibility of adding Ginnie Mae debt to the list of  assets that we buy, and we hope to provide an  update on that issue at the August meeting of  this Comm ittee.  There w as also a typ o in the cov er note that I wanted to correct. Second, with re spect to m unicipal debt and foreign sovereign debt, as the m emo indicates, we have looked at both possibilities.  The m unicipal debt does not seem  to show prom ise for our operational needs, while the foreign sovereign debt  has som e potential.  We would like to explo re the latter po ssibility f urther, but at the sam e time--with the Comm ittee’s concurrence--cease furt her work on municipal debt.   Mr. Chairm an, ther e were no f oreign operations  in this p eriod.  I will need a vote to ratify our dom estic op erations.  And I’d be happy to answer any questions. CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  Questions for Dino? MR. JORDAN. Does your currency  forecast m ake any explicit assum ption about currency dem and as we head toward the end of the year and the laun ch of the euro as  the currency in Europe? MR. KOS. Not explicitly. Some noise m ay be created so it m ay have some effect.  But we think it’s likely to be very sm all, or at least th at’s the assum ption em bedded in the forecast. MR. JORDAN. Well, there has been som e anecdotal speculation that the countries that are outside the euro area--where very large amounts of deutsche marks are held and no provisions have been m ade for conversion--m ay find alternatives in either Federal Reserve notes or travelers checks or som ething, at  least tem porarily.  I’ve been told  that the price of jewelry, of diam onds and so forth, is really skyrocketing in Europe.  But the word is that large am ounts of Federal Reserve notes also are being used again."
41,20010821,"8/21/01 2 out to 3 years, but the longer end of  the curve has proved more resistant to further prodding by the Bank of Japan. The announcement by the Bank of Japan on August 14th that it would increase its current account balance target from 5 trillion to 6 tr illion and also raise the pace of JGB purchases has not noticeably affected the yield curve. In fact, the longer end of the curve is actua lly higher than it was on June 26th.       Turning to page 2, I’ve provide d a snapshot of asset prices in U.S. markets.  All three markets--the fixed income, equity, and foreign exchange markets--reflect a con tinually shifting sentiment and are discounting a weaker outlook. The to p panel shows the 2-, 10-, and 30-year yields along with the fe d funds target since April 1st. The entire curve has shifted lower and the 2- to 30-year spread has steepened by another 10 basis points, from about 166 basis points at the time of the last meeting to about 176 basis points at the close yesterday.         I would make two points.  First, benchmark long-term rates have come down quite a bit in the last seven weeks.  The 10-year is down about 40 basis points and the 30-year  is down somewhat less, by about 20 basis points. Second, the 2-year note traded as low as 3.64 percent during this period, the lowest rate since the 2-year note began to be regularly auctioned in 1976. By  way of comparison, during 1992 and 1993, when the funds rate was at 3 percent for an extended period of time, the 2-year rate never fell below 3.66 percent.  Given the sensitivity of the 2-year note to th e funds rate, if the markets were building toward a tightening at some point--as suggested by the Eurodollar futures and the forward rate agreements--then one might have expected the 2-year note yield to be higher th an it is now.  So, its behavior at least raises questions about the signals being given by some of those other indicators.       In the middle panel I’ve plotted the major U.S. stock indices indexed to 100 on April 1st, which also coincides roughly with their lows for 2001. As reflected in the chart, those indi ces rose through much of the spring but have been coming down--and have continued to come down in the intermeeting peri od--as the market has adjusted to the weaker outlook.       The bottom panel shows change s in the trade-weighted value of the dollar against other major currencies.  The dollar has declined modestly on a trade-weighted basis, but that masks sharper declines against some of the major currencies, especially the yen, the euro, the Swiss franc, and even some other currencies such as the Singapore dollar that have been used as funding currencies in so -called carry trades.  In part the decline is probably due to perceptions  about the recovery ; in part it may reflect some risk aversion.  As ec onomic activity seems to be slowing8/21/01 3globally, a little risk aversion m ay lead  to a closing out of some carry trades. And finally, som e of the ongoing chatter in m arkets about the Adm inistration’s posture toward the dollar m ay also be a contributing factor.       Turning to the third page, th e top panel depicts the m ajor European equity indices, also going back to early April.  They show a sim ilar patte rn to th at in U.S. markets excep t that the de cline h as been m ore dram atic for European equities, espe cially over the interm eeting period.  In that interval m ost of these m ajor indices fell between 3-1/2 and 10 percen t, in p art reflectin g revis ions in forecasts f or growth as  well as weak earnings. Interestingly, though, the euro actually had one of its sharpest rallies since its launch, m oving from  about 85 cents to alm ost 92 cents during this period for reasons that are not fully clear, given some of the news that w as com ing out of Europe.  One explanation might be that interest rate differentia ls are finally biting.  Those interest rates have been narrowing for alm ost two years in favor of the euro.  The bottom  panel shows the differentia ls between dollar and euro swap rates. These spreads con tinue to decline m odestly but are s till sligh tly in favor of the dollar.       Turning to the next page , the top panel depicts the dollar-yen exchange rate. A couple of notewor thy events have taken place in Japan since the last FOMC m eeting. First, the Upper House elections were held and the LDP and Prim e Minister Koizum i did quite well--an outcom e that is exp ected  to accelerate structural refor ms in Japan.  Second, on August 14th the BOJ announced changes in its operational targets, as I noted earlier. That combination would have been expected to produce a weakening in the yen and a lift to the  equity m arkets.  In the event, the yen actually has appr eciated from  about 125 to below 120 this m orning and equity prices have continued their dec line, as ref lected in the m iddle panel.  The reasons for the yen’s appreciation are not fully obvious. Repatriation and the a pproach of the end of the fiscal half-year have been m entioned yet ag ain.  Another possibility is that there m ay be som e risk aversion kicking in that is causing som e of the short yen trades to be unwound. But it’s not im mediately apparent why the yen would be appreciating in  this kind of environm ent. As I m entioned, Japanese equities  have continued to decline with only a brief interruption after the Up per House elections and the BOJ’s operational changes. The Nikkei, wh ich was over 13,000 at the tim e of the last FOMC m eeting is now be low 12,000 and at its lowest level since 1984. The Topix Bank sub-ind ex has also been falling again, reflecting renewed doubts about the health of the Japanese banking system .  As the bottom  panel shows, that sub-index is actually lower now than it was during the 1998 banking crisis in Japan.8/21/01 4      Turning to the last page, the chart shows monthly growth rates, seasonally adjusted, for currency during 2001. As you can see, we’ve had elevated currency growth in July and also in August.  Most of that is attributed to cash sh ipments overseas, primarily to Argentina.  The growth of currency has been r unning at roughly double the rates observed earlier this year, translati ng into deepening reserve needs over the past intermeeting period.  Those deeper needs were met primarily by an expansion of the permanent SOMA portfolio and by a modest increase in the amount of long-term RPs outstanding.         Mr. Chairman, there were no foreign exchange operations during the intermeeting period, but I will ne ed a vote to ratify the domestic operations. And I will be happy to take any questions. CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  Questions for Dino?  If not--VICE CHAIRMAN MC DONOUGH.  Move approval of domestic operations. MR. PARRY. Second. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Without objectio n, they are approved.  Now we’ll go on to David Wilcox and Vince Reinhart.  David. MR. WILCOX.  Thank you, Mr. Chai rman.  A reader of this meeting’s Greenbook could be forgiven, I think, for contracting at least a mild case of sticker shock.  After all, we revised down our estimate of growth for the current year--alrea dy half completed--by 0.4 percentage point, and for next year by twice th at much, to cut 1-1/4 percentage points from the level of GDP by the end of next year.  But rather than casting this forecast as a big change from its predecessor, I would like to begin today by making the case that this can largely be seen as a status quo forecast.       Without a doubt, there has been  considerable buzz in the last few weeks about the revisions to th e national income accounts and how dramatically those revisions have changed perceptions of macroeconomic reality.  In a way, of  course, that is correct.  The revised figures suggest that firms invested much less than previously estimated during the past three year s.  Accordingly, capital deepening occurred at a slower pace, and th at has important implications, of course, for growth prospects. As my colleagues Fleischman, Sichel, and Struckmeyer outlined in their memo to you last week, we have trimmed our estimate of potential GDP growth by four tenths this year and six tenths next year .  Obviously, a revision of  this magnitude is of enormous consequence for some issues, including assessments of the"
42,20010913,"9/13/01 2 the early days of September pr ior to the cr isis, we were st ill in that very precarious balance with regard to which way the econom y was going to go.   The shock event of this past week is clea rly a negative one.  It is negative in the m ost important sense that it presum ably increases the real risk prem ium for long-term capital investm ent, for fa irly obvious reasons .  That is, the longer-term  environm ent for which capital investm ent decisions currently ar e being m ade must be perceived to be less certain and potentially of considerably m ore concern than one would have felt earlier.  How significant that deteriorat ion is I think is exceptionally  difficult to judge.  Indeed, one can envision a scenario--it’s a low probabi lity scenario b ut scarcely zero--that this tragic even t could create a fairly p ronounced a nd signif icant shift in the p olitica l struc ture in the world and that as a consequence, the areas that in the la st several decades have been of longer-term  concern, m ainly those relati ng to the av ailability of crude oil, cou ld conceivably change. The widesp read shock effect and som e of the im plications of  the current politics could get a lot of people tu rned around, including thos e in moderate Arab states. Indeed, I just received a fax about half an hour ago expre ssing condolences to the American p eople from  the head of the central  bank of the United Arab E mirates.  Clearly, that is a m oderate Saudi-type regim e, but there is the possibility that at the end of the day some positive ef fects cou ld com e from all of  this.   I want to e mphasize, h owever, tha t that is a low probability outcom e, and I think we  have to be c areful not to  get tak en in by the way in which the r eaction s to th ese types of  events usually evolve.  There is a shock; the shock w ears off; there is a period of m ild euphoria as the shock wears off; and then there’s a secondary negative effect. With this extraordinary outpouring of activity9/13/01 3 favorable to the United S tates position, we m ay well be looking at part of the euphoria phase. I was listening to the official English language G erman broadcast service late last night--D eutsche W elle, for those of you who turn on the short wave radio and like to listen to these types of broa dcasts--and I m ust say that the Germ an support for us was really quite rem arkable.  The support was not only at the political level.  In fact Mr. Fischer, the head of the Green Party, which is a trem endously pacifi st and scarcely a pro-United States organization, was very supportive of the United States, as indeed was the Germ an governm ent.  But m ore importantly there was apparently a lot of  activity am ong the rank and file voters--and presum ably non-vot ers--with candlelight parades in support of the United States and in opposit ion to this act of barbarism against civilized society.   So there are the m akings of an elem ent of euphoria that could arise.  But it doesn’t strike m e as somethi ng that we ought to take all th at seriously because after a surge of that type of sentim ent, it usually star ts to dissipate graduall y.  Then the political wrangling that norm ally goes on in a dem ocratic  society is likely to reem erge, which is the reason why W inston Churchill made his very fa mous re mark about democracy.  Furtherm ore, the net effect from  this tragic  event, any way one can cut it, has to be negative. Whether it’s sufficiently negative to create a significant downside potential for the econom y, we don’t know.  While the econom y in our country seem ed to be stabilizing, though precariously so, Japan’s has been  deteriorating.  There is ve ry little positive news com ing out of Japan. There had been som e mode st indications that Europe was perhaps stabilizing, at least in part, prior to the event.  But, as  you know, we’ve seen problem s inArgentina, Brazil, and East Asia. So, the re st of the world has not been a particularly happy place.  This event came at a most inopportune time if one really wants to look at it purely from an economic forecaster’s point of view. I think it’s much too soon to make judgments about how this will ultimately come out, but that it is a si gnificant negative has to be th e case.  Indeed, Dave Wilcox was indicating to me a few minutes ago that  the staff was getting evidence about the infrastructure breakdowns that are in th e process of occurring.  Remember, the government has shut down American airspace, and a considerable amount of just-in-time inventory is moved by airfrei ght.  The downside of our high- tech just-in-time inventory system is that it is clearly vulnerable to disr uption.  It’s rare that we get disruptions of sufficient magnitude to have an impact, but there is that possi bility here.  I gather that announced shutdowns--MR. W ILCOX.  I don’t think they ’ve announced further shutdowns. CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  I saw that in the newspaper. MR. WILCOX.  They shut down their plants on Tuesday and Wednesday.  There were additional curtailments of produc tion after that and t hose are expected to persist perhaps until Monday.  I don’t know the extent to which those further shutdowns have been made public. The initial closings we re related simply to the shock of the event itself. Their persistence I think  inability to supply its plants sufficiently with parts and so forth. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Thank you. Don, could you give us a quick rundown on how you see the events of this week in term s of the im pact they are having on the financial system ?   9/13/01 4"
43,20010917,"9/17/01 2 We must continue to su pply liqu idity generously over the d ays ahead u ntil the markets return to m ore norm al functioning.  As a consequence, the federal funds rate could well trade below our target from tim e to time.  I think we need to recognize that possibility publicly in  our press announcem ent so that m arket participants  don’t expect us to com e in and drain reserves while the financia l system  is still sor ting out its problem s.   Who would like to disc uss this issue? VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH .  Mr. Chairm an, this is Bill McDon ough.  May I in tervene? CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  By al l means. VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH .  I believe that your recomm endation is absolutely the right thing to do. It is the ri ght thing to do for our ec onomy.  It is the right thing f or the Federal Res erve to show  the f lag at this awesome, awful m oment in our country’s history. The tim ing of the action be fore the m ajor m arkets of the United States open this m orning I thin k is absolu tely idea l.  Fifty basis po ints is the r ight amount; 25 basis poin ts would be to o little and more than  50 is unneces sary.  And I fully agree with your view that our statem ent should indicate that the balance of risks rem ains weighted toward econom ic weakness and that the a nnouncem ent should include m ention of the possibility that the federal funds rate could well trade below our target at tim es.  That would tell market participants that they  need not be concerned about technical, mechanical, reserve-draining act ions if the funds rate shou ld trade on the soft side.  Thank you.

Whe n we had an initial discussion of the s ituation last week, I must say that I began to consider the possibi lity of this action.  As I thought about it over the weekend, I cam e to believe that it is the right thing to do.  Should it be necessary to reve rse o ur action in a m onth or two, we will take th e app ropria te steps at th at point in time.  But right now I do think som e measurab le--and 50 basis points is measurable given where the funds rate has been recently--s upport for the m arket along the lines that you recomm end is the right thing to do.  I just hope that this m ove, co mbined with everybody else’s action s this m orning, will help  to keep a floor on thing s.  So I’m  fully in favor of this action. MR. PARRY.

44,20011002,"10/2/01 2 ticked up a bit and the Japanese governm ent bond (JGB) yield curve was little changed after the announcem ent, suggesting to some that the BOJ’s tweaks in the past few months had ceased to have an impact on rates beyond the very short end of the coupon curve. The top panel on page 2 graphs th e 2-year, 10-year, and 30-year Treasury yields along with the target  fed funds rate since August 1st. Two-year rates declined, beneficiar ies of policy easing, a weak equity market, and general risk aversion.  The curve steepened to 255 basis points from  about 165 basis points at  the tim e of the last m eeting.  The 10-year yield declined 32 basi s points, while the 30-year fell a more m odest 6 basis points.  Some market participants explained the restrained move in 30-year yields as reflecting n ascent inf lationary risks, while others attributed the p rice action to the canceled Septem ber buybacks and the generally  revised fiscal stance that would lead to far higher Treasury su pplies than h ad been anticipated previously. The steepening trend observed in the U. S. Treasury yield curve has also been seen in yields abroa d, as reflected in the m iddle panel.  The 2- to 10-year Bund spread m oved alm ost in lockstep with move ments in our curve.  And even the Japanese 2- to 10-year spread steepened ever so slightly, prim arily due to a shift in the 10-year JGB yield. In the bottom panel we observe th at in som e segm ents of the bond m arkets the reaction has varied.  Spreads in the investm ent grade sector--not seen here--have la rgely been s table.  And in the cas e of agencies and swaps, the spreads have actu ally declin ed slig htly.  But spreads on riskier paper have widened.  The EMBI+ spread and the Merrill Lynch high-yield sp read both widened after the 11th. These high-yield spreads hit le vels last seen on January 2nd, the day before the F OMC’s first easing m ove in the cycle.  Trading turnover in em erging m arkets and on high-yield paper decreased after the attacks. And liquidity conditions  deteriorated and have not yet recovered to norm al levels.   The three graphs on the next page  depict the perc entage ch ange in var ious e quity ind ices for the th ird quarter.  The U.S. indices are shown in the top panel, m ajor forei gn indices in the m iddle panel, and a representative sam ple of e merging m arket equity indices in the bottom  panel.  Most indices dec lined between 15 and 30 percent and nearly all had fallen substantially even before Septem ber 11th, adjusting to downwardly revised grow th and profit forecasts.  Stocks of less estab lished com panies fared worse than more season ed companies.  In the United States the percen tage d eclin e in th e10/2/01 3 NASDAQ was alm ost double the f all of the Dow and the S&P.  Internationally, em erging m arkets indices on balance fell som ewhat more than markets in m ore developed countries. Turning to page 4 and the m ajor currencies in foreign exchan ge markets, the  dolla r actu ally was lit tle changed as m easured by m ost trade-weighted indices, but showed considerab le varia tion in bila teral rates. In general, risk aversion wa s reflected in the appreciation of the Swiss franc and the yen, in part b ecause of perceptions about their value as safe havens, and probabl y more im portantly as yen- and Swiss franc-funded carry trades were unwound.  On the other hand, currencies of countries with large comm odity sectors, such as the Australian dollar, the Canadian dol lar, and the N ew Zealand dollar, deprec iated to near their all-tim e lows, as did th e curren cies of countries such as Brazil, which have large external financing requirem ents.  While the downgrade in U.S. growth has probably reduced exp ected risk -adjuste d returns on dollar assets, the contem poraneous downgrade of overseas prospects m ay have offset those adverse effects on the dollar. Turning to the m iddle panel, the yen had been appreciating against the dollar since ea rly August.  With the retrenchm ent of risk appetites, yen-funded carry tr ades were unwound and Japanese investors were reportedly repatria ting funds before their quarter-end.  With the sustained upward pressure on the yen, the Japanese monetary au thoritie s intervened on S eptem ber 17th and continued to intervene in large am ounts through th is past F riday, the end of the Japanese fiscal half-year. In all,  the Japanese m onetary autho rities purchased $ 26.7 billion and 600 m illion euros, w hich the EC B acquired as agent of behalf of the Bank of Japan.  The aggregate dollar purch ases included $200 m illion which th e Desk acqu ired as agent for the Japanese on Septem ber 27th. Within the f oreign exchange market, a m ajor topic of discussion among traders is whether the Ministry of Finance’ s intervention w as intended as a bridge to get Japanese financial in stitutions through the fiscal half-year-end on Septem ber 30th or wheth er the inte rvention will p ersist.  If the latter, that would be taken as a signal of a renewed attempt to jump-start the export sector. As the botto m panel sho ws, all of  the euro’s rec ent depre ciation occurred in early August. Since m id-August, the euro has traded in a narrow range. The currency is perceived as neither a safe haven nor an asset associated with an ec onom ic area that has higher grow th prospects th an the United States.  Therefore, ass et returns are expected to be no better and no wors e than what will be av ailable in the United S tates.Turning to the next page, the terrorist attacks trig gered an increase in both observed and im plied volatility in m ost markets, and these graphs show the volatility of  a sample of major ass et price relationships. The top panel de picts implied volatility on one-month euro-dollar and dollar-y en options.  Both rose sharply on the 11th and hit highs of about 14-1/ 2 percent on Septem ber 17th, the day that the Comm ittee and other central banks eased policy, but declined in subsequent days. These volatility levels, though sharply higher than the volatility levels of 10 percent or  so in early July, are m odest by historical standards. In 1998 th e volatility of dol lar-yen options reached a high of nearly 28 percen t. The m iddle panel graphs  the im plied volatility of the Decem ber Eurodollar contract and the bottom  panel graphs the volatility of the S&P 100, also known as the VIX. Both volatility levels roughly doubled from their levels in late Aug ust and both  reached h ighs that exceeded slightly th e hig hs observed during th e 1998 crisis.  In the case of the Decem ber Eurodollar contract, the implied volatility exceeded th e 1998 high by quite a b it.  While the VIX index has declined som ewhat from its recent  highs, its im plied volatility and that of the E urodollar contract both remained at elevated levels.   Turning to the next page, the top panel depicts total Federal Reserve balances day by day since the last FOMC m eeting.  With the disruptions caused by the attacks,  the com bination of discount window loans, open m arket operations, plus autonom ous factors sharply increased balances to as  high as $121 billion on September 13th. Despite the apparent flushness of markets, even allowing for higher dem and for excess reserves, this was deceiving.   The inset in the top panel shows balances, both borrowed and nonborrowed, for the entire banking sy stem  for the five days starting on Septem ber 11th. The green bar in the inset shows the end-of-day balances , which was having problem s with its clearing and settlem ent system .  On Septem ber 12th, the en tire banking system  held about $63 billion of reserves before borrowing.  before discount window borrowing and overdraft s.  Distribution of  reserves continued to  be a problem until the afternoon of the 14th when  began to m ake pr ogress in clearing its backlog of transa ctions.   By early th e following week, we began to work down balances as they started to be  distributed m ore efficiently. 10/2/01 4"
45,20011106,"11/6/01 2 Staying with the Japanese markets for a bit on page two, the top panel shows the 5-year Japanese government bond (JGB) yield and the 5-year yen swap rate since January 2000. The middl e panel depicts the 10-year JGB and swap rates for the same period.  In bot h, the spread between the swap rate and the JGB yield trended near 25 basis points  in early 2000, then began to narrow in late 2000 and early 2001 as yields starte d to fall and rates at the short end approached zero. By the summer, the 10-ye ar differential went to zero and was even negative on some days.  The 5-year differential narrowed a bit later and is now also near zero. So bank obligations in a country with known banking problems are being priced as substitutes for government credit.  One interpretation would suggest that the market is alrea dy presuming that Japanese bank risk is sovereign ris k.  Another explanation can be found by looking at the flows that are creating this  relationship.  Japanese banks have been very large buyers of 5- and 10-year swaps. That is, they are receiving a long-term fixed rate and paying a short-term floating rate, which lately has been near zero.  That is functionally similar to buying a JGB a nd financing it in the short-term repo market.  The sellers of these swaps repor tedly have been foreign commercial and investment banks.  Japanese banks have added to their swap positions rather than purchasing more JGBs because of a preferential accounting treatment. With small probabilities that shor t rates will move higher any time soon, the situation probably does not pose near-term concerns.  But Japanese banks do have a stake in spreads staying tig ht and, given that the banks are also large holders of JGBs, in rates remaining low.  Ergo, one quickly gets into the circular logic of the situation. The po ssible need to clean up bank balance sheets may force the government to issue more bonds  to finance that endeavor, which in turn will raise yields and inflict losses on banks holding large JGB positions and large swap positions as well. As for the markets’ views on the st ate of Japanese banks, the bottom panel graphs the Tokyo stock exchange co mposite index and the bank sub-index.  Both are down substantially since Janua ry of 2000.  Interestingly, the bank sub-index has had its greatest underperformance in the last 12 months, precisely during the time that swap spreads began to narrow. As we go through the next three pag es of charts, I will b riefly review a number of asset pr ice relationsh ips in  major m arkets in the e ight weeks sin ce Septem ber 11th. The top panel of page three i ndexes the dollar’s exch ange rate against the euro, the yen, and the Swiss franc since August 1st.  Despite the  weak data on the U.S. economy, the dollar is ba ck to levels where it traded in m id-August, having recovered from  the post- Septem ber 11 losses  against both the yen and the euro. It is s till som ewhat lo wer ag ainst the Swis s franc.  The middle panel graphs im plied volatilities, which have continued to com e down to around 10 percent, com pared to 12 percent in mid-August and 14 percent in m id-Septem ber.11/6/01 3 Another vantage point into the s eeming tranquility of the foreign exchange market is through risk reversals.  This is an options  trade that reflects whether market participants are willing to pay an added premium for protection against the risk of a rising dollar, in which case dollar calls are expensive relative to dollar puts. Alternatively, in the case of  trying to protect against the risk of a falling dollar, dollar puts are favored. Imm ediately after September11th the marketplace bid up dollar puts, but since then this indicator--quite unus ually--has moved to absolute neutrality for all three major currency pairs.  The optim istic view is that market participants believe that exchange rates have achieved something of a sustainable equilibrium.  Probably the more plausible explanation is that there is a lack of conviction among traders about the likely course of exchange rates.  That hypothesis is also supported by anecdotal  evidence in that there has been a pulling back of risk-taking in the foreign exchange market. On page four, the top panel depi cts a num ber of the m ajor global equity indices since August 1st, but re-indexed to th eir closing levels on Septem ber 10th. In general, the m ajor indices ha ve m oved in a correlated fashion back to pre-attack levels. The middle panel graphs selected major emerging market indices.  With the exception of the Argentine Merv al index, most have recovered but not as much as the indices of developed c ountry markets.  There appears to have been more discrimination among emerging markets and between emerging and developed markets.  Unlike the calm prevai ling in the forei gn exchange markets and despite the recovery of stock prices, implied volatility--at least as measured by the VIX in the bottom panel--has gone sideways at between 30 and 35 percent since the last meeting, but it is still somewhat elevat ed relative to historical patterns. As shown on page five, spread rela tionships in fixed-income markets tell a similar story.  Spreads continued to  widen on higher risk assets, such as debt of emerging markets, as seen in th e top panel.  The high-yield spread has stayed relatively flat since the last mee ting, but it has also remained at elevated levels despite the rally in equity market s.  In contrast, spreads have actually narrowed for better quality obligations , such as agencies and swaps.  Interestingly, the rising ti de did not lift all boats in the investment-grade corporate sector. The spread in A2 cor porate issues widened slightly.  But even there, one needs to consider that absolute  yields for A2 paper declined modestly.  Moreover, the market absorbed a massi ve amount of supply, including that coming from several issuers who were refinancing maturing commercial paper and willing to pay the premium spread in order to get the deals done.  Finally, at the short end, the implied volatility on near-term Eurodollar contracts has again been rising recently, pointing to some lingering uncertainty at the short end.11/6/01 4 Turning back to the government yield curve, the top panel of page six depicts the benchmark on-the-run issues in  yield terms along w ith the target fed funds rate since August 1st. Until the middle of last week the pattern of recent months persisted, with gradually falling yields--especially at the short end--and thereby a steepening of the yield curve.   The Treasury’s refunding announcement last Wednesday, which included plans to  revise the buyback program and to suspend issuance of the 30-year bond, surprised the market in its timing and for that matter also surprised the Treasury in the extent of the market reaction. Yields fell sharply on Wednesday and Thur sday as traders rushed to close out short positions in their tr ades, whereby they had been long the 2-year note or similar duration paper and short the 30-y ear bond.  By this morning the long bond yield was at 4.86 percent or almost 40 basis points lower than the closing yield on the day before th e Treasury’s announcement. The bottom  panel depicts yield curv es for A2 industrial corporate bonds, Fannie Maes, swaps, and Treasuries as of Septem ber 10th and as of Nove mber 2nd. In general, the pattern observe d in the Treasury yield curve has spilled over to the o ther curves  as well.  Since Septem ber 10th, inte rest rates are generally lower and yield curves are steeper. Moving to the commercial paper market, the theme there is that the year-end has come early to that market. The top left panel graphs the spread between 30-day A1/P1-rated paper and A2/P2 around year-end for three recent years. The 1997-98 period, in blue, wa s typical of many years until very recently.  The black line depicts last yea r’s sharply widening spread and the red line represents the current spread.  The top right panel shows the same  set of relationships for 90-day paper. The trends are similar, though la st year’s widening began later and the size of the widening probably was infl uenced by the suddenness with which the California utilities had difficulty rolli ng over their commercial paper.  This year’s widening began soon after the events of September 11th. The downgrading of several co rporations has reportedly made some managers unwilling to hold A2/P2 paper at yea r-end for window-dressing reasons, but many other fund managers have become unwilling to hold any A2/P2 paper under any circumstances.  The wider spreads have been necessary to draw in new buyers, such as European institutions, to pick up the slack.  Still, the A2/P2 sector has contracted by nearly 50 per cent this year in terms of the amount outstanding. The bottom panel shows the spread  of 90-day A1/P1 commercial paper to 3-month Treasury bills on the left and A2/P2 paper relative to 3-month Treasury bills on the right. These two gr aphs indicate that the widening of the A2/P2 spread, at least so far, is strict ly a matter of deterioration in the A2/P2 sector. Of note is how well the A1/P1 sect or is holding up, with issuers able to sell paper at a cost of only 10 basis po ints or so more than Treasuries."
46,20011211,"12/11/01 2 In the euro area the ECB reduced policy rates by 50 basis points on November 8th, two days after the FOMC action, and cash rates--shown in the solid green line--have been stable since then.  Forward rates fluctuated mostly in response to U.S. data. On balance, the market expects that short-term rates probably will decline by another 25 to 50 ba sis points over the next few months.   As you can see in the bottom  panel, in terest rates in Japan remain very low. The discussion in Japanese financia l circles is about what further steps the Bank of Japan (BOJ) can take to make policy even more accommodative.  So one might ask why forward rates are beginning to drift higher.  The answer is not fully clear. Certainly, there is no  expectation that the BOJ will abandon its zero interest rate policy any time soon.  One possibility--and I stress it’s only a possibility--is that forward rate agreem ents, which are obligations of banks, are beginning to reflect a credit risk premiu m that is not showing up, at least not yet, in other money market instruments.   Turning to page 2, the charts on the top half of the page depict the volatility of Treasury yields over the past 45 days.  The top left panel graphs the 2-year yield along with the ta rget fed funds rate.  The top right panel graphs the 10- and 30-year yields. In general, these yields move d in very much the same pattern as the 9-month forward rate I mentioned earlier.  They rose in early November because of optimism about the economy, retraced that rise as the optimism cooled, and then spiked higher despite data on some days, such as Friday’s weak labor market report, that would typically be associated with lower, not higher, interest rates. On bala nce, 2-year yields ha ve risen a bit more than 1/2 percentage poin t over the intermeeting peri od and the spread between the 2-year note and the fed funds rate has risen to 100 basis points, the largest this year. Yields on 10-year and 30-year  Treasuries rose about 75 basis points. The complaints from market participan ts about volatility can be supported by the data in the bottom chart on page 2.  The red line is the volatility of daily yield changes in the 2-year note, measured  in basis points on the left scale, since February 1988. Fluctuations have been smoothed by using a 60-day moving average. In general, during most of th at period this measure of volatility moved in a range of 3 to 6 basis points and usually between 3 and 5 basis points.  Recently, the volatility of the 2-year not e was as high as 7 basis points; that level had been approached briefly a c ouple of times in the mid-1990s and was exceeded only in the late 1980s.  The chart also graphs the target fed funds rate over the same period. The relationship betw een the two rates is not perfect, but casual observation suggests that spikes in volatility are frequently associated with anticipation of the end of a moneta ry policy cycle or are coincident with the beginning of a new one. For example, the volatility spike in 1992 occurred at end of the early 1990s easing cycle and the 1994 spike coincided with the tightening cycle that began in February of that year.  Again, the relationship is not precise and I don’t want to make too mu ch of it.  Nevertheless, it is possible12/11/01 3 that at least some of the volatility in recent weeks refl ects indications that the bond market is beginning to adjust to e xpectations that the forward markets are taking more seriously, namely that this cycle is nearing a conclusion. Another question is why have yields  on coupon securities risen so high? Expectations about economic recovery are certainly part of the story.  The rally in the equity market suggests that this fact or is at work there as well.  But it is difficult to explain the scope and speed of  the move by that explanation alone.  The second factor at work may ha ve been positioning among dealers, speculative funds, and other investors.  A number of strategies involved going long in Treasury bonds, especially at the s hort end of the curve.  This worked fine for most of the year, but the trad ing attracted many imitators and created ingredients for a pronounced effect if everyone were to head for the door at the same time.  Third, corporate supply has c ontinued at a rapid pace.  And a fourth factor cited recently is the reputed impact of hedging by large mortgage investors. With rates rising, mortgage  investors tend to sell Treasuries to maintain their duration targets, a point I’ ll talk about a bit more in a minute.  Finally, there may have been a calendar effect.  November 30th is the fiscal year-end for a number of large investment banks and December 31st the year-end for almost everyone else.  With dealers scaling back positions and individual traders protecti ng their bonuses, it was not an opportune time to have large demands for liquidity from both investors and hedgers on the same side of the market.  Ultimately, the dealer community absorbed this supply but only with a large price adjustment.  Perhap s any one of these reasons alone would not explain the fluctuations we’ve ob served, but a shift in perceptions, a position overhang, a price insensitive group of hedgers, and a risk-averse dealer community came together at a delicate point in time.   The fourth factor I m entioned was the importance of the mortgage market.  That market has grown substantially in recent years, increasingly influencing the Treasury market.  The top panel on page 3 graphs the outstanding supply of publicly held Treasuries and the outst anding supply of mortgage-backed securities (MBS). Five years ago the Tr easury market was twice the size of the MBS market.  Now the two are converging.  And if one takes a broader definition of the MBS market, its size is bigger still. The bottom panel graphs the yield on the 10-year Treasury note and the estimated duration of the aggregat e MBS market from September 4th to December 7th of this year. I should stress th at this is an estimate by one investment bank and differing assumptions regarding prepayment speeds could change the duration, though the overall patte rn should be similar.  When yields fell in September and October the durati on of mortgage-backed securities also fell, as prepayments rose and invest ors received cash flow sooner than expected. In that environment, asset managers will buy Treasuries or swaps to maintain their duration target.  Even if  the hedging is via swaps, ultimately swap dealers will hedge themselves with  Treasuries and the net result will be12/11/01 4 the same.  When Treasury yields rose in November, the duration of mortgage-backed securities, shown in the blue line , rose sharply.  Following their models in such circumstances, large mortgage holders sell Treasuries, which contributes to rising rates, which in turn extends the duration of mortgage portfolios and leads to more selling un til the process finally dissipates.   Because mortgage portfolios are managed against a duration benchmark and because hedging behavior is driven by similar models, asset managers will to some extent be price insensitive.  If the volume of those sales or purchases is large enough, given the set of  liquidity conditions, it could influence prices in ways that are counterintuitive to new pieces of information.  That may have been the case last Friday when the w eak labor report was followed by higher, not lower, yields. Finally, given the swiftness with which American homeowners refinance mortgages in res ponse to lower yields, mortgage-backed securities are becoming more concentrated  in fewer pools than in the past.  And this implies that as a mortgage pool gets closer to the point where refinancing is economically advantageous, the impact of related hedging will be larger.  As of November 30th, mortgage-backed securities paying coupons of 6-1/2 to 7 percent represented 60 percent of th e entire outstanding MBS market.   Turning to page 4 and the corporat e market, the top panel graphs the spread between A and AAA corporate bonds  and also the spread between BBB and AAA corporate obligations.  On balan ce, spreads were relatively stable despite the continuing large supply a nd the Enron bankruptcy; the BBB spread rose slightly while the A spread narrow ed.  The spread of high-yield bonds to Treasuries, not shown here, actually  narrowed from 850 basis points to 715 basis points. The bottom panel depicts changes in commercial paper spreads as the year-end approaches. The red line shows the A2/P2 minus A1/P1 spreads for 1997-1998. The green line is the spread for 2000-2001 and the blue line is the spread for the current year to date.  On the le ft side are the 30-day spreads and on the right side the 90-day spreads. Both th e 30- and 90-day spreads widened earlier this fall after 9/11 but actually have begun to narrow more recently.  And both are narrower than in the comparable pe riod last year.  One reason, and perhaps the main reason, is that the A2/P2 sect or has shrunk substantially as many A2/P2 companies exited their CP progr ams and instead issued longer-term obligations, generating breathing room but also increasing their interest cost. Turning to page 5 and developments in Japan, the top panel graphs the dollar-yen exchange rate since September 3rd. The dollar has been appreciating gradually since the BOJ’s late-Septemb er intervention and the close of the Japanese fiscal half-year.  In part, the yen’s depreciation may be due to the performance of the Japanese economy, which has deteriorated, with few forecasts looking forward to a strong recovery in 2002."

First, on the domestic  side, we recommend that the Committee reaffirm the Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations and the Guidelines for the Conduct of System Operations in Federal Agency Issues in their present forms.  I would note with regard to the “Guidelines” that a reaffirmation would invol ve the continued suspension of paragraphs 3 to 6.  This will allow us to continue to take mortgage-backed securities as collateral in our domestic open market operations, a practice we’ve engaged in since October 1999. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.

I recommend that they all be renewed without amendment. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Before we go into a discussion on that, let me note that I have recently had conversations with the Secretar y of the Treasury in wh ich he reiterated the Treasury’s position with regard to foreign currency intervention.  It  is about as close to ours as you can get. The general view at Treasury is that the history of intervention shows clearly that it has not been effective. And except under extr aordinary circumstances , which would be less economic and perhaps more political in an interna tional sense, there is no inclination on their part to do any intervention. Consequently, I think the discus sions we’ve had with previous Treasury officials when we’ve had activist Treasury Departments are not  relevant in this case.  I can indicate to you that as far as I can see I be lieve there is no need to be concerned about problems arising with respect to differences we may have with Treasury ab out either intervention or warehousing. Would anybody wish to discuss this issue? VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Mr. Chairman, especially with that background, I enthusiastically move approval.   CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Is there a second? MR. FERGUSON. I second it. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Any discussion? MR. POOLE. I would like to make a comment on this.  I am, of course, very pleased to hear that the prospects of intervention are very low.  It does seem to me, though, that sometimes conditions change and under the press of circumst ances people do things that one wouldn’t have anticipated.  I think back particularly to th e most dramatic example in my professional experience, the oft-repeated statements of Pr esident Nixon and his people that wage and price"
48,20020319,"March 19, 2002Page 4 of 117The spread of the BBB over the AAA yields bounced around as rumors hit specific names or sectors, but on ba lance it hovered near 125 basi s points.  As shown by the solid blue line, the spread between A and AAA yields actually narrowed somewhat during the period. The trend of narrowing spreads is more pronounced in the lower quality sectors of emerging-market debt a nd high-yield markets.  Both the EMBI+ and the Merrill Lynch high-yield indexes narrowed dramatically, as investors’ risk appetite seemed to revive and they priced in increasing odds of a global recovery.  The Merrill Lynch high-yield spread narrowed to its lowe st level since September 2000, and the EMBI+ spread narrowed to its tightest level since July 1998, but the recent recomposition of the EMBI index exagge rates the scale of that improvement.   Turning to page 3, volatility trends in major asset markets are shown in the top panel. The S&P 100 Volatility Index, also known as the VIX, has been declining for some weeks now into the low 20s—at the lowe r end of its range of the last six or seven years of 20 to 35 or 40 percent. In general, high levels have been associated with periods of stress and falli ng equity prices.  Some analysts have asserted that the current level of implied volatility suggests a complacent attitude among investors.  Others, however, note that equity volatility  above 20 percent is a relatively recent phenomenon; before 1995 equity volatilities were frequen tly in the 10 to 15 percent range. These analysts sugge st that, with the boom and bust behind us, a period of more-modest returns may be consistent with  a reversion toward lower volatilities.  The middle panel graphs the im plied volatility of the Eurodollar interest rate futures contract. That volatility ha d stayed at a high level in the months after September 11 but recently has declined to its lowest level since that date, though it remains at elevated levels compared with its histor ical average.  Finally, the bottom panel depicts the one- and twelve-month implied volatilities in the euro-dollar exchange rate. With that exchange rate trading in a fairly narrow range between 0.86 and 0.89, the volatility has eased into si ngle digits, and the one-year implied volatility is at its lowest point since November 1999. Turning to page 4, let me say a few words on Japan and Japanese assets. The yen, which had been exhibiting weakness early in 2002, had a dramatic about-face starting in mid to late February.  For most of January  and part of February  the talk in markets was about the possibility of a major crisis around the end of the fiscal year.  This led to a “sell Japan” mentality and the prices of equities, JGBs, and the value of the yen all declined. As the talk about the crisis swelled, mark ets began to look forward to two events in late February—the release of the government’s “anti-deflation plan” due to come out on February 27 and the Bank of Japan’s policy board meeting on February 28. In the event, the government’s anti-deflation plan was leaked slowly in the days before its release, and it containe d little that was new or viewed as being truly helpful in fighting deflation. The one  concrete step was a tightening of short selling rules on equities. This was co upled with the announcement—a few days before the plan was released—of sanctions by the FSA against four foreign firms for violating the then-existing short selling rules. Between  aggressive buying by public pension funds and a short covering rally, th e Nikkei rose about 26 percent from its low in early February to its peak in early March.  On February 28 the Bank of Japan’sMarch 19, 2002Page 5 of 117policy board, under severe pressure from the government, decided to increase the pace of its JGB acquisitions from ¥800 bill ion to ¥1 trillion per month.  JGB yields declined 10 basis points in th e three weeks after that, to  about 1.45 percent.  With Japanese asset prices rising, the yen appr eciated sharply in late February, though it has depreciated to a level of a bout 1.31 in the past day or so. Turning to page 5, a word on domestic reserves management.  The top chart shows monthly rates of growth in currency over the past ye ar and our forecast for the next few months.  Currency growth has been  well above trend in many recent months.  Late last year, just when it looked as if it was getting back to normal, we experienced unexpectedly rapid growth for several months .  Argentina has been part of the story, but domestic demand for currency has also been strong.  The bottom panel shows, by maintenance periods, the aggregate size of domestic financial assets held by the Federal Reserve.  The gray line represen ts our permanent SOMA holdings, and the red line shows total holdings, including repurchase agreements, both long and short term.  Aggregate holdings will simply reflect the behavior of autonomous factors and demands for Fed balances.  The underlying ch anges in this series over time mostly reflect currency growth. The size of our total RP holdings rose quite suddenly in the aftermath of September 11, as we stopped our  outright activity for a few maintenance periods while currency growth remained robust.  Total RPs grew to more than $30 billion, and the long-term RP book reached  about $24 billion in October.  In that month we began to buy outrigh t for SOMA once again; and over the past five months, SOMA has expanded by over $25 billion, wh ich in absolute terms is about as aggressive a pace as we have ever sustai ned over any extended period.  But the rapid growth in currency has continue d to surprise us over the past several months, and the rapid pace of SOMA expansion still has not allowed us to bring down our holdings of RPs, including long-term RPs, below the October levels. Looking ahead, while currency growth is expected to moderate, we plan to maintain the recent rapid pace of SOMA expansion, which should allow us to  bring RPs, including long-term RPs, down modestly from the current levels. Again, though, we are talking about forecasts, and there is a lot of risk to those forecasts. Mr. Chairman, there were no foreign opera tions in the intermeeting period.  I do want to mention that yesterday the Desk made its initial purchase of French bonds for SOMA’s foreign portfolio as part of our e ffort to diversify the Euro portfolio beyond German debt.  I will need a vote to ra tify domestic operations, and I would be happy to answer any questions. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.   CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. How do you read the Argentinean situation?  It seems to be going from one state of deteri oration to the next, w ith the clues largely being some form of confiscation of foreign assets. That leads me to conclude that it will be difficult to get anyone to reinvest in Argentina if its leader s continue to make it terribly obvious  that it’s not safe to do so.March 19, 2002Page 6 of 117How much is the exchange rate being suppressed by the lack of a fully free market there?  And how is this all going to unravel or ravel—I don’t know what the appropr iate term is—in your judgment?   MR. KOS. I think you’re absolutely right that there is a suppression of the exchange rate by the various rules and regulations, both formal  and informal, that are being applied.  How much that is suppressing the exchange rate is hard to quantify, and I w ouldn’t want to hazard a guess. But a lot of people in the analytical co mmunity think that we could see a further—and perhaps even sharp—depreciation if and when a more open market is allowed to develop.  As for how that will spill over into broader markets or the society, I think it’s very hard to guess.  But it’s difficult to be optimis tic about the situation. MS. JOHNSON.  If I may interject, Mr. Ch airman?  I would note that the one-year forward rate yesterday was 4.8 pesos per dollar. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I was just abou t to mention that.  In other words, somebody is very pessimistic at this point.  Wh at in the world does a one-year forward of, say, 5 imply about the inflation rate?  We had the Braz ilian experience where we were all surprised at the lack of pass-through of  the exchange rate effects.  Do we have any evidence yet as to how this is materializing in the Argentine situation?  We do know that their inflation rate is rising, but is it rising with the implied full, moderate, or very little pass-through of the exchange rate depreciation? MS. JOHNSON. There’s not enough economic activity going on in Argentina to know— even in domestic trading much less anything th at would involve the pur chase of imported goods and the reaction of wages or the pass-through or a ny of that.  Ironically, th e situation is so bad that it may be that what they really should do is  let the inflation rip because it would depreciate"
49,20020507,"May 7, 20024 of 81$10 billion last year. Today’s five-year au ction will be a record $22 billion, and the size of the ten-year auction also has increased from last  year.  The thirty-year bond has been eliminated, of course, but that was being issued semiannually and made up only a very small portion of total issuance.  After complaints about a shrinking supply of Treasuries in the last several years, th e market has absorbed this higher level of issuance so far without any evident strains.   Despite the increase in supply, as I noted earlier yields have fallen in recent weeks, suggesting that the higher levels of supply have not affected nominal rates.  But higher levels of supply may be showing up in spread relationships.  The bottom panel graphs the U.S. ten-year swap spr ead since January 1, 1998.  The swap spread has narrowed about 10 basis points since the last meeting and curre ntly is roughly at levels not seen since the summer of 1998, just before the Russian default.  The reasons for both the widening and the narro wing are complex, including the level of corporate issuance that is swapped, the stance of monetary policy, demand for hedging by mortgage and other accounts, and ot her short-term technical factors.  Thus one can’t ascribe movements to any single fact or.  Still, it’s noteworthy that spreads widened during the period of higher budget su rpluses and then began to narrow as the surplus first began to shrink in fiscal 2001 a nd as the forecast turn ed to deficits in fiscal 2002. This may suggest that at least part of the widening of spreads represented a repricing of government cred it risks relative to other risk assets.  Spreads of other debt instruments such as agencies and co rporates show a similar pattern, though not as pronounced. These spreads have not fully retraced their climb and returned to the very low levels seen in the summer of 1998. The corporate bond market was affected by issuer-specific a nd sector-specific news in the past few weeks, with the backdrop of continuing worries about event risks emanating from accounting-related concer ns.  Despite the cons tant drumbeat of headlines about earnings shor tfalls, SEC investigations, and continuing pressure on some companies—especially those in the telecom area—to refinance their commercial paper, there appears to have b een no generalized tiering in the corporate sector. Spreads in that sector are depict ed on page 3.  The top panel graphs spreads relative to AA industrial corporates. As can  be seen in the top left panel, among investment-grade borrowers BBB spreads have  risen modestly while A spreads have narrowed. Meanwhile, in the high-yield s ector, BB credit spreads have narrowed as well. Looking at the broad spectrum of cor porates relative to Treasuries, the spread has been relatively stable, as seen in the red line of the lower graph.  However, the telecom sub-index, which is where the problems are most acute and where a large proportion of the borrowing was concentrat ed in the late 1990s and early 2000, widened dramatically.   Turning to page 4, the very busy graph in the top panel shows changes in the value of a number of foreign currencies—the euro, the yen, the Swiss franc, the British pound, the Australian dollar, and the Mexican peso—against the dollar since January 1. The values above 100 represen t appreciation of the foreign currency relative to the dollar.  In  recent weeks, most foreign currencies have beenMay 7, 20025 of 81appreciating against the dolla r, raising concerns about a sustained period of dollar weakness. The Mexican peso is an excepti on to this trend; it has fallen in recent weeks due both to local factors and to the pe rception that a slower U.S. recovery will delay the recovery in Mexico.  Despite th e dollar’s recent depreciation, we should not exaggerate the movement.  It has moved only modestly lower since the beginning of the year, and by most measures the effective va lue of the dollar is at levels last seen during the strong dollar period of the mid-1980s .  Still, sentiment toward the dollar has deteriorated in recent weeks.  Market talk has focused much more on the potential adverse effects of the current account deficit than it has in quite some time.  What has taken the market aback in recent weeks was that the dollar’s fall was as broad as it was and that it occurred despite the strong first-quarter GDP number.  Particularly surprising was that the dollar’s weakness spre ad even to the dollar-yen exchange rate, whereas expectations only a few weeks ago we re that the dollar would rise against the yen. One argument that some analysts have  made in recent years is that the higher expected returns in the United States rela tive to returns in ot her countries have supported a higher dollar. In  recent weeks the dollar skep tics have used the same logic and pointed to the underperformance of returns in the United States to explain the dollar’s weakness. The equally busy middle panel on page 4 shows the performance of selected ma jor equity markets relative to the S&P 500, taking into account exchange rate moves. So a line above the zero axis does not necessarily imply that a particular equity market had positive returns.  Rather, it measures how much better that market did than th e S&P 500.  Adding up both equity market changes and exchange rate shifts, each of  these markets outperformed the S&P 500 since January, some by double-digit amounts.   The bottom left panel depicts three-month interest rate differentials between the dollar and the euro.  These differentials have been at about 150 basis poi nts in favor of the euro for some time now.  At the long end, shown in the right panel, the U.S.  dollar ten-year swap now yields about 25 basis points more than the euro swap, but that differential has narrowed from 75 basis points in January. So at least duri ng this relatively short period of about four months, foreign investors in developed markets generally would have done better at home than in the U.S. markets.  Should th is trend continue, the dollar’s exchange rate could come under further pressure.   Looking at Japan a bit more closely, the t op panel of page 5 graphs the Bank of Japan’s month-end current account balances since January 2000.  The target has been 10 trillion to 15 trillion yen since December, but in practice 15 trillion has been the floor recently.  And in the run-up to the end of  the fiscal half year, the current account balance temporarily topped out at more th an 27 trillion yen.  The middle panel depicts Japan’s monetary base over the same period, from January 2000 through April 2002.  Despite the reduction in short-term interest ra tes to near zero and the increase in the current account balance over 2001, the monetary base did not begin to grow until late in 2001. That growth occurred as the Bank of Japan stepped up its acquisition of assets and targeted ever-higher levels of current account balances.  That the monetary base has been growing at annualized rates of nearly 50 percent in recent months has caught the attention of some ma rket participants.  It is taken by some as either a positive sign about the near-term outlook for the economy or as a signal that the BankMay 7, 20026 of 81of Japan will hold the financial system together, or both.  Whatever the direct cause, this sentiment toward Japan for the near term, while not positive, is at least less negative. The yen had been depreciati ng in early 2002 along with a decline in Japanese equities—and to a lesser extent , Japanese bonds—during the “sell Japan” phase. With the steps taken by the authori ties to prop up equities in late March and the realization that the Japanese would m uddle through the fiscal year-end without a major crisis, equities began to rise, the ye n began to appreciate, and JGB yields began to decline. In short, the “sell Japan”  phase was replaced by a “buy Japan” phase.  Yields on JGBs have declined despite their downgrade to double A minus by Standard & Poor’s and their possible downgrade by Moody’s in the next few weeks to the high single A level. With respect to domestic reserves, the Desk at times faced challenges in the intermeeting period because of  uncertainty about the Trea sury’s balance, given the shortfall in tax revenues. Ov erall, however, this tax season was less eventful than in some other recent years when the Tr easury was running up against its TT&L (Treasury Tax and Loan account) constraints.   That was not an issue this year. Finally, I wanted to note two items rega rding the Desk’s operations.  First, the Desk began buying French bonds as part of SOMA’s foreign portfolio diversification and also on behalf of the ESF (Exchange  Stabilization Fund).  The Committee had previously approved this diversification of the euro portfolio.  Second, the Desk announced a modest change to its Securi ties Lending Program, effective May 15, as was described in a memo to the Committee dated April 22. Mr. Chairman, there were no foreign operations in this period.  I will need a vote to approve our domestic operations, and I’d be happy to take any questions. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. You gave two reas ons to be optimistic relevant to the acceleration of the monetary base in Japan.  Th ere are probably several reasons—perhaps three or four—that suggest that nothing will happen as a consequence.  So, it doesn’t necessarily mean that the acceleration in growth of the monetary ba se in and of itself is going to work or is going to alter what is really a deep struct ural problem in their banking system.   MR. KOS. Yes. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Dino, on the ten-y ear swap spreads on page 2, what does the spread between the AAA corporate and the te n-year Treasury swap look like?  In other words, what is the AAA corporate yield minus the ten-year Treasury rate?"
50,20020626,"June 25-26, 20024 of 179The top panel on page 2 graphs the dollar’s  exchange rate si nce March 1 against the euro, the yen, the Swiss franc, the Au stralian dollar, the British pound, and the Canadian dollar. The dollar’s  depreciation, which was beginn ing to manifest itself at about the time of the last meeting, continued during the recent intermeeting period.  The dollar declined against a wide range of currencies.  Looking at a broader sample of sixteen major actively traded currencies since the beginning of the year, the dollar has declined against all of them except the Mexican peso and the Brazilian real.  Early yesterday the dollar traded at just a bove 98 cents versus the euro—its weakest level against the euro since February of 2000—and just below 121 yen.  The decline against the yen came despite occasional intervention by the Japanese authorities in attempts to stem the yen’s rise.  On four  occasions in late May and early June the Japanese authorities intervened in the mark et, purchasing a total of $20 billion.  They intervened again yesterday, buying anothe r $3.5 billion, thus bringing their total intervention over the period si nce late May to $23.5 billi on.  The weaker U.S. outlook is the most commonly cited reason for the do llar’s decline.  But concerns about the outlook for equities and the seemingly consta nt flow of adverse reports pointing to weakness in accounting disclo sure and corporate governance were prominently cited by market participants as reasons for fore igners to shy away from continuing to accumulate corporate securities.  And, of c ourse, concerns remain about the size of the U.S. current account deficit. With the continuing depreciation of the do llar, implied volatilities—as shown in the middle panel—have ticked higher, especi ally in the past week.  The one-month implied volatility on dollar/yen, the blue line, has risen a bout 2 percentage  points, to nearly 12 percent. The implied volatility on the euro-dollar exchange rate, the red line, which had barely budged through most of the spring, also rose about 2 percentage points, coincident with the euro’s rally in the last two weeks.  While this level of implied volatility is notably higher relative to levels in the recent past, it is not very much different from its historic al range.  Still, with investors and corporations having been trained over the firs t three years of the cu rrency’s life not to hedge short euro exposures, it may not take mu ch more of a rise in the euro to bring a burst of hedging from a variety of accounts. In the late 1990s, one factor that market  participants had discounted in explaining exchange rate moves was relative interest  rate differentials.  At the time, the explanation was that the domi nant flows that influenced exchange rates were foreign direct investments and long-term equity in vestments.  Currently, with the composition of capital flows changing, there is a sma ll but growing minority that is focusing on interest rate differentials increasingly as  a guide to help explain exchange rates, especially with respect to the euro.  W ith the exception of Japan and Switzerland, the United States now has about the lowest short-term interest rates among the major industrialized countries. And at the long e nd, the situation is similar.  The bottom panel shows ten-year government bond yields as of yesterday, June 24, for the United States and ten other major industrialized countries.  With the exception of Japan, this country has the lowest yields of the group, whereas in 1999 and most of 2000, ten­June 25-26, 20025 of 179year U.S. government yields were as high as, and in most cases higher than, those in many of the countries listed in this graphic. Turning to page 3, the U.S. equity markets have declined steadily and sharply at times since March 1.  The same set of factors that boosted bond markets and weighed on the dollar—corporate governance, earnings shortfalls, geopolitical concerns, and so forth—are cited to explain the weakness in  equities.  In the mi ddle panel is a graph of the S&P 100 volatility index, also known as  the VIX, which has risen sharply in recent weeks to a high of about 32 percent, coinciding with the recent weakness in equities. That rise is somewhat unusual for this time of year.  Often the VIX is seasonally soggy as we move toward summer.  High volatility is often associated, by some analysts at least, with market bottoms.  Nevertheless, the recent peaks in the VIX are not nearly as high as the peaks in the fall of 1997, the autumn of 1998, and the period after last September 11, when  this index peaked between 35 and 50 percent. I should note that the weakness in equity markets has been a global affair.  The bottom panel graphs a sa mple of major internationa l equity indexes also re-indexed to March 1. Their price levels ge nerally have moved lower with the U.S. market.  We’ve had profit warnings as well by some major European corporations, worries about debt levels at some of th e major telecom companies, and concerns about the pace of European recovery. Stil l, with the dollar falling and the drop in U.S. equity prices, overseas investors w ould have done better on a relative basis by staying at home.  Turning to page 4, let me say a word about  spreads.  Despite the concerns about corporate governance and risk aversion, the pict ure in credit markets is mixed.  In the investment-grade sector spreads on balance are a bit tighter.  Spreads in swaps and agency debt, shown in the top left panel,  have tightened along with lower Treasury yields. As can be seen in the right panel,  spreads on A-rated industrial corporate debt tightened slightly, although there is some noi se in that series because of downgrades among some prominent names in the telecom sector.  Still, on balance, spreads have tightened somewhat, as have those on mo rtgage-backed securities.  Anecdotally, market participants report that a wide variety of institutions have been acquiring mortgage-backed securities, which have beco me sufficiently expensive that some of the government-sponsored agencies have slowed  their pace of acquisition.  In the case of Freddie Mac, it actually has reduced it s mortgage-backed portfolio in each of the last two months.  As can be seen in the bottom panel, among somewhat riskier assets there was more evidence of risk aver sion.  Unlike the tighter spreads in the investment-grade sector, spreads in the high-yield sector, measured by the black line, have widened modestly.  Emerging-market  bonds have had a more notable widening, especially with political and economic conditions deteriorating in Latin America, and in particular in Brazil. Turning to domestic open market operati ons and a word on reserves, the top panel on page 5 depicts the recent pattern of curre ncy growth and our forecast for the rest of the year, along with our forecast as of th e May meeting.  The Desk reacted to the strong growth in currency by stepping up the pace of our outright purchases for theJune 25-26, 20026 of 179System Open Market Account (SOMA).  So  far this year we have acquired about $39 billion in outright purchases of Treasur ies.  The bottom panel graphs for the period from 1996 to date our total outright purchases of securities.  The breakdown depicted there shows net additions to SOMA  in the blue bars while the gray bars reflect purchases necessary to offset re demptions caused by our guidelines on single-issue holdings. During the past few years of declining issuan ce by the Treasury, the Desk frequently could not roll over th e full amount of maturing proceeds and therefore had to acquire other securities to  offset the drain caused by the securities being redeemed.   I want to make three points about this chart.  First, the needs for 2002 as a whole will be quite substantial.  We forecast that SOMA will grow by about $65 billion this year. Second, the changed fiscal picture has caused the Treasury to increase issuance.  As a result, we have had no redemptions so far this year and don’ t expect any for the remainder of the year.  And finally, w ith SOMA having grown in size from about $400 billion to over $600 billion in the past few years, th e current $12 billion leeway to increase the portfolio during the interm eeting period continues to shrink as a percentage of SOMA’s now-larger size.  Seve ral times this year we have nearly hit the upper limit of the leeway, particularly in long intermeeting periods such as the one just concluded. The Desk has managed to  remain within the cu rrent limit, and in the medium term I expect we can continue to  do so.  Still, given the expected growth of currency and in turn of SOMA’s portfolio, this limit will become increasingly binding. Therefore, I expect to  return at a future meeting to request an increase in the intermeeting leeway to a leve l higher than $12 billion.   Mr. Chairman, there were no foreign operati ons in this period; I will need a vote to ratify the domestic operations. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Questions for Dino?  If not, Vice Chair. VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Move approval of domestic operations. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Without objectio n, they are approved.

I’ll be referring to the charts that were circulated a short time a go.  On the first page, the top panel graphs U.S. and euro-area three-month interbank cash deposits rates as well as rates three months forward and nine months forward.  Th e U.S. rates are in red, and those for the euro area are in green. The U.S. cash thre e-month deposit rates edged lower by a few basis points in the intermeeti ng period.  But the three-month forward rate fell about 30 basis points and now trades slightly belo w the current three-month cash rate.  The three-month rate nine months forward fell nearly 1 percentage point.  All of these rates were influenced by lowe r equity prices, economic data that came in weaker than the market had hoped, and budding expectations of  lower official rate s at some point.  The euro-area rates, shown by the green lin e, exhibit a similar if somewhat less pronounced pattern in recent months.  Forward rates for the euro area are now at or below cash rates. The market’s fling in  early May with a possible tightening of policy has evaporated, as market particip ants downgraded thei r forecasts of the economic situation in the euro area and as the euro’s appreciation came to be viewed as doing some of the ECB’s work for it.  In the bottom panel, Japanese short-term rates continued to stay low, and there’s not  very much to say there.  U.S. Treasury yields moved lower in the intermeeting period, responding to the same economic and equity market news that affected U.S. forw ard rates.  Liquidity in the U.S. Treasury market has been good, as is the case genera lly in the mortgage backed and swaps markets.   But one segment that has frayed a bit is the corporate sector, which is covered on page 2. The top panel on page 2 shows— with the dark bars —weekly issuance of investment-grade corporate debt for the y ear to date.  March and early spring were active, as many corporations termed out commercial paper into longer-term liabilities.  Issuance subsequently turned down and in the most recent weeks has slowed to a trickle. Perhaps there are seasonal effects, though that is only part of the story.  As depicted by the red line, issuance held  up during this period in 2001 with the exception of the July 4 week, which is always a week when there’s little or no activity. On the demand side, investors who have taken losses in their portfolios in recent months have been reluctant to e xpand the amount of credit risk in their holdings. And on the supply side, companies ap pear to be a bit more restrained about raising funds in the current atmosphere. The middle panel depicts the spread over Treasuries of investment-grade debt since April 1. This is a Lehman Brothers  index, which indicate d a spread that was hovering mostly between 175 and 200 basis point s for much of the spring.  That was an already elevated spread, but perhaps understandable given the accounting and corporate governance issues that  investors have had to factor  into their pricing.  From late June until early August, spreads widene d another 50 basis points, to more than 1 Materials used by Mr. Kos are appended to this transcript (appendix 1).August 13, 20025 of 92250 basis points. Liquidity in  the corporate sector decreas ed during this period, with dealers widening out spreads and reduci ng the amount for which a quote would be good down to about $5 million in many cases.  This has made it very difficult for investors to transfer larger positions. While telecom names have been problematic for some time, new sectors have become tainted.  Energy trading and power companies are one example.  And in the past few weeks, the bonds of the auto comp anies have also been repriced downward.  Representative of that, I’ve shown in the bottom left panel the spreads over Treasuries of Ford Motor Credit and GMAC bonds since July 23. The spreads for both have widened sharply in the two weeks, particular ly for Ford, which was hit by rumors of a possible downgrade. The 7¼ percent bond of 2011 widened from 350 to 450 basis points, and other Ford bonds rose to as hi gh as 500 basis points ove r Treasuries in the past few trading days. The bottom right-h and panel depicts the bid-asked spread, expressed in basis points, for the same tw o bonds shown at left.  This spread in a normal environment might be 2 or 3 basis point s.  By late July it had already widened out to 5 basis points for GMAC and 10 ba sis points for Ford Motor Credit.  The spreads then ballooned to 20 and 30 basis point s, respectively, in the first seven or eight trading sessions  in August.   As the equity markets declined and fi xed income markets turned volatile, the price of insurance expressed by implied volat ilities rose.  The t op panel on page 3 graphs the implied volatility on the S&P 100 equity index, which had been rising steadily since late May but spiked higher in  July and peaked at  about 50 percent in late July and again in early A ugust.  This is slightly higher than the peaks reached in 1998 and higher than the peak in Septembe r 2001 after the terrori st attacks.  The middle panel shows the volatili ty index for short and intermediate swaptions.  These are implied volatilities on opti ons that give the holder th e right but not the obligation to exercise and roll into an interest rate swap.  These instruments are used extensively in hedging operations, especially by mortgage investors.  Both indexes have hit very high levels recently. The short-term swap tion index has nearly doubled to almost 45 percent. By way of comparison, that i ndex peaked at about 20 percent in 1998 and at 36 percent in the aftermat h of September 11.  The intermediate-term index is also at elevated levels and is cu rrently near levels observed in October 1998.  In contrast, implied volatilities on currency options rose in late June but quickly began to trend lower again. None of the three major curr ency pairs is now near the peak levels observed in either 1998 or 2001. Part of th e reason currency volat ilities have been restrained is perhaps that speculative positio ns appear to be relatively small; hence there is less demand by that segment for he dging purposes.  It may also reflect the market’s lack of conviction about the future course of volatility in exchange rates, as the major economies are expected  to move broadly in sync. Turning to page 4, the top panel graphs the dollar’s exchange rate against the euro, the yen, the Swiss franc, the Canadi an dollar, and the Au stralian dollar re-indexed to April 1. The dollar had been falling against all major currencies through mid-June, and it continued to depreciate against the euro, th e yen, and the SwissAugust 13, 20026 of 92franc. But the U.S. dollar actually bega n to appreciate against the Australian and Canadian dollars, as investors came to view a slowdown in the United States as adverse for major commodity currencies.  More recently, the rea ssessment of growth prospects in Europe has resulted at least in a pause in the dollar’s trend to the downside against other currencies. The re duced growth prospects overseas can also be seen in equity markets.  The middle  panel depicts changes in the S&P 500 and major global equity indexes since April 1.  All major indexes ar e lower, though those for France and Germany, with heavy repres entations of telecom and media firms, have performed worse than the others.  Finally, in the bottom panel is the spread on ten-year minus two-year government yields  for the United States, Canada, Japan, the United Kingdom, and Germany.  As growth expectations have come down, the curves have steepened, primarily by virtue of the tw o-year note declining faster than the ten-year note in each of these c ountries.  The exception, of course, is Japan, where yields at the short end can’t go any lower than they are now. Mr. Chairman, there were no foreign operations for the System account in this period, and I will need a vote to ratify our domestic operations.  I would be happy to take any questions. Thank you. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Refresh my me mory.  What was it that occurred on August 1 that abruptly opened the bid-asked sp reads on Ford Motor Credit Company and GMAC debt?  Obviously, as shown in the graph, the spr ead was flat prior to that time, and then it suddenly bounced. MR. KOS. I don’t know that there was any sing le event.  There were rumors at about that time that Ford Motor might be downgraded.  Since then those rumors have taken on even more steam.   CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  But General Motors  did not have the same problems, as I recall. MR. KOS. Yes, I agree with that. Again, wh at seemed to be involved was a liquidity shift and not really a single event.  Now, corporate governance and accounting stories were circulating, but these companies were not tied to those.  I think th at’s one of the more interesting aspects about these bonds. The issuers are not in industries th at have been tainted by those problems, which does point to some interesting questions."
52,20020924,"September 24, 20024 of 115the-envelope calculations and concluded that  Fannie would need to buy a very large amount of Treasuries to close the gap.  While there is no evidence that the government-sponsored entity conducted any such  transactions in the Treasury market, those who cleverly thought they would front-run Fannie may have added to the buying wave. Not surprisingly in this kind of market, volatilitie s have been high.  The mortgage hedging needs show up in volati lity measures as well.  The market for options on swaps is a key risk-management tool among investors in mortgage-backed securities. The bottom panel depicts the Mortgage Bankers Asso ciation refinancing index and the three-month opti on on a ten-year swap.  Imp lied volatilities have risen to more than 30 percent along with the recen t refinancing wave, as investors tried to stay ahead of the prepayment cycle.   Let me turn to the corporate market on  page 2.  During the summer the corporate bond market was one of reduced issuance, wide r spreads relative to Treasuries, wider bid-offered spreads, and generally reduced  liquidity, making it difficult for investors to adjust the risk in their portfolios.  In the intermeeting period, the situation improved at the margin, but that improvement was from some very extreme conditions, and sentiment in this market rema ins very fragile.  Spreads on investment-grade debt narrowed to about 225 basis points—still very wide but better than early August levels—as shown in the top panel. Issuance has also picked up, as you can see in the middle panel, though the market s have been very discriminating about which companies have had access.  Conditions in the secondary market have improved since your last meeting.  Liquidity is reportedly better.  And the very wide bid-offered spreads reverted to more-normal levels in the week or two after the last meeting.  The high-yield sector showed some signs of improvement in mid-August, as the equity markets rallie d and the August 14 deadline fo r certification passed.  But in September, issuance has been weak, a nd spreads again are beginning to widen.  Finally, in the commercial paper market, th ere has been at least some stability at lower levels of issuance. I would note that  one market that has continued to function well is the asset-backed market, including the market for asset-backed commercial paper. But even this development suggest s that investors are demanding obligations that have an added dose of protection. I think investors can be excused if they remain skittish—as one might expect after this year’s concerns about accounting, corporate govern ance, and reduced earning prospects—and if they feel  a bit burned by the corporate market.  The bottom panel graphs the monthly incremental return that  an investor has earned from corporate bonds relative to Treasuries of the same duration.  In the early to mid-1990s, the monthly incremental return was about 5 basi s points, with a standard deviation of about 29 basis points. Since 1998 that incr emental return has actually been minus 13 basis points—that is, the return on Tr easuries has been higher—and the standard deviation has more than doubled.  In short,  investors who have concluded that the corporate market has high risks and low re turns would not be out of bounds, at least based on the experience of the past four years or so.September 24, 20025 of 115Turning to page 3, Japanese equity mark ets have fluctuated widely as another fiscal period end approaches. In the run- up to March 31, almost six months ago, there was talk of a crisis in the banking system, given the decline in equity prices on the Nikkei to below 10,000. In response, the author ities imposed a series of rule changes on short sales, which triggere d a sharp short covering rall y.  Last week the markets had to absorb a different surprise when  the Bank of Japan announced that it would buy stocks directly from the banks.  The announcement had a short-lived effect on the equity market, though bank stocks—the gree n line in the top panel—did bounce.  The effect quickly dissipated since the market is waiting to see what else, if anything, will be done by the government to clean up the bad de bt situation.  Interestingly, the effect on the bond market so far has been more pronounced.  The ten-year JGB yield, shown in the middle left panel, was heading to ward 1 percent as gloom about Japan’s prospects built up.  Over the past three trad ing sessions the yield shot up from about 1.03 to 1.30 percent, and this morning it was at about l.28 percent.  The irony is that in the near term the announcement has not done very much for stocks but has adversely affected JGB prices, which itself is a major asset class for Japanese banks. While the long end of the curve is backi ng up, the short end is in demand, at least for the time being, even at rates that are eff ectively or actually at zero.  The Ministry of Finance’s Treasury bill and financing bill auctions have been stopping out at about 0.1 basis point. Now, you might think this would be an asset that would not be in much demand.  But the bid-to-cover ratios in  recent auctions have been about 700 to 1 or 800 to 1, and in fact, it appears that  about half the accepted bids at recent auctions were at par. That is, investor s were incurring the admi nistrative cost to buy the bills at no return rather than take th e credit risk of just leaving the money in a commercial bank. As for the banks themselves, they, too, ha ve a lot of cash looking for a home.  The middle right panel shows the growth of de posits since the early 1990s and also the contraction of loans during that same peri od.  With that much excess cash sloshing around the markets—and little in the wa y of investment opportunity—market participants expect the current environment to persist and, if anything, see more of the yield curve get pulled down toward zero. The bottom panel graphs the current yield curve, the solid red line, along with two other snapshot s—from one year ago and from eighteen months ago before the Bank of Japan reverted to its zero interest rate policy. The current two-year yield is at about 5 basis points, and the middle of the curve is being tugged lower by the weight of all that cash looking for a home.  As yet, however, this strategy has not helped to pu ll Japan out of its period of stagnation.   Turning to euro area markets briefly on page 4, the top panel graphs the three-month euro deposit libor rate, shown in black, and the three- month, six-month, and nine-month forward rates of that same th ree-month deposit.  Those forward rates, which earlier this summer had been trading at a premium to the cash rate are now trading about 30 basis point be low it, despite word from the ECB suggesting that it is very comfortable with the current stance of policy.  In part the same set of economic and political factors that affected U.S. exp ectations are affecting euro area rates.September 24, 20026 of 115Forecasts for growth are receding quickly, a fact that has also been reflected in equity markets.  European stock indexes have fallen sharply this summer.  Since June 3, the Dow-Jones euro stocks index—a  broad index of major companies in the euro area, represented by the solid re d line—has fallen more than 30 percent, including declines yesterday and today. The sector that has been hit hardest and led the decline is the insurance sector—the dashed red line—which has seen its market value cut in half during that time.  Europe’s insurance industry has been hit by losses not only related to the terror ist attacks, the floods in Eu rope, asbestos suits, and the like but also notably by the sharp drop in e quity prices and losses in their credit portfolios. One question that has been asked over the past year or two, as the levels of defaults grew, was which balance sheet s were absorbing these losses since few indications seemed to be popping up with ba nks and securities houses.  Well, it has taken a while, but we finally seem to be getting some of the answer.  Just for comparison, the U.S. insurance sector has al so seen its shares clipped.  The dashed blue line is the S&P insurance sub-in dex, which fell about 20 percent over that period, about the same as the broader index.   Following the pattern of the U.S. and other major markets, long-term bond yields in the euro area have declined as well. The yield on the ten-year bund to take one example—shown in the bottom panel—has fallen about 90 basis points since early June, including this morning’s price action.  Given the weakness in major European economies, one might ask why yields, which are still nearly 65 basis points above comparable U.S. yields, did not drop even more.  Part of the reason might be the outsized influence of the mortgage market in  the United States, but part may also be related to concerns about b acksliding on Stability Growth Pact targets by several of the major euro area governments. Finally, let me say a word on reserves.  The graph on page 5 shows the growth of currency over the past two years. During that period, currency grew mostly in a monthly range of 7 to 12 percent; through June the growth rate fluctuated around 10 percent, which was above l onger-term trends.  Since June, the monthly growth rate has fallen sharply into the low single dig its and shows little sign of a turnaround.  This has allowed the Desk to slow its out right purchases of Tr easury securities and also to reduce the size of its  long-term repo book from about $18 billion this spring to about $11 billion now. Mr. Chairman, there were no foreign operations in this period.  I will need a vote for approval of the domestic operations.  And I’d be happy to answer any questions. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. You didn’t expl ain why the currency growth suddenly disappeared. Is it international? MR. KOS. It’s both domes tic and international."
53,20021106,"November 6, 20024 of 122negative, but in late 1997 it abruptly turned posit ive and, though choppy, has on balance remained positive. Second, the correlation, which was already high, has been increasing this year and is now higher than it was even during September 1998.   The intermeeting period con tinued to be difficult in the corporate bond market.  Investment-grade spreads—shown in th e top left panel on page 2—remained elevated, though they are off the peaks they reached a few weeks ago and also earlier this summer.  Meanwhile, high-yield spr eads—shown in the top right panel—topped 1,000 basis points in early October before easing very slightly.  The only other time that index exceeded 1,000 basis points was in  January 1991.  Fixed-income investors, whether in investment-grade or high-yield  securities—most of which are measured against the benchmark index—are in risk-a verse mode, after having taken hits in many parts of their portfolios.  Another way of looking at the corporate bond market is to take the investment-grade universe and divide the bonds into buckets according to their spread relative to Treasuries. The middle panel shows three snapshots of this—as of October 25 in 2000, 2001, and 2002. The percentage of the investment-grade universe trading at up to 100 basis poi nts over Treasuries has been hovering at about 10 percent over these past couple of y ears.  More than half of the investment-grade issues traded at a spread of betw een 100 and 200 basis points two years ago, as shown by the tall red bar. That categor y has now declined to about 40 percent, reflecting in part a migration of credit downwards.  But perhaps the most striking development is the proportion of corporate bonds that are still i nvestment grade but are trading at more than 400 basis points  over Treasuries.  From a small number earlier, that group now makes up one-fifth of the market, as you can see by the tall green bar on the far right. That higher number reflects mostly the repr icing of the debt obligations of some very large issuers, a phenomenon illustrated in the bottom panel.  The panel depicts for the year 2002 to date the spreads on the fixed-income securities of four of the largest issuers. All four of  these companies have seen a doubling or even tripling of their spreads at times.  And while they ar e still investment grade in name, they are priced as if they were high yield. Becau se of their high and regular issuance, the bonds of these companies comprise meaningf ul chunks of mainstream fixed-income benchmark indexes and are widely owned. Now, I should note that not all large issuers have experienced a widening of thei r spreads.  For example, Bank of America is trading at a spread of about 105 ba sis points, and Citigroup, despite negative publicity, is at about 115 basis points.   Also, while liquidity in the corporate bond market has been episodic, it has shown some signs of improvement recently.  Mean while, liquidity in Treasury, MBS, and asset-backed securities markets has ge nerally been good throughout the period.  Finally, I should note that th e level of outstanding nonfin ancial commercial paper continued to decline in recent weeks and is  now nearly 40 percent lower than it was a year ago. And as we approach year-end, the A1-P1/A2-P2 spreads have begun to widen just a bit, especially for thirty-day paper, but at least so far that widening has been much less pronounced than we saw a year ago.November 6, 20025 of 122Turning to Europe on page 3, the top pa nel graphs the three-month euro deposit libor fixing and three-, six- , and nine-month forward rates.  Forward rates, which were trading above cash rates early in the summer, have been steadily declining as forecasts for euro-area growth have continued to be reduced.  Forward rate agreements are now trading below cash ra tes, and the market widely expects a reduction in the ECB’s official target ra te before year-end, perhaps as early as tomorrow.  With Europe’s slowdown, euro-ar ea corporate spreads have also widened, although perhaps not by as much as parts of our own bond market.  In Europe the widening has been most pronounced at lower quality levels, such as the BBB, shown in the green line of the middle panel.  Meanwhile, issuance—shown in the bottom panel—has been falling as in the United Stat es, but the full credit picture in Europe is more difficult to gauge given the greate r reliance on bank financing by European companies. Moving to Japan on page 4, the market there has been on a bit of a roller coaster ride recently, reacting to every little report about the likelihood, timing, size, and speed of the government’s plan to clean up the banking system.  At the time of your last meeting, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) had ju st announced its intention to buy equities from Japanese commercial banks.  At fi rst, Japanese government bond (JGB) yields spiked higher to about 1.3 pe rcent, but they quickly retrac ed that rise as the market began to doubt the economic significan ce of the BOJ’s announcement. Then the cabinet reshuffle and the nomination of a new economic and regulatory czar raised the possibility that stronger action mi ght be forthcoming to cleanse the nonperforming loan problem.  While that mi ght have been viewed as a negative for JGBs, given the prospect of large government expenditures, in the short run the effect has been to firm up sentiment that keeping money in the banking system is risky.  So JGBs again have become attractive as a safe haven.  The government’s plan, when finally announced, was viewed as rather gene ral and a bit less than was hoped for or expected. With reform on a slower track  again, JGBs continued to decline below 1 percent. The last time that JGB yields  were below 1 percent was in November 1998. The other development was the BOJ’s own announcement on October 30 that it would increase the pace of  its JGB purchases and its  current account balances target. But that was shrugged off, as  much as anything, by the marketplace.  Meanwhile, bank stocks fell with the cabinet reshuffle, suggesting that investors in these stocks at least were taking the pr obability of reform more seriously.  The biggest fall in stock prices—the bottom panel—was for stocks of the three large banks thought to be at risk of a government takeover. Finally, let me say a word on reserves. The chart on page 5 depicts, for each maintenance period, average values for th e three basic components of our total holdings of domestic financial assets—that is, for the permanent System Open Market Account, long-term repurchase agreements, and our short-term operations.  This chart shows actual or projected values for the one-year period from February 2002 through February 2003, starting and ending at the seasonal trough for currency. Through July 2002, currency growth continued to contribut e to a steady expans ion of our totalNovember 6, 20026 of 122domestic financial holdings, achieved almost  entirely with growth in our permanent SOMA holdings. From July to October, th e total size of the portfolio generally has been flat, and it even shrank a bit recently.  This shrinkage reflect ed essentially flat currency growth combined with movement in  some autonomous factors that added to reserve balances, most noticeably the foreign repo pool.  To maintain the total domestic portfolio at the appropriate leve l, long-term repos were compressed, falling from $18 billion in June to just about $6 b illion in late October.  Having the long-term repo book allowed us to compress our balance sheet quickly without selling assets from SOMA or engaging in longer-term draining operations.   In upcoming maintenance periods we f ace seasonal currency growth, and we expect a resumption of seasonally adjusted currency growth to more normal levels.  The resulting reserve needs will be met prim arily with a buildup of long-term repos.  Some resumption of outright SOMA purchases is also planned, but we will proceed with that very slowly for the time being. By the end of the seasonal currency swing, long-term repos will have been built back up to about $16 billion, a level at which we plan to hold them steady for a while. Mr. Chairman, there were no foreign operations in this period.  I will need a vote to approve our domestic operations.   CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Questions for Dino? VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOU GH.  I don’t have a question. I have a comment.  I think your handling of the account when you had th e reduction in holdings was very well done.   MR. KOS. The person responsible [ Ms. Perelmuter] is to my left. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. You mean you ’re deflecting the bow?  [Laughter] President Broaddus. MR. BROADDUS. I guess I’m a little surprised,  though not a lot, by the strength of the expectation that we’re going to move the funds rate down today.  Looking at your first chart, I just want to make sure I understand how that ev olved.  It appears that expectations began to change sometime around October 20 and that the John Berry article tended to lock in that view.  Is that the way you would characterize it? MR. KOS. Yes, I think you can see that vi ews had already been moving toward an expectation of an easing move. But there’s always the issue of  how much conviction lies behind"
54,20021210,"December 10, 20024 of 87Turning to page 2, the situation in cred it markets has improved markedly since the last meeting.  Bid-offered spreads have narrowed to more-normal levels, liquidity is improved, and issuance has revived in recent weeks.  Spreads relative to Treasuries have narrowed, in some cases significantly.  As  shown in the top left  panel, the spread of mortgage-backed securities to Treasurie s declined only slightly since the last meeting, but it had declined about 25 ba sis points since mid-October, to below 100 basis points. More pronounced has been the improveme nt in investment-grade corporate spreads—shown in the top right panel—which declined from a recent peak of 220 basis points to about 140 basis points .  The spreads for high-yield bonds—the middle left panel—exhibited a similar na rrowing, falling from over 1,000 basis points to about 800 basis points. The EMBI+ spread, driven in part by a recovery in Brazil, also narrowed similarly.  Another way to view the situ ation in the corporate debt market is to look at how much of the outstanding stock is trading at distressed levels.  For this exercise, we arbitrarily defined distressed investment-grade  bonds as those trading at a spread over Treasuries of 500 or more basis points, and we defined distressed high-yield bonds as those with a spread of 1,500 basis points or more.  As shown in the lower panel by the red bar on the left, on October 15 about 12 percent of the i nvestment-grade universe met that definition of distressed.  That pe rcentage dropped sharply one month later in the days immediately after the Committee’s meeting, and it fell still more as of this past Friday as shown by the green bar on th e bottom left.  As can been seen on the right side of the bottom panel, there has been improvement in the high-yield sector as well, though proportionately not quite as much as  in the investment-grade sector.       Looking at volatility acro ss asset markets—page 3—vol atility measures have trended lower recently, but they have risen somewhat in recent days, coinciding with the release of some weaker-than-expected  data.  The S&P 100 volatility index, or VIX, fell from about 50 percent in earl y October to about 26 percent in late November, coinciding with the rally in the major indexes.  In recent days, this volatility index rose again into the low 30s as equity prices began to decline.  Interest rate implied volatilities al so fell sharply over the inte rmeeting period.  The middle panel depicts the implied volatility on eu rodollar deposit futures contracts.  From extremely elevated levels of between 50 and 60 percent in late October, it fell sharply in the days around the Committee’s meeting.  Even though it has drifted back up to about 30 percent, still a relatively high leve l for this contract, it is half the level of only six weeks ago. Finally, twelve-month fo reign exchange volatilities for the major currency pairs have remained low and short- dated volatilities were lower still.  In particular, the one-month volatility of the euro-dollar cross rate was briefly below 7 percent, as the currency pair appeared stuck near parity. Let me turn briefly to the behavior of the commercial paper market, as we approach year-end. The top panel of pa ge 4 graphs A2/P2–A1/P1 spreads from September 1 to the end of February for the years 2000-01 and 2001-02; for theDecember 10, 20025 of 87current year it shows the spreads from September 1, 2002, to date.  The top panel depicts this spread for thirty-day paper on the left and for ninety-day paper on the right. In 2000—the black line—the spread between A2/P2 and A1/P1 spiked sharply in late November, triggered by the crisis in  the California electricity market.  Last year—the gold line—spreads similarly wide ned, affected by both the aftermath of September 11 and the Enron crisis.  To date  this year—the red line—spreads for both maturities are only slightly wider, and mark et conditions reportedly are showing none of the stress exhibited in the last few years.    The bottom panel on page 4 graphs comm ercial paper spreads around the year­end relative to Treasuries.  The left side depicts yields on ninety-day A1/P1 paper relative to three-month Treasury bills.  Th e bottom right shows the same relationship for A2/P2 paper. Once again the black a nd gold lines represent the spreads for the last two years, and the red line depicts the spreads for this year through last Friday.  The rate on A1/P1 paper has barely budged re lative to Treasuries, and that on A2/P2 paper has widened somewhat, though less than  in previous years.  The reduction in risk aversion that helps explain the narrowi ng of credit spreads is  probably relevant here as well. But the other factor at work is the notable  shrinkage in the commercial paper market in the past year, as the mo st vulnerable issuers withdrew from the market and termed out their debt. Turning to page 5, European markets have coped with weak data, lower forecasts of future growth, a weakening fiscal outlook in major countries, uncertainty about the Stability and Growth Pact rules, an d—until last week—uncertainty about the willingness of the ECB to ease policy to c ounter slow growth.  European equity markets along with the U.S. and other global markets fell in September and early October before recovering somewhat.  Th e German market lagged, as the outlook regarding the strength of th e German banking system in the near-term was viewed as particularly bleak. Despite that bleakness, in the euro area bond spreads narrowed in line with global trends. The middle panel graphs BBB-rated and A-rated bonds relative to German ten-year bunds.  Th e lower-rated BBB bonds in particular narrowed sharply in relation to bunds.  And issuance in th e euro area bond market— as shown in the bottom panel—reversed c ourse in November, roughly tripling from October’s depressed levels. Finally, turning to page 6, Japanese markets continue to be nothing if not interesting. The dollar-yen ex change rate, though trading in a relatively narrow range recently, has been susceptible to bouts of  short-term choppiness.  Comments by finance minister Shiokawa eight days ago, s uggesting that an exch ange rate of 150 to 160 per dollar was appropriate, initially weak ened the yen.  Mr. Shiokawa backed off in subsequent days, and the yen retraced it s decline a bit, but on net it was modestly weaker against most major currencies ove r the past month.  Market participants generally still presume that the Japanese authorities pr efer a weaker yen, though so far the price action has been limited.  The fact  that the exchange rate has been stable in the face of these comments is viewed by some as evidence that statements by officials have little effect beyond the very s hort run.  But others not e that the volatilityDecember 10, 20026 of 87has been low for another reason—because the Bush Administration has not engaged in a tit-for-tat public exchange and reacti on to comments by Japanese officials, such as those made by Shiokawa.  According to this view, it was thos e types of back-and­forth exchanges that made markets nervous in previous years.   In the fixed-income markets, the ten-y ear Japanese Government Bond (JGB) yield has been stuck at around 1 percent despite the uncertainty about the Takenaka Plan, which involves the potential fo r significantly higher issuance of JGBs.  Indeed, the JGB curve has trended down during 2002. The middle panel depicts two snapshots of the JGB yield curve—as of January 2 of this year and as of yesterday.  The entire curve is lower, especially at the long e nd where thirty-year yields are about 65 basis points below their levels at the beginning of the year.  Finally, neither the Bank of Japan’s announcement of its equity purchase plan in September nor the Takenaka Plan has so far inspired confidence among equity investors.  The Nikkei index has traded mostly below 9000 in recent weeks, a level that is thought to be problematic for portfolios of many banks and insurers .  The Bank of Japan began its equity purchases from banks on November 29; these purchases in the aggregate could be rather modest at a bout 2 trillion yen.   Mr. Chairman, there were no foreign operations in this period.  I will need a vote to approve our domestic operations.  A nd I’d be happy to take any questions. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Questions for Dino?  Governor Bernanke. MR. BERNANKE. Dino, on the mortgage-backed securities chart on page 2, I wondered if the sharp declines might reflec t a decline in refinancing risks. Or do you think they reflect the same consideration of all the risks that apply to other kinds of debt? MR. KOS. I think the lower refinancing risks probably were a factor, but the mortgage market is rather complicated, and the optionality in mortgages is something that obviously is hard to predict. It’s difficult to disentangle the refinancing asp ect of the mortgage market from the broader trends that were narrowing spreads more generally. MR. BERNANKE. Thank you. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Other que stions?  If not, Vice Chairman. VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Move a pproval of the domestic operations."

I would assume and hope that ther e is no objection to th e incumbent Manager of the System Open Market Account, Dino Kos, continuing in that position.  Without objection.  Thank you very much. January 28-29, 20034 of 195Mr. Kos, would you quickly review your  memorandum on the Authorization for Domestic Open Market Opera tions, the Authorization for Fo reign Currency Operations, the Foreign Currency Directive, and the Procedural Instructions with Respect to Foreign Currency Operations? MR. KOS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As this  was the organizationa l meeting I thought I would propose a couple of housekeeping item s for the domestic au thorization and the “guidelines” for operations in federal agency issues, which go along with  the authorization.  I would just say a few words on each. I am proposing that the Committee approve the Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations with one amendment.  The amendm ent has to do with the minimum lending fee for our securities lending program.  When the Committee first approved this minimum lending fee, it was set at 1 percent.  That was a reasonable number given that interest rates were then far higher.  With interest rates where they are today, there is the risk that if the general collateral rate goes below 1 percent or if the Committee at some poi nt should choose to lower interest rates to 1 percent or less, that would then effectively shut down the se curities lending facility.  If there were some kind of disruption or otherwise a need  for us to lend securities, it would not make economic sense for anybody to borrow at a negative interest rate.  So the proposal that I am making is for the Committee to provide that the Manager would have discretion to set the rate depending on the circumstances.  Having said that , I must tell you that I have no intention of actually changing the rate anytime soon if the Co mmittee should approve the amendment.  But, again, this amendment would give the Manager discreti on to act if need be.  The objectives would stay the same—that is, the program w ould remain a secondary source for borrowing securities and a rather temporary source.  I’d be happy to an swer any questions on this proposal. January 28-29, 20035 of 195CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Questions?  If  not, would somebody like to move it? VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  M ove approval, Mr. Chairman. MR. BROADDUS.  This is the domestic authorization, right? CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Yes. VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOU GH.  It’s really a necessa ry technical correction. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Any objection?  Given no objections, it is approved. MR. KOS.  Thank you.  The second item has to do with the Guidelines for the Conduct of System Operations in Federal Agency Issu es.  In August 1999, the Committee suspended four paragraphs of these guidelines.  Prior to that action, the guidelines had not been amended since 1977.  In that year, agency issues were a large and actually growing portion of the System Open Market Account.  By 1981, agencies were 7 percen t of SOMA holdings.  Since then, that number has been coming down, first because we stoppe d buying agencies and then because since the mid-1990s we have allowed them to roll off at matu rity.  But as we expand ed the collateral that we take at the Desk, a couple of  the provisions in the guidelines  got in the way—inadvertently, I think— of our accepting Ginnie Mae securities as collateral.  So we had the odd case in which we were able to take mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by government-sponsored enterprises but not by Ginnie Mae. In 1999, the Committee took several steps to d eal with potential liquidity strains in money and financing markets in the period around the century date change.  One such step was to broaden the range of acceptable collateral for repos.  The way the Committee did that was to suspend temporarily—until April 30, 2000—paragraphs 3 to 6 of the guidelines.  Every year since then the Committee has extended the susp ension of those paragraphs. Since mortgage-backed securities have become an almost routin e part of System open market operations, rather January 28-29, 20036 of 195"
56,20030318,"In Japan, the announcement of a new governor  of the Bank of Japan did not alter expectations of persisting deflation.  With Japanese s hort rates at zero and the economic outlook unchanged, the BOJ’s continue d infusions of liquidity and a search for yield by investors have pushed funds out the yield curve.  The ten-year Japanese government bond yield hit a new low of 72 ba sis points on March 12; that compares with a yield of 1.45 percent one year ago.  In fact, the entire yield curve has been pulled down by the weight of the BOJ’s infu sions, as shown in the bottom panel.  While the BOJ’s so-called nontraditional monetary operations have successfully brought down the JGB yield curve and corporate spreads apparently have followed, still the amount of borrowing in the private sector and in  the securities market is limited, and prices on other assets such as equities and property continue to fall.   Turning to page 2, another way of l ooking at monetary conditions in major economies is depicted there.  The five gra phs on that page show the main policy rates (the blue lines) since December of 2002 for the United States, the euro area, the United Kingdom, Australia, and Canada, along with the two-year swap rate for each currency (the red lines).  By early March the two-year swap rate was trading below the short-term policy rate in the euro area, the United Kingdom, and Australia, suggesting that markets were expecting a weaker outlook and possibly some monetary ease.  In this c ountry, the two-year swap rate  fell 83 basis points from December through early March, tracking the tw o-year note, which itself hit a record low of 1.33 percent on March 10.  In all f our cases the swap rate moved sharply higher last week—more than ¼ percentage point—as markets at least temporarily were willing to consider that the glass was half full.  Interestingly, Canada’s pattern was quite different from the others.  In Canada, swap rates began their turnaround at year-end, and the Bank of Canada tightened  policy 25 basis points on March 4.    Turning to page 3, the dollar continued to trade with a soggy tone for much of the intermeeting period.  Part of the dollar’s de cline was attributed to weaker economic data, which seem to have had a more pronounced effect on the U.S. currency than weak data had on either the euro-area or  Japanese markets and currencies.  The reason typically cited is the United States’ reliance on imported capital due to the current account deficit.  A second factor mentioned by some was the widening budget deficit forecast, and a third c oncern was the financing of th e war.  Traders recall that the United States was reimbursed for the vast portion of its expenses  in the first Gulf War, a factor that narrowed the current acc ount deficit at that time and was thought to have benefited the dollar.  A similar benefit is not expected this time around.  Notwithstanding this sentiment, the dolla r strengthened in the last week along with most riskier dollar assets.  The euro weakened sharply in the past week to about $1.06 as we speak, and European equities rallied.  Some attr ibuted the euro’s weakness to technical factor s; others cited discord w ithin Europe on both foreign policy and economic performance issues.  Still others pointed to the seemingly increasing volume of bad news coming from European banking and insurance businesses. To give one example, in recen t days there have been calls by prominent March 18, 20034 of 101Germans for the government to prepare for th e possibility of having to take over one of the large German banks.    The yen’s exchange rate has been rather more subdued.  The middle panel graphs the dollar–yen exchange rate and shows (in gray) periods of Japa nese intervention.  Although claiming to have no exchange rate ta rget, the Japanese m onetary authorities have intervened consistently when the dolla r–yen rate has been in the 116 to 118 area.  During the intermeeting period, the Japa nese bought about $10.6 billion and €700 million.  That is in addition to the r oughly $5.6 billion they bought in January.  So-called repatriation flows, which actually cover a wide variety of book-closing maneuvers, tend to wear off by mid-Marc h as the necessary transactions are completed.  With the onset of the new fiscal year and a new team installed at the Bank of Japan, the market will be focu sing intently on the policy choices by the government and central bank offici als to revive the economy.    Finally, the dollar also has been weak since last December against other currencies, as shown in the bottom panel,  although it has had a bit of a bounce in recent days against those currencies as we ll.  The British pound has benefited least from the dollar’s weakness, perhaps in part  because of the suspicion that the U.K. economy is decelerating.  But some observe rs have suggested that the economy may experience some negative backwash from th e government’s decisions regarding Iraq.  Turning to page 4 and moving back to U.S. fixed-income markets, corporate bond issuance in January and February in both investment-grade and high-yield markets was fairly strong, in contrast with the lowe r year-over-year levels we were seeing for much of 2002.  As shown in the top left pa nel, the investment-grade corporate spread continued to trade below 175 basis points, wh ich while rather high historically is a significant improvement from October.  Actua lly, perhaps the news here is that there was no widening in the spread despite th e uptick in supply an d the weak equity market.  High-yield and emergi ng-market spreads also held fairly steady, as shown in the top right panel, especially among sele cted emerging-market borrowers such as Brazil, which has performed well since th e election.  Market commentary suggests that, with investors craving higher yields, these asset classes offered a fairly attractive risk–reward ratio at those sp reads over Treasuries.    Volatilities in fixed-income markets have re mained at somewhat elevated levels, as shown in the middle panel.  This panel graphs the implied volatility on options to enter into a swap.  The purple line graphs the volatility inde x of options of short-dated swaps, and the blue line depicts that measure for intermed iate-term swaps.  These instruments are the hedging tools of choice among large mortgage inve stors, and implied volatilities tend to rise during periods of heightened refinancing activity.  In recent weeks, the Mortgage Bankers Association refi index hit a new high—a level much higher in fact  than last autumn’s peak.  In that context it’s not surprising that implied volatilities among these instruments are high, and it may be a surprise that they are not higher still.  March 18, 20035 of 101The bottom panel graphs anothe r aspect of the refinanci ng boom.  The blue line is an estimate of the duration of the mort gages in the mortgage-backed security universe; the burgundy line is the yield on th e ten-year note.  These two do tend to move together since one way for investors to hedge a shor tening of portfolio duration due to a refinancing wave is to buy Treasur ies.  Conversely, they hedge by selling Treasuries when rates rise and duration exte nds.  With the signi ficant growth of the mortgage market, hedging activities am ong these investors can—and often do—have an impact on the Treasury market.  Now, I should mention that one small aspect of the recent heavy volume of refinancings is speculation that higher prepayments will cause a mismatch among some large MBS holders unable to adjust their positions quickly enough.  In particular, some trad ers apparently thought that Fannie Mae would report a much higher duration gap, as it did during last autumn’s prepayments wave, and that this would imply large purchas es of Treasuries and still lower interest rates.  In the event, Fannie Mae reported la st week that its duration gap for February had widened by one month, from minus four to minus five months, which was much lower than the market had expected.  And the gap stayed within Fannie’s desired range of plus six to minus six months.  Part  of the reversal in the ten-year note last week was apparently triggered by disappointment that this gap was not wider, which caused some short covering.  On the bright side, some have suggested that, with the spotlight on GSEs, they are hedging a bit mo re conservatively to avoid the negative publicity that Fannie Mae in particular ga rnered last Septembe r and October.    Let me turn to page 5 and a quick word  on reserves.  Several meetings ago I mentioned that currency growth had slowed  unexpectedly in late summer and early autumn.  The Desk responded by ceasing out right operations and shrinking our long-term repo book to $6 billion.  As currency growth resumed, in the holiday period we first increased the long-term repo book, and in the intermeeting period we resumed our outright purchases for SOMA, as show n in the panel on page 5.  During the intermeeting period we acquired almost $11 bi llion of securities, or just $1 billion short of the intermeeting leeway.  Looking prospectively, we do not  anticipate that the onset of armed conflict will have any significant effect on the demand for excess reserves or otherwise upset financing market s.  In a review of banks’ behavior during the 1991 Gulf War, there was no evidence that banks increased their demand for excess reserves.  However, analyzing that period is made more difficult because of the sharp reduction in reserve requirements that became effective in December 1990, a few weeks before the war began.  Noneth eless, we will be on the lookout for any signs that shifts in financi ng patterns or flows across a sset markets might be upsetting normal conditions in financing markets, and we will adjust our operations or provision of excess reserves accordingly.  Mr. Chairman, there were no foreign operations.  I will need a vote to approve domestic operations, and I’d be happy to answer any questions.  CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Questions for Dino?

57,20030325,"success of the air campaign buoyed equity ma rkets and removed some of the safe haven demands for Treasury securities.  That optimism faded with the grimmer reality of the ground campaign.  On net, Trea sury yields are a touch lower, and the yield curve now (the middle le ft panel) is barely discer nible from that on March 19.  While yields are down on net since the onset  of hostilities, as shown in the bottom panel, they are up from just before the FOMC meeting on March 18 and more sharply so from the publication date of the Gree nbook.  From the time of the FOMC meeting, yields are up 6 to 21 basis points; an d from the time the Greenbook was published, yields are from 27 to about 50 basis points higher.  The reason Treasury yields are higher is evident in exhibit 2 in that the expectation and the onset of war significantly boosted equity prices and lowered expected vo latilities.  As a resu lt, Dave Stockton is facing equity values that are about 7 pe rcent higher than when the Greenbook was closed.    With this backdrop, money market future  rates—shown in exhibit 3—have risen since you met, although they moved a tick lowe r yesterday.  On net, the path of the expected federal funds rate (the middle left panel) has edged lower before turning up next year.  Our read is that there’s a probability in markets of about 60 percent of a ¼ percentage point easing by the FOMC by May.  It’s hard to get as reliable readings on credit markets at a high frequency.  What we have is in exhibit 4, and it suggests no evident problems.  Swap spreads over Tr easuries are a little  higher, but credit default swap premiums have narrowed a touc h.  All in all, as Dino said, markets are functioning well, but they are very sensitive to every television bulletin from the war front.  That’s it, Mr. Chairman.  CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Questions for Vincent? MR. BERNANKE.  There’s a re port of the Desk buying TIPS.  Is that correct? MR. REINHART.  Dino, Governor Bernanke  is asking whether you did an outright purchase of Treasury indexed securities. MR. KOS.  Yes, we’re doing it as we speak.  We had been planning that for weeks, and we decided not to defer it.   CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Further questi ons?  If not, Karen Johnson, please. MS. JOHNSON.2  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  We, too, posted some charts that I hope the Presidents have received and can refer to.  For the most part, financial variables abroad have followed the lead of U.S. markets, with certain timing differences associated with holidays and tim e zones and whatnot.  As you can see in chart 1, the dollar appreciated against most  currencies and on average through the period from March 12 to the March 18 FOMC  meeting.  It continued to appreciate                                                  2 The materials used by Ms. Johnson are appended to this transcript (appendix 2). March 25, 20034 of 29slightly after the FOMC meeting, but in th e trading after the w eekend it moved back down.  Relative to the levels at the time  of the FOMC meeti ng, the changes against various currencies are for the most part very close to zero.  The dollar moved up a little further today in some cases, but nothi ng significant.  So, it is stronger than shown in the Greenbook but not greatly diffe rent from what it was on FOMC meeting day.    As you can see in chart 2, th at’s largely true for most  of the forward-looking curves that we’ve depicted.  March 12 is a benchmark we’re using because it was the time when the oil price turned down a nd when many stock markets turned up, although not every financial variable reached  its turning point on that date.  These forward rates moved up further through Friday  of last week but have since retraced those moves.  So, the net changes over th e period since the FOMC meeting are zero, but it has been a time of fa irly substantial volatility.   The next chart makes that clear with respec t to stock prices, which did continue to rise through Friday in most places.  Japan is  a bit of an exception, but in part that’s owing to a holiday.  Subsequently, as th e somewhat less favorable news came out over the weekend and on Monday, stock prices came back down—led in part by U.S. stock market developments but to a large extent these markets trade first.  Again, these stock market indexes are up substantially from their low points but are not greatly changed from FOMC day.  We have had some news on foreign economic activity that might be moderately relevant.  There is a bit of positive data coming out of Japan that suggests that the economy may not be as weakly situated for Q1 as previously expected.  So the base on wh ich these events are happening might be a tiny bit stronger in Japan than we had pict ured it.  There was today an extraordinary meeting of the Bank of Japan’s policy board, which was called on fairly short notice.  Markets are now puzzled because the outcome of that meeting was a unanimous vote not to change policy.  So it’s a little un clear why the new governor called the meeting and how to think about the vote today in te rms of what the policy board might do two weeks from now at their regular meeting.  Other than some small adjustments of certain limits and a clear statement that the Bank of Japan stands ready to be flexible should markets need more liquidity in light  of events elsewhere in the world—which may in fact have been the meeting’s purpos e—little else actually came out of the meeting.  The final chart, chart 4, is a picture of  recent oil market developments, and I thought I’d give a little detail  on that.  As I said a moment ago, oil prices turned down on March 12.  They continued to fall quite sharply in the days following the March 18 FOMC meeting through last Friday.  They rose on Monday, which is the last date plotted on this chart; today, through trading as of now, they have increased a bit more.  Three factors, I think, are dr iving oil markets at the moment.  One is the news coming out of Iraq, which over the weekend turned ne gative for oil market developments as much as for other things, though that news  was not substantively about oil.  The second factor is that the markets are taki ng some comfort from the securing of the southern oil fields in Iraq and the fact that  a very limited number of those were set on March 25, 20035 of 29fire.  People believe that the coalition forces now have control of those oil fields and that is providing some positive news to o il trading. The third factor is the negative news coming out of Nigeria.  It appears th at the situation in Nigeria is deteriorating and that certain Western oil companies that have a collaborative relationship with the government actually are closing down thei r operations and removing their people from Nigeria.  As much as 800,000 barrels a da y could be at stake fo r the shut-ins that we now know about.  So this news just out  of Nigeria combined with the turn of events after the weekend has caused the o il price to go back up.  But obviously it is significantly lower than it was at its peak and is still markedly lower than it was on the day of the FOMC me eting.  I’ll stop there.  CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Questions for Karen?  If not , David Stockton. MR. STOCKTON.3  I’ll be referring to a set of  charts labeled “Nonfinancial Developments” that we posted this morni ng.  Needless to say, we haven’t learned a great deal about the real econom y in the past seven days; but in what we’ve seen thus far, there is nothing at leas t to challenge our view that the economy is growing sluggishly.  The first chart in the package pr esents a few shreds of evidence gathered from the high-frequency indicators that we monitor.  The top two panels show unemployment insurance.  Initial claims  for unemployment insurance remained elevated through mid-month, and we think that  level of claims is consistent with ongoing declines in payroll employment.  Th e middle left panel plots a weekly index that aggregates sixteen components of industrial pr oduction for which we have weekly data on physical product. The gray ba rs indicate a monthly aggregation of that weekly indicator.  As you can see by the re d line in that chart, there has been some softening in March.  A significant share of th e softening is concentrated in two areas: utilities and domestic motor vehicles.  In  the middle right panel I’ve plotted domestic motor vehicle production.  As you can see th ere, not only is production likely to be down for March, but also schedules curre ntly suggest significant cutbacks in production in the second quarter.  We think th at is likely to be a significant drag on second-quarter GDP, although I should note that  it’s no more of a drag than we had anticipated in the Greenbook forecast.    I don’t put much stock in the chain store sale s data, but in the spirit of heightened surveillance I’ll offer them up to you.  [L aughter]  I think the major piece of information one might take away from those data is that we’re not  seeing a significant move in either direction, wh ich is roughly consistent with the moderate growth in consumer spending that we have projecte d.  I’d note that some press reports suggested a bit of a fallout in retail sales late last week as the war commenced, but most retailers were reporting over the weeke nd that sales had returned to their recent pace.  I don’t know how much stock to put in those reports either, for that matter.  We have been in contact with motor vehicle manufacturers.  Their forecasts seem to be converging to something on the or der of a 15¾ million to 16 million unit pace for total motor vehicle sales.  That also is, roughly speaking, in line with the                                                  3 The materials used by Mr. Stockton are appended to this transcript (appendix 3).

58,20030401,"to be the same as that from those talking heads:  The war is e xpected to run a little longer than originally hoped.  As a result, the past week completed the rolling back of the market rally that occurred in the run-up to the March 19 deadline to Iraq that we spoke about in the last confer ence call.  As shown in the bottom of the first exhibit, the Treasury yield curve has shifted 16 to 22 basis points lower, with very little of that change associated with a response to economic data.  While some of the decline in Treasury yields probably refl ects a flight toward safer assets, the sense that the war would run longer has also been associated with some marking lower of the outlook for economic activity.  In that regard, inde xed debt yields fell as much as their nominal counterparts, implying that there was a revision to the outlook for the real economy with no role for a change in infl ation compensation.  Also supporting this notion, equity prices—the subject of exhi bit 2—have fallen 2 to 3¾ percent since the March 19 deadline.  Although prices have been  volatile ex post, implied volatility (the middle panel) is lower.  That’s a t opic that Dino already ha s raised, and one I’ll come back to later.  Given the revision to the economic outl ook, market participants have marked down futures rates in the short run, as shown in exhibit 3.  That is, the path of the expected federal funds rate (the middle left panel) is noticeably lower than it was before the deadline, with the expected funds rate touching below 1 percent by this summer.  As you can see in the bottom pane l, market participants put very strong weight on the possibility that  the funds rate will be trading below 1¼ percent by the time of your next meeting.  There’s not much to say about corporate debt spreads—the subject of exhibit 4—other than that they have been remarkably well behaved.  Swaps spreads actually have narrowed some, as have credit defa ult swap premiums for some important intermediaries (the right column in the middle panel).  If you turn to the next page, in exhi bit 5 I have plotted actual and implied volatilities.  As Dino menti oned, implied volatilities across asset classes—that is, interest rate instruments such as the two-year and ten-year swap volatilities (the top two panels) and equity indexes such as the S&P and the Nasdaq (the bottom two panels)—have moved sideways or if anything have fallen a bit.  But what has happened is that actual volatility has rise n over the last couple of weeks toward that level of implied volatilities.  That is, in effect trading has been volatile—fulfilling the expectations that market pa rticipants had in advance.  Turning to the last set of charts, exhibit 6, and looking at the enti re term structure, you can see that volatility has increased at the very front e nd of the swap yield curve.  Implied volatilities for contracts of less than one year in maturity (the solid line in the top left panel) have gone higher.  But for longer-term instruments they really haven’t changed that much.  So we have a situat ion in which markets are volatile, as was anticipated.  But it’s a volatili ty that is expected to occur only in the near term.  That’s all I have to report, Mr. Chairman.  April 1, 20034 of 34CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Questions for Vi ncent?  Hearing none, I turn to Karen Johnson. MS. JOHNSON.2  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The signals with respect to economic activity in the rest of the world re main mixed.  The theme that one hears in various reports from abroad is still great uncertainty, and it is the uncertainty more than anything else that seems to be lo oming large in the minds of other policy officials.  In the package of charts that we distributed, entitled “Recent Developments in International Financial Markets,” the firs t chart shows exchange rate developments.  In the week since you last met, the weighted  average value of the dollar relative to other major currencies is down a bit, as s hown in the dotted blue  line in the bottom panel.  And as you can see in the top panel, it’s noticeably down against the euro (the red line) and the yen (the black line).  Th e broad dollar, a measure that brings in currencies such as the Mexican peso and th e currencies of other developing countries, is shown as the black line in the bottom panel.  That is back  almost to where it was on March 12, the date we used as a benchmark because that was the peak in oil prices, the start of the stock market rally, and the beginning of a bit of a dollar rally.  A host of small bits of data have co me out about economic activity abroad, though very little of that is post the onset of  war.  For the most part the data are mixed, but for some countries, particularly those in the euro area, they are somewhat to the soft side.  The confidence surveys from the euro area, for example, were down sharply in March.  In particular, the Germ an IFO survey, which was consistent with the broader euro average and did have some responses since the outbreak of hostilities, was down substantially.  Retail sales in Germany have been down.  Today we got the PMI for the euro area.  It was slightly above 50 in February and is now at 48.4 for March.  All the components are lowe r, with new orders and employment actually at multiyear lows.  So the pictur e for the euro area economy is confirming softness; whether it’s softer than in the Greenbook projection is hard to tell with only these fragments of data.  We’ve also rece ived several pieces of weak data for the United Kingdom.  The picture for Japan is , if anything, perhaps slightly the other way.  It’s still quite mixed but may be a bit less negative than the characterization we gave in the Greenbook.  We’ve had data on household consumption in Japan that indicate positive growth.  On the othe r hand, today we got the Tankan index of business conditions, and it was weaker than e xpected and painted a rather pessimistic view of the business outlook.  All in all I think the data  have figured a little in exchange rate moves, but I would tend to agree with Dino and Vincent that the war news more than these tidbits of economic data have moved markets around.  On the whole the dollar has tended to depreciate but only by a small amount, as chart 1 shows.  In chart 2 we have some indicators of how the market perceives policy prospects abroad.  The ECB Council will be meeting this Thursday, two days from now.  Statements made by ECB officials suggest strongly that they  are anticipating no                                                  2 The materials used by Ms. Johnson are appended to this transcript (appendix 2). April 1, 20035 of 34change in policy on Thursday; they point to  the extreme amount of uncertainty as a reason for not moving. The market in the futures sense is not pricing in a move on Thursday, but if you look at the three- month Eurocurrency futures rates for the euro—the second panel on the left—you can see that the curve has shifted down.  The rates today (the black line) versus those a week ago (the dashed red line) clearly indicate that the market is pricing in some additional eas ing.  One can argue about the amount versus the probability, but clearly market players are expecting more easing in the euro area, certainly by September.  The same can be said of the Bank of England and the sterling curve.  That curv e has shifted down (the black line relative to the red dashed line), pricing in ea sing by the Bank of England—not immediately but certainly by June and perhap s even more by September.    Stock prices are shown in chart 3.  They have moved down since a week ago, drifting with a sense of economic weakness and the expectation of a more prolonged war than previously anticipated.  Today th ere was a general move up.  You can see a slight tick up in the last bit of each of those lines, as yesterday’s sharp declines were retraced a little today in most  of these markets.  But on the whole, stock prices are well off the recent peaks associated with th e rally that occurred almost immediately after the onset of the war.  Euro area st ocks have been particularly volatile and Japanese stocks a bit less so.  But Japanese  stocks are flirting with their lows of March 12 or thereabouts, whereas the other markets are still noticeably above the levels recorded at that point.    Finally, some information on oil prices is depicted in chart 4.  Oil prices, too, are drifting with the economic news and the information people think they’re getting about the war situation—m oving up slightly both in swap terms and near-term futures.  As you can see in the top chart,  the price of WTI for May is now above $30 per barrel.  It has been fluctuating in that  general vicinity, as has the spot price.  In the very near term, oil prices are lo wer than what we incorporated in the Greenbook projection; further out they are back to about the same as in the Greenbook.  So as of now the futures curve is  telling us that pe rhaps prices will be lower sooner than one might have thought, but  over a sustained period no lower than we had incorporated into the Greenbook.  You can see in the bottom chart, though, that futures options allow us to infer a di stribution.  The red do tted line for December WTI does have a lot of mass at fairly low prices—say, in the $15 to $20 per barrel range.  It is fairly recently that the shift toward lower prices has occurred and that the mass has been gathering there.  I take that to be a somewhat optimistic sign regarding oil prices.  In Nigeria the good news is that  a public-sector strike has been avoided—a strike that might have complicated and ex acerbated the oil-sector situation.  The bad news is that the oil-sector situation is still not good.  There’s a story about it in the Wall Street Journal  today that’s pretty negative.  In Venezuela, production is actually holding at somewhat higher leve ls than one might have expected, and that is a bit of good news.  That’s all I have for today.  CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Dino, you’ll have a shot at him in person next month!  Further questions for Dino?  If not, Vincent Reinhart. MR. REINHART.1  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I’ll be referring to the materials that were sent out to you about an hour or so ago.  Once again, financial market quotes have mirrored the changing fortunes of war.  As seen in the top panel of your first exhibit, through 11:00 this morning Treasury yields have risen about a dozen basis points since your conference call last week.  That plac es the current yield curve (as shown in the middle left panel) about where it was just before the war began.  Equity prices, the subject of exhibit 2, have moved in tandem  with interest rates.  The rally over the past five trading days implies that major indexes (shown in the bottom panel) are little changed on ne t since the onset of hostilit ies.  I’d note that implied volatility on the S&P 500 (the middl e panel) has edged off a bit.    As shown in the top panel of exhibit 3, n ear-term money market futures rates have risen in the past week, especially at furthe r ahead maturities.  On  net, the path of expected futures rates (shown in the middle left panel) has apparently rotated down relative to what investors antic ipated three weeks ago.  In the very near term, a little less weight is being placed on policy ease.  The solid line is a touch above the dotted line in the middle left panel, and the proba bility of a funds rate of 1 percent by the May 6 meeting (shown in the bottom panel) has fallen to that of a coin toss.  Such a judgment, though, depends on the swing of ju st a couple of basis points.  More evident is the decline in expected rate s for next year, which are off about ¼ percentage point since March 19.  As shown in exhibit 4, credit spreads have  narrowed a bit further, with swap spreads (the top panel) edgi ng lower.  For the key financial intermediaries (shown in the middle panel), share prices since March 19 are higher on net, and credit default premiums have fallen.   Your last exhibit, exhibit 6, provides an update on the behavior of the money and credit aggregates in March.  As shown in the top left panel, M2 growth slowed in March to an annual rate of a bout 3 percent.  Special factor s, including prepayments of mortgage-backed securities, tax effects, and currency shipments pulled down M2 growth last month.  I must admit, however, th at tax effects are highly uncertain at this time of year.  As shown in the top right panel, the performance in March continued the pattern observed for a while now, given sustained low short-term nominal interest rates:  Liquid deposits are expanding, and small time and M2 money funds are                                                  1 The materials used by Mr. Reinhart are appended to this transcript (appendix 1). April 8, 20034 of 31running off.  After a surge in Februar y, currency growth, bot h domestically and abroad, seems to be returning to trend.  As  shown in the bottom left panel, bank credit expanded at an annual rate of 6½ percent in  March, a bit below the pace in the first quarter as a whole.  Total loan growth sl owed, owing to an unusually large volume of residential mortgage securitiza tions.  As can be seen by the dark portion of the bars at the far right, C&I loans ran off again in March, about in line with the pace of contraction that has prevailed for the past two years.  Th is weakness continues to be concentrated in large domestic banks and in  U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks.  Commercial paper, the hollow porti on of the bars, declined once again last month.  On net, though, the receptiveness of  bond markets allowed nonfinancial firms to expand their debt last month, albeit at a lighter pace than in th e previous couple of months.  That’s all I have, Mr. Chairman.   CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Questions for Vi ncent?  If not, Karen Johnson, please. MS. JOHNSON.2  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I’ll be referring to the set of international charts distributed to you earli er.  In chart 1, which shows a few bilateral exchange rates and indexes for the trade- weighted value of the dollar, you can see that the dollar continued to strengthen on bala nce over the past week.  For the week, it is now up against the major currencies by a little more than 1 percent but less than 1½ percent.  Notice that it has moved up a nd down, driven in large part by war news, so the absence of some good news today—the chart was updated this morning—has caused it to drop back a bit.  But the dollar has been rising fairly steadily, as the news out of Iraq seems to have been favorable over the past two weeks.  The pattern is similar for changes in the dollar’s value ag ainst the European currencies and the yen.  But the exchange rate against the Canadian dollar (the bottom line in green) has been quite flat.  Chart 2 depicts the outlook for short-te rm rates from which we infer market expectations about policy moves by the fore ign central banks.  Last week’s yield curves are the dashed red line; this morni ng’s are the solid black line.  You can see that some of the expectation of monetary easing abroad that was priced into markets last week has been removed.  That’s partic ularly the case for st erling, where a bit of ease is still priced in; but of  the probably 50 basis points in there last week, about 25 have come out as a consequence of recent favorable developments.  I think those developments have led to the expectation that  a global recovery is more likely than it seemed a week ago.  The third chart reports on stock prices in  major foreign countries.  Again, they have moved up on balance but took a bit of a step back today absent some positive news to which markets would have responde d.  Notice in particul ar that European stocks are outpacing the others; relative to  other markets, European stocks are now further above the levels reached with the initial bounce that oc curred after March 12.  In contrast, share prices in Japan have not recovered to th e extent they have in other markets.  The index for total stocks is off its lows in Japan but not as much as                                                  2 The materials used by Ms. Johnson are appended to this transcript (appendix 2). April 8, 20035 of 31elsewhere, and in particular the bank sub- index of the TOPIX (the dotted blue line) has been underperforming very sharply.  So it is the weakness of  Japanese bank stock prices that is holding down overall stock prices in Japan, produci ng a rather different perspective in that country in  terms of the optimism being reflected in share prices.  To some degree those bank stock prices are down because of new share issuance, which is a way that some of the large banks  that are in financial straits are raising capital.  But that, of course, has had an e ffect on prices by diluting the value of the outstanding shares.  Even so, I think one c ould say that the market is indicating as well that the situation in Ja pan is not really improving, particularly in the banking sector.   Consumer confidence in Japan remains very weak.  We did see a couple of positive signs from the real economy that I mentioned last week.  I think one could say that the recent past and the near term in Japan look flat.  It’s probably hard to believe that further contraction is inevita ble but that the economy really is not recovering in any sense.  On the other hand, in the rest of the major industrial countries, given a good war outcome and favor able stock price developments, I think we are going to see a mild but nonetheless pos itive expansion in the first half of this year.    That outcome, however, is heavily depende nt on oil prices, which are shown in the last exhibit, chart 4.  O il prices have come down further today.  The spot price is trading at about $28 dollars a barrel, which is approximately the same as for the May futures contract.  The whole futures curve has shifted down for the near term; but in the further-out timeline quotes , prices are about the same as in the March Greenbook.  As a consequence, the futures curve is considerably flatter than it was at the time of the Greenbook, and much but not all of the backwardation is now gone.  With respect to the risk imbedded in that futures curve,  I would point out that currently we have reports of some fighting in Kirkuk and Mosu l, which are near the northern oil fields of Iraq.  In that region the Iraqis, on the one hand, and the Kurds and the U.S. troops, on the other, are beginning now to interact militarily.  The risk of damage to the oil wells there I think is still an  open question.  At the moment there is no report of such damage, but securing those oil fields will require some military action first.  I would say that that process has begun, but uncertainty about the fate  of the oil wells in that region remains.    The low level of the current spot price and the shifting down of the futures curve have triggered a response from OPEC, wh ich has called a meeting sooner than one would have been scheduled otherwise.  Th eir basket of oil prices is now around the middle of their target range, and I think there is some concern among OPEC members that the price might continue to fall.  A major concern is that the whole futures curve might shift down as opposed to what has happe ned so far, which is that the front end has moved down to a flatter position.  It is the case that Saudi Arabia has been pumping more oil than is c onsidered “normal,” so to sp eak.  A natural reaction might be for Saudi Arabia to cut back its production from this elevated level to something in the range of 8 million barrels a day or even le ss.  That would be one way to sustain oil April 8, 20036 of 31"
60,20030416,"MR. KOS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The markets have slowly shifted their focus from headlines about Iraq to headlines about the economy.  But the data the markets are getting currently are viewed as  contaminated by the effects of the war, and therefore, market participants are really  looking ahead toward the clean data that they expect to get in coming weeks.   So with that setting and a rather wide range of expectations about how the economy will be  performing, the markets have tended to churn in fairly well defined ranges.  The Do w Jones, to take just one example on the equity side, has fluctuated between 8200 a nd 8400 for most of April, and the ten-year Treasury yield has traded in a range betw een 3.9 and 4 percent or thereabouts.  The dollar also has traded in a relatively narrowl y defined corridor ag ainst both the euro and the yen.  So with that kind of “rang e” trading, implied vola tilities have trended downward.  The VIX, for example, has move d down to the middle to high 20s from the mid-30s that had been typical for most of the spring and late winter.  Spreads, both high yield and investment grade, have  been narrowing slowly.  The interesting point, at least for me, is that cash levels  are fairly high and there is demand among investors.  But issuance has trended downwar d, especially in the last few weeks.  Whereas in January and February issuan ce of investment-grade bonds was at or slightly above year-ago levels, March issuance was $36 billion compared with $66 billion a year ago, and in April for the month to date it has been $19 billion versus $41 billion last year.  That just may suggest that there is less demand for funding—that corporations either are funding through internal cash sources or are not seeing investment opportunities.  Le t me stop there, Mr. Chairman.  CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.   Questions for Dino? MS. MINEHAN.  I don’t have a question, but I just want to report that Boston finally got on the call. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Cathy, when did you get on the line? MS. MINEHAN.  At the end of Dino’s presentation. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  He left the more  important information until the end for you!  Vincent Reinhart. MR. REINHART.1  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Given that Dino has run down market developments of late, I’d like to review very briefly the net changes since the staff forecast for the March meeting was put to bed and then focus on the current configuration of expectations about monetary policy.  In doing  that I’ll be referring to the material on financial markets that was distributed to you earlier.  As can be seen in the top panel of your fi rst exhibit, Treasury yields have marched unsteadily higher over the past month to post net increases, as presented in the bottom                                                 1 The materials used by Mr. Reinhart are appended to this transcript (appendix 1).  April 16, 20034 of 47panel, of 24 to 38 basis points.  Note that  indexed debt yields  moved up even more, suggesting a shift in expectations about the prospects for the real economy.  But this is probably more manifest in the review of equity markets in exhibit 2.  Major equity indexes are currently about 10 percent hi gher than when the Greenbook was closed, and a forward-looking measure of share pri ce volatility (shown in the middle panel) has moved noticeably lower.  As shown in the top panel of exhibit 3, n ear-term money market futures rates have extended their rise from their low point at the end of March.  On net, the path of expected futures rates (in the middle left panel) has shifted up about 25 basis points fairly evenly across the maturity structure.   The shifting up of the very front end of the expected path of rates a ppears consistent with an unw inding of any expectation of an intermeeting move, a notion that ha d gained some currency among market participants in the previous two weeks.  More-recent market commentary appears consistent with the belief that policy easing, if it comes at all, will be deferred.  Indeed, the May futures contracts can be r ead as implying that much less weight is now being placed on policy ease, with the pr obability of a ¼ point easing move at the May 6 meeting (shown in the bottom panel) having fallen to 1 in 4.    As for private markets, in exhibit 4 you’ll see that swap spreads on balance have declined just a touch over the month sin ce March 12.  Also, share prices for key intermediaries (shown in the middle panel) are up more than the general market, and their credit default swap premiums have come in some.  That’s all I have, Mr. Chairman.  CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Is there anything special in the implie d volatility numbers, especially in the stock market? MR. REINHART.  The middle panel of exhibit 2 shows equity volatility. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  That indicates a downward draft from March 9 through March 15. MR. REINHART.  Yes.  That importantly is re lated to the increase in the level of equity prices.  We often observe that inverse correlation. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  So it’s really not  telling us anything different from the S&P 100 itself? April 16, 20035 of 47MR. REINHART.  I think one could probably sa y that about nearly every figure in this presentation.  Share prices are higher on balance, and that has been associated with increases in yields and declines in volatilities.   CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Further questions for Vincent?  If not, Karen Johnson. MS. JOHNSON.2  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I will be referring to the charts entitled “International Financial Markets” that  we sent out to you.  I would agree with Dino’s characterization that the changes we’v e seen in global financial markets and in the information we get from market chitchat reflect a swing back to a focus on economic news from war news.  Economic developments, such as they are, are the factors that are moving these markets.  Over the past week since your previous conference call, there has been no really dramatic trend that these markets have shared in common.  In some sense the m oves are sideways or only slightly up or down across these markets.  Chart 1 depicts selected exchange rates.  In the eight days since your previous conference call last Tuesday, the dollar ha s moved down just a bit on a weighted-average nominal basis against the major fo reign currencies—that’s the dotted blue line in the bottom chart.  In particular , the dollar has been moving down in most recent days against the euro and the Canadian  dollar.  The Bank of Canada raised its official lending rate 25 basi s points this week.  Bank officials cited inflation and the implications for activity of capacity utilization of resources as reasons for the increase and referred as well to what they perceive d to be a better bala nce with respect to factors coming from outside the Canadian economy.  The yen ve rsus the dollar has moved largely sideways.  We have been tracking commercial bank deposits with the Bank of Japan as carried on the balance sh eet of the Bank of Japan.  Those deposits grossed 35 trillion yen at the end of the fiscal year on March 31 and presumably are heading back down toward the target of 22 trillion yen.  But they have been in the vicinity of 27 trillion to 28 trillion yen for some time now, and the Bank of Japan clearly is in no hurry, at least, to move th em all the way back down to 22 trillion.  If anything, the level at which th e BOJ is maintaining those liquid balances has been relatively narrow recently.  Chart 2 depicts short-term interest  rates as measured by three-month Eurocurrency futures rates on the left; there’s a longer-term look on the right in calculated one-year forward rates derived from  swaps.  Short-term interest rates have changed only slightly, and the direction is somewhat mixed.  They are up for the euro and sterling, consistent with what we inte rpret as a further lesse ning of expectations of policy ease by the ECB or by the Bank of En gland.  In market terms, there is still an expectation that the ECB is going to ease by perhaps another 25 basis points some time during this year, but there is no high probability built into such a move any time soon.  In yen rates we’ve seen downward move s in the longer-term area to new record                                                 2 The materials used by Ms. Johnson are appended to this transcript (appendix 2).

61,20030506,"The bottom panel graphs the investment-g rade spread, which has continued to fall.  If one excludes some very large issuer s such as auto companies that have special stories surrounding them, the remainder of  the index is trading near spring 1998 levels.  Swap spreads, in fact, are already b ack to those levels.  Part of this narrowing probably is a correction from wh at are now viewed to have been extreme levels in the autumn of 2002, when corporate governan ce scares were peaking.  Part of the narrowing is simply due to supply and demand.  Inflows continue to come into bond funds and need to be invested.    On the supply side, although issuance did tick up in late January and February, it fell again as the war approached, and it has stayed low since then.  Dealers note that corporations are using free cash flow and what  little corporate issuance there has been to repay debt and de-lever their balance sheets.  This helps to explain the credit quality improvement, though it also implies that less is going into investment than would normally be the case.    Meanwhile on the demand side, investors have  pushed out the maturity and credit risk curves in the search for higher yields.  The bottom right panel graphs the narrowing of high-yield and emerging-market spreads.  Funds specializing in both asset classes have had inflows, and with only a limited supply coming to the market, the competition has been intense and spreads have narrowed sharply.  Just to take one example, Brazil issued a $1 billion fi ve-year global bond that was six times oversubscribed.  A week ago the bond was issued to yield 10.7 percent, and it has rallied in the week since then.  It now yi elds 9.8 percent.  The issue also included a collective action clause, which did not appear  to affect demand.  The Brazilian real, Mexican peso, and South African rand were among the currencies that benefited from investors’ search for higher yiel ding currencies and asset markets.  Consistent with the narrowi ng of spreads and less risk aversion in recent weeks, implied volatilities have decrea sed or stayed at relatively low levels.  Page 2 graphs long-term implied volatilities on the S&P 100, th e two main exchange rate pairs, and the ten-year Treasury futures since January 2000.  The better performance of U.S. equity markets in recent weeks—the S& P 500, for example, is up 15 percent—has coincided with the fall in implied vols.  As  shown in the top panel, which depicts the S&P 100 volatility index, that measure of equity volatility is back to below the 25 percent level for the first time since co rporate governance worries heightened after the WorldCom collapse.  Currency volatilities  continued to trade in well-worn ranges, near the 10 percent level that  has prevailed for some time.  These volatility levels have been maintained both during the appr eciation of the dollar in the beginning of the period and during the more recent pe riod of dollar depreciation. The implied volatilities in the ten-year Treasury futures contract have continue d to ebb in recent weeks to levels observed in the first half  of 2001.  Part of that recent falloff in volatility may also be due to the decline in the Mort gage Bankers Association’s Refinancing Index, as prepayments have slow ed.  That also may have lessened the demand for hedging by mortgage invest ors and corporate treasurers.   May 6, 20034 of 115Turning to Europe, the top panel on page 3 graphs the Libor fixing for euro three-month deposits in black and the implied rates three, six, and nine months forward in green.  The forward rates continue to trade below the cash rate and market participants expect further easing from the ECB, as forecasts for European growth are still being trimmed.  In the middle panel, cr edit spreads in the euro area continue to narrow as well.  In particular, the lower end of the investment-grade universe has outperformed the rest.  But unlike the case in the United States, issuance actually picked up early this year, as shown in the chart at the bottom left, so supply there is holding up.  One possibility is that Eur opean companies are now going through some of the same dynamics that U.S. companies went through in 2001 and 2002, when they issued debt heavily in order to refinance a nd restructure debt and to extend the term of maturing commercial paper.  In the foreign exchange markets, the euro  has continued to rise past 112 and is now at the 113 level agai nst the dollar—its strongest level since February 1999, which was roughly six weeks after the euro’s  launch.  Investors sh ifting assets into the euro area reportedly include central  banks, Japanese insurance and pension companies, and European institutional invest ors who have preferred to keep funds at home rather than move them overseas.  Although we don’t think of the euro as a high-yielding currency per se, both short- and long-term ra tes are meaningfully higher than those for the two G-3 counterpart currencies.    Turning to page 4, Japanese markets show no signs that the deflationary pressures in that country are abating. The banking s ituation continues to post challenges for Japanese policymakers, and the recent declin es in Japanese stoc ks have accentuated those worries.  The Nikkei stock inde x fell below 8,000 during the intermeeting period for the first time since 1983.  This has again raised talk in Japanese policy circles about measures such as so-called pr ice-keeping operations to stem the declines in equity prices and hence conserve cap ital resources of the banks and insurers.  Unlike most other major equity markets, the Nikkei did not rally in mid-March.  That divergence from other equity markets is de picted in the top panel.  The S&P and DAX, to take just two examples, came o ff their lows rather sharply, whereas the Nikkei continued its steady decline toward and then below the 8,000 level.  Today it is just above that level.  The Japanese bond markets also have been gloomy, as shown in the middle panel. The ten-year yield is trading at about 61 or  62 basis points, and the yield on the twenty-year bond is at 94 basis points.  Among benchmark issues, only the thirty-year yield, tr ading at 1.06 percent, has a positive integer before the decimal point, though not by very much.   The BOJ’s policy stance has pushed investor s out on the yield cu rve and to some degree into private-sector and foreign assets.  The right middle panel shows the recent narrowing of private-sector spreads in Japan, which is not unlike the patterns observed in dollar and euro area fixed inco me markets.  But let me note three points of caution.  First, as we know, companies in Japan rely more on bank financing; bond market issuance is low compared with both their U.S. and European counterparts.  Second, the data are poor.  But net new i ssuance is probably flat or perhaps even May 6, 20035 of 115negative in the lower-rated segments, which w ould help to explain some of the spread compression.  Third, spreads widened substa ntially in late 2001 when some fund managers were faced with large losse s, and the ensuing liquidation widened spreads—especially for lower-rated paper.  Those spreads are only now reverting to the levels we saw in the summer of 2001.  The noisy chart at the bottom left graphs  the TOPIX bank sub-index and the share prices of the four major Japanese banks, a ll of which are down substantially as the prospect for improvement in their busine ss recedes.  Mizuho, for example, reported a $19 billion loss a week ago.  Ironically, th e spreads on Japanese bank debt have nevertheless narrowed during 2003.  The botto m right panel graphs the spread for each of the four major banks between their five-year senior debt and the five-year JGB yield.  I would make two points.  Firs t, all the spreads have narrowed and are converging, suggesting little in the way of differentiation among the banks—or at least less than had been the case some months ago.  Second, these spreads obviously represent very low absolute yields.  With  the five-year JGB yield itself at 21 basis points today, a spread of 10 basis points on Sumitomo’s debt, for example, means that the bank is able to sell five-yea r debt at 31 basis points.    Moving to the next page, one of the star s in the currency ma rket has been the Canadian dollar.  In recent  trading sessions the Canadi an dollar has risen above 70 cents and is now trading at its stronge st level since 1997.  Among the reasons for the Canadian dollar’s performance are Canada’s strong economic performance, higher yields, less overcapacity in Canadian industry, a large energy sector at a time when prices have generally been high, a nd the Bank of Canada’s move to tighten monetary policy.  Canadian te n-year yields are about 1 pe rcentage point higher than those on comparable U.S. instruments; and at the short end, Canadian interest rates are about 2 percentage points higher.  The divergence in policy has also had a different effect on the yield curve.  The mi ddle panel graphs the two-to-ten-year U.S. Treasury curve in blue and the comparable data for Canada in red.  While the U.S. curve has been steep at between 220 to 240 basis points all year, the Canadian curve has actually flattened by about 60 basis points and is currently only half as steep as the U.S. curve.  The World Health Organiza tion’s decision to issue a travel advisory for Toronto had periodic but only transient effects on Canadian markets.  The Hong Kong and Chinese markets, on the other hand, had at times a more pronounced reaction to SARS-related news but perhaps less than one might have expected given the sheer volume of coverage the story received.  At the bottom left in blue is a graph of the Hong Kong dollar, wh ich is fixed at 7.8 to  the dollar. The one-year forward rate moved upward in mid- to late April to 7.83 but since then has eased back somewhat.  At the bottom right, China’s spot exchange rate is depicted in blue and the implied one-year renminbi nondeliverab le forward rate in red.  The discount on the renminbi has narrowed somewhat, but a ll in all the reaction was fairly modest.  Equities in both Hong Kong and China, however, did fall, although again perhaps not as dramatically as one might have expected.   May 6, 20036 of 115"
62,20030625,"As the top panel of your first exhibit makes clear, the current nominal federal funds rate of 1¼ percent places the Committ ee in a region it has not been in a half century.  In our briefings this aftern oon, Dino and I will try to provide some background to help you map a route across th at unfamiliar terrain.  I shall address aspects of the conduct of monetary policy at  very low short-term interest rates, emphasizing the options available to you through open market operations and communication policy.  Toward the end of  my briefing, I shall also touch upon a broader range of policy possi bilities, including the aggres sive use of the discount window.  Dino will then discuss specific optio ns as to how the Domestic Desk might implement policy should you decide to move away from the current approach of setting a target exclusively for the overnigh t federal funds rate.  I will close out the staff presentation by asking a series of questions to get some guidance from the Committee about priorities going forward.  How much urgency you attach to the issue depends on the interaction of your views on the likelihood and costs of deflation, where the federal funds rate will be over the next few months, and the costs in terms of market functioning attached to very lo w short rates.  We decided to cut this Gordian knot in the following way:  As to the first in the list, the Division of Research and Statistics forwarded a memo to the Committee last week on the subject of deflation, and aspects of that will be di scussed in the chart show by David Wilcox later this afternoon.  We sugge st that you put off to the greatest extent possible any discussion of the appropriate setting of the current short rate until tomorrow.    The middle panel of your first exhibit ope ns my briefing with the issue of the direct costs associated with a low overnight  nominal interest rate viewed from the perspective of the functioning of financial markets.  This was also the subject of a memo that the Committee received last wee k, but I’d like to start from a different perspective than in that document because  I am afraid that cognitive dissonance may have set in already.  According to a very  influential paper that Milton Friedman published in 1969, a low nominal interest rate  imposes no costs but only benefits.  In Friedman’s framework, an overnight interest rate of zero is optimal because it implies that society does not wastefully devote resources to economizing on transactions balances.  While the example of Japan str ongly suggests that a zero-rate environment creates other difficulties, his perspective is instructive in that what many people call costs of low short rates are actually rela ted to the unwinding of schemes designed to make holding transactions balances less burdensome.  That said, it is important to remember that the economy would bear ad justment costs twice—once as interest rates fall and these schemes are unwound and then when they are built up again as short-term interest rates ultimately revert to more normal levels.    With that in mind, the first of the three costs listed is the problem of compressing rates.  By that I mean that the overnight  federal funds rate regularly exceeds some other money market rates, including thos e on liquid deposits, many money market mutual funds, and collateralized financing in the RP market.  Were the overnight federal funds rate to fall, those other inst ruments would have less room to preserve their typical spreads.  In addition, the in centive for sharp-penciled reserve managers to trade funds in the market would diminish as the overnight rate falls, probably June 24-25, 20034 of 211thinning brokering in the market.  Two oppos ing points are worth noting.  First, the high-cost providers of intermediation servic es in the money fund industry will be the ones feeling the initial pinch.  Perhaps those are the firms that should appropriately lose out in the Darwinian competition for scarce resources.  Second, there was an active federal funds market in the 1920s; but after the subsequent  two decades of low overnight rates, it withered away and was not  to revive until the ear ly 1950s.  Overall, my reading of the staff memo is that these two costs are inflicted on only narrow segments of financial markets.  Still, troubl e in even a narrow segment of the market can get quite a lot of attention in the medi a, potentially elevating the concern of the broader public about the economy and financial intermediaries.  A more serious concern, also one about percep tions, is that a central bank that eased policy to the point that short rates were ve ry low might be seen by the public as having run out of ammunition—that is, low rates risk fosteri ng the mis-impression that monetary policy is ineffective.  To ward off this risk, the Committee may want to communicate to the public going forward that there is a contingency plan and that it does not envision monetary policy becoming impotent.  The remainder of my briefing will examine policy alternatives that may help to ensure that monetary polic y remains potent, beginning with the discussion of the implementation of policy in exhibit 2.  To start with the most obvious point, monetary policy actions are put in place by altering the Federal Reserve System’s balance sheet, a simplified form of which is presented in the shaded area.  Over the years, the Federal Reserve has acquired a significant volume of Treasury securities, about two-fifths of which is held in bills and three-fifths in notes and bonds.  (Our relatively small holdings of indexed debt are not show n separately.)  Also note that we’re not currently much in the lending business, as discount window credit typically runs under $100 million.  In principle, the Federa l Reserve can spur economic activity by increasing the overall size of its balance sheet—that is, by blowing up its liabilities through some combination of open market purchases of securities and discount window lending.  Such changes are reflected directly in the overnight federal funds rate until it is driven to zero.  At that point, the quantity of reserves can still be increased, but any effects will have to s how up in places other than the price of overnight reserves.  Additionally, changes in the composition of the balance sheet—the mix of long-tem and short-term assets held—potentially c ould influence risk premiums.  Policies regarding both the si ze and composition of the System’s balance sheet could also influence expectations about the future path of policy—that is, expectations about how the size and compos ition of the balance sheet will change over time.  Equally as important as how the Comm ittee changes its poli cy is how that impetus is transmitted through the economy, the subject of exhibit 3.  In particular, as outlined in the green box, the principal channel of transmission of monetary policy to spending is through the prices and returns of long-lived assets.  In  turn, those returns depend on the current and expected future path  of short-term interest rates as well as risk premiums.  Monetary policy would have an additional lever on spending if, as some economists argue, the quantity of liquidity has an effect on spending June 24-25, 20035 of 211independent of its influence on the current overnight interest ra te.  Three somewhat overlapping forms of monetary policy stim ulus are implied from this general principle as listed below.  The Federal Reserve can provide impetus to the economy at an unchanged current short-term interest  rate by encouraging investors to expect short rates to be lower in the future than  they currently anticipate and by shifting relative supplies to affect risk premiums.   If the overnight rate  is already zero, the Federal Reserve may be able to provide additional impetus to the economy by oversupplying reserves at the zero funds rate.    I’ll now give a bit more detail about such policies in turn, but it will become very evident that any individual policy shares el ements of these three mechanisms.  I term the first policy “shaping intere st rate expectations,” as at the top of exhibit 4.  Because the pricing of long-lived assets de pends on the current and expected future short-term interest rate, if the Federal Reserve could encourage investors to lower their interest rate expecta tions, the economy might receiv e a boost.  But how can the Federal Reserve encourage lower interest ra te expectations?  On e possible approach would be to offer some form of commit ment to the public.  An example of an unconditional commitment is pledging to hol d short-term rates at a low level for x period of time.  In an environment where investors were expecting tighter monetary policy, stimulus would take the form of lengthening x and would presumably pass through the yield curve and ot her asset prices.  The middl e panels show how that might work.  The solid blue line at the left  plots the path of the expected short-term interest rate derived from a two-factor model fit to the swap yield curve as of two weeks ago.  (Note that this views policy over a much longer period than the futures-based measures we usually show the Committee.)  The corresponding swap yield curve is plotted in a similar manner in the right panel.  The long blue and short red dashed lines at the left contravene the dynamics of this model to hold the expected short rate at its current level for the next one and three years, re spectively, after which it returns to that predicted by the model.  The consequences for swap yields are shown at the right.  The convincing promise to keep the short rate at its current level for the next year only nudges the term stru cture lower, probably because policy rate expectations are already subdued for the immediate future.  A three-year standstill on rate hikes has a more dramatic effect on yi elds, pulling swap rates in the three-to-five-year sector 2 percentage point s to 1 percentage point lower.  While such effects may be significant, the reality of policymaking is that a promise would not likely be conveyed as starkly as an explicit commitm ent to keep rates low as measured in x years.  Rather, through the Committee’s stat ements and the speeches and testimonies of members, the message could be sent that the policy rate would be kept low for a while barring some major unanticipated s hock.  Even then, given the variety of shocks that have hit the U.S. economy ove r the past few years and the imponderables critical to the outlook, the Committee might be  reluctant to tie its hands by making an unconditional promise about its future actions potentially far into the future, no matter how vague and nuanced.    An alternative would be to make a promis e linked not to the cal endar but to some economic event.  Under a conditional commitment, the Committee could pledge to June 24-25, 20036 of 211"
63,20030812,"actions.  That move toward higher expected interest rates acceler ated on July 31 with the release of the second-quarter GDP data , which came in higher than expected, and the continuing strength in some of the manufacturing and servi ce sector surveys.  Treasury yields had declined sharply in May and into early June, based on the same set of expectations.  Market participants expr essed their views by putting on carry trades along the Treasury yield curve as well as in other sectors such as swaps, agencies, and mortgages.  As these expect ations were revised,  the liquidation of positions—aided by some very strong techni cal factors that I’ll get to in a second—accelerated, and yields rose along the curve.  The two-year note traded to an intraday high of 1.93 percent on August 1, creating an unusually wide spread between its yield and the funds rate, especially taking in to account the various statements by Committee members that the funds rate was likely to stay low for a long time.  The two-year note yield subsequently eased back a little to  1¾ percent.  Similarly, the yield on the ten-year note moved to an intr aday high of more than 4½ percent from about 3.1 percent or so.  The bottom chart graphs the “breakeven” rate on ten-year TIPS since January 2000, calculated by subtra cting the TIPS yield from the nominal yield.  The breakeven rate has traversed a well-worn range of between 125 and 225 basis points.  I would make two points.  First, despite the market’s apparent fixation on deflation during the last few weeks and months, the breakeven rate drifted down only slightly and did not get far below 175 basis points before reversing recently.  Second, the recent rise in nominal rates has been mostly an increase in real rates, which could be seen as cons istent with expectations for an improved macroeconomic environment.    Still, the question remains: What were the factors that led to the sharp selloff in fixed-income markets?  While incorrect expe ctations for policy play ed a role, at least as large a role was probably played by the dynamics of the mortgage-backed securities market.  Unlike earlier cycles, th e mortgage market is now larger than the Treasury market.  Anecdotal reports indicate that a large percentage of MBS holdings are actively hedged by fund managers, all of wh om are using fairly similar models.    The top left panel on page 2 graphs the distribution of MBS coupons as of December 31, 2002.  The largest concentration of coupons was at 6½ percent.  The shaded area to the right represents a very rough estimate of the portion of the distribution of mortgages that were candi dates for refinancing based on December’s average mortgage rate of 6.05 percent.  In  short, the shaded area represents the portion in which the homeowner’s option to pr epay is in the money.  These estimates are crude and require the usual health warn ings, but the trends are interesting and revealing nonetheless.  The top right panel depicts the comparable distribution as of May 31, 2003.  By then the thirty-year fixed- rate mortgage had come down to about 5½ percent and was still falling as we were heading into June.  Nearly the entire distribution was in the money.  However, with the backup in yields, mortgage rates rose even faster than other ra tes.  By late July, the thirty-year fixed rate was reported by Freddie Mac in its survey to  be at 6.14 percent.  The most  recent distribution of the coupons, which is as of June 30, gives a pi cture of the degree to which mortgages August 12, 20034 of 110went from being in the money to being out of the money.  Adding up the three bars in the unshaded area of the middle left panel indi cates that a total of about $1 trillion of mortgages was suddenly out of the money.    Now, as rates were falling, fund managers were buying Treasuries as fast as possible to hedge against a shortening of duration caused by prepayments.  Once rates began to back up, the risk was an extension of the portfolio.  At that point the model suggested selling Treasuries to keep durati on from increasing.  Since the structural position of the mortgage market is we ll known, some speculators were no doubt front-running those flows and adding to the liquidity demands.  The middle right panel graphs an estimate of the duration of the universe of fixed-rate mortgage-backed securities.  In a span of about five  weeks, that duration increased from about one-half year to more than three years.  The increase was the largest ever seen over such a short period of time.  The bottom panel on page 2 attempts to quantify the hedging needs generated by the backup in yiel ds.  Each bar represents the estimated purchase or sale of ten-year Treasury e quivalents for each half-month period since the beginning of the year.  The red line is th e ten-year Treasury yi eld.  As with most estimates, these figures are to be treated gingerly.  The calculati ons assume that the entire MBS universe is actively hedged.  That is not the case.  But even if only half is managed in this way, the numbers are still ve ry large.  On the other hand, this graph does not include whole loans held by banks, thrifts, and the GSEs, some of which we know are managed actively.  Nor does it include the ac tivities of the mortgage servicers.   As the hedging in the mortgage-backed market reached something of a climax in late July, the activities of MBS investors increasingly pressured the swap market, which is the other major hedging vehicle for mortgage investors.  The top panel of page 3 graphs the ten-year swap spread, which jumped more than 30 basis points in late July.  Scattered reports of spotty liquidity circulated during this period.  But for dealers and some investors the important point  is not necessarily the level of the swap spread itself but the rate of change, since risk-managem ent models make assumptions about the speed with which positions can be hedged.  The middle panel shows the standard deviat ion of the twenty-day change of the swap spread going back to 1993.  Typically th is measure of volatili ty was very small, less than 1 basis point, until 1998 when it suddenly spiked to about 4 basis points in the aftermath of the Russian default.  In recent years, swap spreads have become somewhat less volatile as the spread narrowed.  In July the volatility shot up again to a level comparable to or higher than th at seen in 1998 and mid-2000.  Occasional rumors circulated again about some bad positions and some losses in the dealer community, and liquidity was reported to ha ve decreased as demand for fixed payer swaps rose.  Nevertheless, the markets gene rally worked well.  And as shown in the top panel, the spread itself has dropped more than 20 basis points from its peak.  Mortgage and agency spreads also widened s uddenly in late June and July.  That is not surprising given the shifts in the mort gage market and, in the case of GSEs, the entity-specific news that buffeted them.  On the other hand, the corporate market and, August 12, 20035 of 110for that matter, the equity markets were not noticeably affected.  The bottom panel graphs the investment-grade corporate spre ad year-to-date.  A lthough it has ticked up in recent days, it moved slightly lo wer over the intermeeting period and is substantially down from Janua ry 1.  The high-yield and EMBI spreads in the bottom right panel show broadly similar—and be nign—patterns.  U.S. equity markets on balance are slightly higher and traded  in a narrow range over the period.    Turning to page 4, the reversal in our bond markets is not isolated.  This page graphs the ten-year yield since April 15 for the United States, Germany, Canada, Sweden, Australia, Japan, and Mexico.  All of these sove reign yields reached their lows in mid-June and then rose together.  While part of the explanation may be that the economies are more interrelated, the mo re convincing explanation may be that bond markets are more interrelated and are especially sensitive to U.S. yields.  I have just two minor points to add.  First, the ten-year yield is now higher than that of the German Bund for the first time since May 2002.  Second, the more than doubling of the ten-year JGB yield—from about 43 basis points to about 110 basis points at the peak—created much discussion about the lo sses on the books of Japanese banks.  But it was little more than discussion, in part  because the rally in the NIKKEI, it was argued, offset some or all of those losses.  More recently, ten-year yields in Japan have retreated to a bout 89 basis points.  The top panel on the next page graphs the euro-denominated three-month cash deposit rate and the rate thr ee, six, and nine months forward since mid-April.  With weak sentiment and downbeat data, the ma rket expected that the ECB would ease policy, which it did on June 6, cu tting rates by 25 basis points.  That is not marked on this graph, I should point out.  The forward rates suggest that the market expected further easing, though less, through much of  July.  However, as the global bond market selloff accelerated, euro area forward rates trended higher and spiked on July 31 after the U.S. GDP report.  The nine-month forward rate has eased off a bit since.  The dollar has risen modestly against most currencies since June, consistent with the higher yields and the more upbeat view of the economic outlook.  The dollar–yen exchange rate, shown in the middle right pa nel, continued to trade in the 117 to 120 range that it has been trapped in a ll year.  The Ministry of Finance (MOF) continued to intervene, buying $19 billi on in the period and raising its total intervention for the year to $75½ billion.  In general, the yen has been depreciating or stable against most currencies.  The botto m panel graphs the Australian dollar, the Canadian dollar, the euro, the pound sterling, and the U.S. dollar against the yen since January 1.  The first three currencies have risen against the yen while sterling and the U.S. dollar have moved little.  The U.S. dollar–yen relationship looks rather like a straight line since January 1 but perhaps mo stly because of the frequent intervention by the MOF.  The days Japan intervened in dollars are marked with small boxes on the red line.   Turning to page 6, let me say a word  on reserves.  The Desk has faced an unexpected decline in the grow th of currency, as shown in the top panel on the page.  That slowdown is due mostly to reflows fr om overseas for reasons that are not fully August 12, 20036 of 110"
64,20030915,"policy operations.  Indeed, market participants obviously had discounted such a shift to a significant extent by driving the te n-year rate down to just mode stly above a historically low 3 percent.  I look back, and I sa y, “What happened?”  How did they get the view that there was a sufficiently high probability that we were going to  use such an approach to lead them to essentially discount it in the market?  The ma rket moved down almost to where it probably would have gone if indeed we had embarked upon an aggressive effort—for example, to buy long-term Treasury notes or bonds.   Two things are obvious in retrospect, and I must  say only in retrospect.  One is that there was a general view in the marketplace that we  would not reduce the funds rate below 75 basis points largely because of the difficulties that would create for the internal dynamics of the money markets.  The money market mutual funds issu e was only part of those dynamics.  Second, the belief was that not only would we start to engage in a further eas ing of policy but that we would do so at 75 basis points using a so -called nontraditional approach.  However, we in fact had c oncluded that we could go very  significantly below 75 basis points on the funds rate.  While we recognized that there would be  impediments as we moved the rate downward, we felt that, with some diligence, these could all essentially be dealt with.  We believed that, if we needed to go well below 75 basis points for economic reasons, we had the capacity to do so.  Essentially we recognized—as a consequence of a numbe r of excellent studies by the staff—what would happen to the repo mark et and fails and the implication of moving significant quantities of assets, including money market funds,  to the commercial banking industry.  We were aware of what that would do to leverage and of various other problems that would arise were the funds rate to sink well belo w 75 basis points.  The general conclusion of the September 15, 20034 of 78staff, and I think of the FOMC members, was that  this would create some  difficulties but, if we needed to move the funds rate down further, it would be desirable to do so.       In light of the market’s belief that we woul d couple a cut to 75 basis points with a move to nontraditional means of conducting open market operations, almost everyone in the market apparently was well positioned, having alrea dy bought bonds extensively.  The truth of the matter is that (1) we did not view  75 basis points as a limit and (2 ) we had concluded on the basis of evaluations of probabilities that it was quite unlikely that we would need to go to nontraditional operating methods.   In effect, what we kept saying to the market  is that the probability of deflation of a pernicious sort was remote; but if it happened, it would be a significantly dangerous event.  Therefore, we felt we needed to have on the shelf plans for using the nontraditional means required to address that possibilit y.  We decided to go all out to find the answers to a number of questions—answers we did not ha ve, given the long period we’d had of fiat money in which inflation was rampant and deflation had never entered anybody’s mind as a problem.  The prospect of deflation in this c ountry had not occurred to anyone until the Japanese demonstrated that it was possible to have fiat  money and deflation—not necessar ily of a pernicious type but definitely deflation. As a consequence of that, we embarked  upon a full court press to get as much information as we could on defl ation and its implications.  We  thought about what types of policies would be required in order to implement an anti-def lation policy, and we engaged the financial community quite extensively in this effort.  I gath er that you, Dino, and others at the New York Bank and elsewhere communicated with market participants to learn exactly what the implications of deflation might be for various sectors of the marketplace.  We learned a great September 15, 20035 of 78deal.  At the end of the day, we made an assessm ent of the probabilities of various developments and what would happen if they occurred, and we thought about what we would do and how we would do it.  Having conclude d our research and brought our  knowledge up-to-date, we effectively closed the book and put the general pl an on the shelf.  And we told the marketplace that we had come to two conclusions:  (1) that 75 basis points was not, as the market had often suggested, the lower limit—that indeed we could go lower—and (2) that we thought the probability of our having to use nontraditional operational methods was remote.   Now, we used the term “remote” all the time.  I noticed that every one of us who said something about the deflation issue started o ff with pretty much standard language—almost boilerplate—to the effect that the possibility of deflation was remote but this is what we would do if that very unusual event occurred.  Even in elementary courses in mathematical probability a remote event remains remote irrespective of the number of times one mentions it.  [Laughter]  This turned out to be a misunderstanding on the part  of many traders who have a different way of looking at the world.  To these people, the Federal Reserve—indeed, every organization—is viewed as a conspiratorial organi zation; and since we continued to talk about deflation, the fact that we used the word “remote” was not the releva nt issue, but the number of times we used the word was.  Therefore, they thought the appropri ate way to assess the probability of whether or not we would go out and buy long-term bonds was to add the number of times we said “remote”!  Indeed, they did that and concl uded that the probability was far better than 50 percent that we were going to engage in a very massive  action in the long end of the market. Should we have caught that?  Maybe.  I’ve be en in these markets for years; I don’t even want to mention how long.  It never entered my mind that that was the ma rket’s interpretation.

65,20030916,"MR. PARRY.  No.  I don’t think that’s what we  meant in the past when we’ve used that language.  I think we knew that we couldn’t achieve our objectives  in every instance, but they were set out as long-term objectives. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Well, maybe I’m sp litting hairs.  But an objective is by its nature something that one seeks.  We’re al ways seeking long-term sustainable growth.  MR. REINHART.  Mr. Chairman, “long-term ” could be moved to the end of the sentence. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  That’s what I’m trying to get at.  I’m just being a nitpicker.  MR. PARRY.  No, that’s fine. MR. POOLE.  There’s language in the Bluebook on page 10 that we’ve used for a long time.  CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Well, it could be wrong!  [Laughter] MR. POOLE.  There’s something to be said for consistency. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  But is it a virtue to be consistently wrong? MR. POOLE.  The language in the Bluebook on page 10 under “directive wording” is actually broken into two parts.  The second sent ence starts “To further it s long-run objectives,” which refers to the objectives specified in the first sentence. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Well, I’m going to  appoint a committee to relook at those two sentences!  [Laughter]  Does anyone  disagree with what I just said? MR. GRAMLICH.  Well, are you proposing to put economic growth and price stability in the long run at the end of  the sentence or are you proposing not to have it at all? CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I think our ongoi ng, unchangeable objective is to seek long-term stability, defined in te rms of prices and other things. September 16, 20034 of 106MR. GRAMLICH.  Right, so I think what you’re proposing is “a fost ering of sustainable economic growth and price stability  in the long run,” which as Pr esident Poole points out is not the language we’ve used up until now. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  It’s not  standard.  I know exactly what it is that we want to do.  I’m not so sure what the appr opriate English terminology is.   MR. BERNANKE.  Is “fostering” used in th e sense that we are trying to create a movement toward an objective, such as in the case of foster parents? CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Yes.  The substantive point is that an objective is an absolute and invariant to the issue of time.  A nd that objective is to se ek sustainable economic growth over the long run.  Now, I don’ t know what the appropriate wording— MR. KOHN.  Mr. Chairman? CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Yes. MR. KOHN.  I could complicate things further by reading the Federal Reserve Act.  [Laughter]  That says that we should keep long-run growth of m onetary and credit aggregates commensurate with the economy’s long-run potentia l to increase production so as to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, st able prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.  It doesn’t say to promot e those goals over the long run.  It just says to promote those goals. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  No, I admit that th ere is a problem in the wording of the Federal Reserve Act as well.   MR. FERGUSON.  Mr. Chairman, I would suggest, given this discussion, that we not change the wording. MR.

May I raise my hand in lieu of President Minehan? CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Well, what do you want to do by raising your hand? MR. FERGUSON.  I know I’m not being very he lpful—and I agree that we can’t edit as a group—but I have a slight concer n with the last sentence be cause of the words “members recognize that going forward they should consider some changes.”  I’d like to propose that we say that the Committee “may well consider some ch anges.”  If we tell th e public that we should consider some changes, my expectation is that  Michelle’s phone will ring a lot, we’ll be questioned almost incessantly on exactly what ch anges we are considering, when we are going to introduce them, and whether we creating another subcommittee to look at this. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  There’s also anot her consideration.  Suppose we conclude that we don’t think any changes are necessary? MR. FERGUSON.  Right.  So I would change that to “may well consider” because we may well do that.  We’re a lively, vibrant group. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Does anybody object to that? MR. MOSKOW.  Just on that point, Mr. Ch airman.  Another way of phrasing that sentence would be not to commit to anything but to say that on an  ongoing basis we would September 16, 20036 of 106"
66,20031028,"basis.  The ten-year note of May 2013, whic h is now once off the run, has continued to trade with a high degree of scarcity va lue in financing markets and with a high level of fails.  In ear lier meetings when I was asked a bout the fails situation, I said that it was largely a back-office event that had not spilled over into the cash market.  However, in the past week we have noted a decrease in transaction volume in this note, and it has begun trading very rich re lative to the current on-the-run ten-year note.  The May ten-year not e is now yielding about 15 basis points less than the on-the-run August ten-year note, and the issu e is trading at negative rates in the repo market. Given the very limited supply and reports that more investors are demanding delivery, it is not at all clear how this situation will resolve itself.  Despite the ups and down of the Treasury market, spreads continued to narrow, as shown at the top of page 2. The investment-gra de spread (shown in the top left panel) continued to narrow.  This index hit a low of 103 basis poi nts on October 20.  The last time the spread was that narrow was in April 1999.  High-yield and emerging-market debt spreads also narrowed, as shown in  the right panel.  The high-yield index narrowed to a low of 453 basis points, the lo west level in about 4 years, while the EMBI+ spread hit its lowest level in 5½ y ears.  A year ago the spreads on both of these indexes were at about  1,000 basis points.  While a narrowing of spreads is expected during an economic rebound as the quality of cred it improves, several strategists are voicing concer ns about whether a liquid ity-driven rally has pushed spreads to unsustainable levels—particul arly in the emerging-market sector.  The apparent lack of fear also showed  through in some volatility indexes.  The middle panel graphs the volatility index on the S&P 100, also known as the VIX.  On October 21, the VIX hit a low of 16½ percent,  its lowest level in more than three years.  Now, one volatility m easure that rose was that of the dollar’s exchange rate.  The bottom panel graphs the one-month imp lied volatility of the euro–dollar and dollar–yen exchange rates. As shown in that panel, the volatility of the dollar–yen exchange rate, which had been trapped in  a narrow range by Japanese intervention, spiked higher—from 8 percent to more th an 12 percent in the days surrounding the Dubai summit and coincident with the suspen sion of Japanese intervention activity.  The G-7 summit in Dubai gave the markets a lot to mull over.  The dollar had already been under downward pressure before the su mmit.  That, coupled with statements from the Administration earlier in Sept ember pushing for more exchange rate flexibility among Asian currencies, made the markets look cautiously toward the summit, but most observers did not expect much from the communiqué.  In the event, reaction to the communiqué ranged along a wi de spectrum.  Some viewed it as a milestone that finally buried the so-called “strong dollar” policy; some were confused about what, if anything, the G-7 was saying; and some we re convinced that nothing had changed and that the communiqué did not  signify any policy shifts by the G-7.  In that environment it is not surprisi ng that the dollar continued under some downward pressure.  The top panel on the next  page graphs the euro’s value against the dollar.  After a dip in late August, th e euro appreciated sharply in the run-up to Dubai and in subsequent days.  European pol icymakers at that poi nt were expressing October 28, 20034 of 126some concern that the bulk of any adjust ment to the dollar’s exchange rate would have to be borne by the euro if many Asian currencies in particular continued to be fixed against the dollar.  Asian currencies appreciated somewhat against the dollar, as shown in the middle panel, with the excep tion of the Chinese yuan, which continued at its fixed rate.  Some central banks reacted with traditional intervention to stem the rise of their currencies; others resorted to  capital controls, restri ctions on access to local banking systems, and various form s of moral suasion.  Although the Chinese yuan spot rate stayed fixed, the upward pr essure on the yuan s howed through in the nondeliverable forward (NDF) market where the one-year NDF implies a 4.0 percent appreciation of the currency.  The Hong K ong dollar also strengthened in the days after Dubai, at first without actions fro m the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.  Given the currency board system in Hong Kong, th e lack of intervention surprised those who were short Hong Kong dollars and had perceived the currency board to be symmetric.  The actions taken by a number of central banks in the region have added a sense of two-way risk to Asian currency rates, which perhaps was lacking before.  A less favorable view expressed by some was that a new risk premium had been introduced into Asian markets.  In any case, with reserve levels in Asia rising, traders are asking a number of questions:  What is the end game for this process?  How do these countries counter capital inflows?  Do  the central banks have  the instruments to sterilize their foreign exchange interventions ?  And that list does n’t even include the broader macroeconomic questions that are re levant, such as the risks of overheated economies.  The bottom panel graphs the dol lar–yen exchange rate.  That rate had traded in a narrow range until September 16, when the Japanese stopped intervening.  The rate promptly depreciated sharply to  the 110 region, whereupon the Ministry of Finance (MOF) again resumed intervention.  This morning the yen/dollar exchange rate hit a three-year low of  108.10 amid token intervention by the authorities.  During the period, the MOF purchased $25½ billion, including $400 million that the Desk purchased as agent on behalf of  the Japanese authorities.  Given the large scale of Japanese intervention this year, I tho ught I’d spend a few minutes on this topic.  The top panel of page 4 depicts net year ly intervention by the Japanese monetary authorities since 1989.  With two months left in 2003, the MOF’s intervention exceeds $139 billion so far th is year—more than double the previous high.  The middle panel shows how Japanese intervention has evolved over the years.  Each dot is a daily interventi on purchase or sale of dolla rs over the period from 1989 to date.  Between 1989 and mid-1995, Japanese  interventions tended to be frequent, but each operation was relatively modest in si ze—at least by later standards.  With a change in leadership at the Ministry of Finance in mid-1995 came a different intervention style.  Over th e next seven years, Japanese  intervention episodes were much less frequent but much larger in si ze.  Individual operations were frequently larger than $5 billion and in a few cases more than $10 billion.  Ironically, the largest single operation is—appropr iately perhaps—off the chart and was a sale of $20 billion dollars in April 1998.  For refe rence purposes, the largest dollar–yen intervention by the U.S. monetary authorities was $833 million in June 1998.  Since the beginning of 2003—coinci ding with another leadership change at the MOF—Japanese intervention tactics ha ve shifted yet again;  interventions this year have been October 28, 20035 of 126frequent and large.  In short, the two pr evious styles have been combined.  The bottom panel looks at the effect of Japane se interventions on volatility during the major intervention episodes in the last nine  years.  The red bars show the intraday range, expressed in yen, on days the MOF did not intervene, and the blue bars show the range on days when it did intervene.  Since intervention typically imparts some information to the markets—whether that is  intended or not—markets generally react with a higher degree of movement than usual,  and volatility rises.  Indeed, that is the pattern we observe.  However, during the Ja nuary to July 2003 pe riod, this traditional and expected pattern does not apply.  The daily range was actually lower on intervention days, suggesting that intervention was constraining the “normal” elbow room, if you will, that the exchange rate uses  in a typical day.  That is also consistent with a strategy that appeared to be aime d at preventing the exchange rate from moving further rather than at attempting to engineer a reversal.  Mr. Chairman, once again, the Desk did not conduct any foreign operations in this period. I will need a vote to ratify domestic operations.  CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  It looks as though  each of the two types of intervention operations had some modest effect on the exchan ge rate and, when combined, that disappears.  Do I infer from what you’re saying that the tw o earlier MOF regimes act ually had some modest effect on the exchange rate but the combined method did not? MR. KOS.  Well, I’m not sure I would go that far. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I knew you wouldn’t!  [Laughter] MR. KOS.  Academics have long argued about th e effect of interven tion.  Certainly the size of the Japanese intervention ha s been incredible this year.  CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  It’s even argua ble as to whether it’s sterilized. MR. KOS.  That’s yet another se t of issues.  Nevertheless, th e rate is about 12 yen lower than it was at the end of last year despite th is very, very large inte rvention.  Compounding the situation is the question of whether th e intervention is sterilized or not. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I’ve been wondering out loud recently whether the extraordinarily significant bias on the part of commerc ial banks and households in Japan not to engage in a significant way in the purchase of fo reign assets—far more so than is true in the October 28, 20036 of 126"
67,20031209,"employment report and the Washington Post  article about the po ssible content of your statement for this meeting caused a sharp reversal in forward rates, and on net forward rates are much as they were in mid-October.  Euro forward rates largely moved in sympat hy with U.S. rates; but in Europe, too, the data improved, and European growth forecas ts were revised higher.  In particular, in Germany machinery and factory orders for October turned positive after several weak months.  In addition, increased talk a bout the “stickiness” of European inflation emboldened those who are expecting the ECB to  be aggressive if signs of inflation appear.  Rate hikes by the Bank of Engla nd and the Reserve Bank of Australia and increases in some commodity prices provi ded traders with periodic reminders about the risk of not being positioned for a possibl e turn in the cycle.  Shown on the bottom panel of page 1 are the two-year Treasury yield and the fed funds target since July 1, 2002.  After a year-long period of narrowing, th e spread between the two started to widen after the June reduction in the funds target and did so again more recently as the market was bringing forward the horizon for higher short-term rates.  Even with Friday’s narrowing, that spread is  fairly wide by recent standards.  Looking at a longer time period, the top of page 2 graphs the spread between the two-year note and the fed funds  target since 1990.  The recent  peak in the spread is at the high end of the range since 1995.  It is narrower, however, than the spread frequently observed in the 1991-93 period, wh en the funds target was anchored at what was perceived to be an unusually low ra te at that time—3.0 percent.  There have also been false alarms such as in earl y 2002, when the spread shot up to 200 basis points only to be walked back down by disa ppointing data in subsequent months.  There is less ambiguity with credit markets,  which continue to perform well.  Spreads have continued to narrow even as they ha ve approached 1998 levels.  Optimists point to improving credit quality, a global recove ry that will lift all boats, and anecdotal reports of less leverage in th e system.  Cynics counter that  there is too much investor confidence and hence complacency, given th e small room for error, and that the recovery is no sure thing—e specially for more-leveraged companies and weaker emerging-market borrowers.    The two middle panels reflect the conti nued contraction of risk spreads.  The investment-grade corporate spread narro wed to less than 100 basis points—the narrowest level since July 1998 and down from  265 basis points during the distress of early October last year.  The middle right panel depicts the Merrill Lynch high-yield and EMBI+ spreads to Treasuries.  At 425 basi s points, the high-yield spread is at its lowest level since August 1998, just before th e Russian default.  The combination of low Treasury yields and narrow spreads has led to the lowest no minal borrowing rates for lower-rated borrowers since before 1990, as  shown in the graph at the bottom of page 2.    While equities and fixed-income markets ha ve performed well th is year, the dollar has continued its steady deprec iation.  The chart at the t op of page 3 shows the value of the dollar against five ma jor currencies from January 1, 2003, to date. The pace of December 9, 20034 of 133depreciation has accelerated somewhat since ea rly September.  Part of the explanation is purported to be the G-7 communiqué in Dubai.  But the dollar has continued to depreciate despite all the positive data of the last 2½ months.  The dollar is at its weakest point against the eu ro since the euro ’s inception—at about 1.2260 as we speak.  The British pound recently hit an eleven-year high versus the dollar, and other floating currencies have also hit multiyear highs.  Part of the reason ascribed to the dollar’s fall relates to redu ced long-term private capital flows such as FDI or long-term equity investments.  Instead, the funding for the current account deficit relies more on short-term capital flows such as  official purchases.  Excluding Japan and Switzerland, dollar interest rates are lower than those of most major currencies across the yield curve.  The middle panel sh ows the yield advantage that five-year government bonds of Germany, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Australia have over the five-year Treasury.  The picture looks similar at other maturities.  With lower interest rates and an absence of long-term  capital flows, what appears to be giving way is the value of the dollar.  So far, the dollar’s fall has been gradual, and volatilities have been low.  The bottom pa nel shows implied volatilities for the euro–dollar and dollar–yen exchange rates.  Ther e has been little movement in euro–dollar volatility despite the move to successive new highs for the euro.  This suggests some comfort with the direction a nd pace of euro appreciation.  The implied volatility for the dollar–yen has continued to decline following its mid-September spike surrounding the G-7 summit in Dubai and the temporary intervention pause of Japan’s Ministry of Finance.  During the intermeeting period, the Japanese monetary authorities purchased anot her $17½ billion, bringing cu mulative purchases for 2003 to $157 billion.  Moving on to page 4 and activity in the System Open Market Account (SOMA), tomorrow will mark something of a milestone .  Fannie Mae’s ten-year bond that was issued on December 10, 1993, will mature, and that is the last agency instrument held outright in SOMA.  The top panel graphs the evolution of SOMA’s outright holdings of agencies going back to 1970.  At its pea k, SOMA held about $9 billion dollars of agency debt, accounting for about 6 to 7 pe rcent of SOMA’s holdings.  That number shrank rapidly in absolute size and as a percentage of overall SOMA holdings with the decision in 1981 to cease out right purchases and to roll over maturing securities only when suitable new securities were available in the primary market.  With the maturity of the Fannie Mae issue tomorrow, our outright agency holdings will be zero.  The Desk does continue to accept ag ency debt as collateral in its repo operations, as shown in the bottom panel.  Until the late 1990s the amount of agency collateral held was small, though as a percentage even that small number accounted for 10 to 30 percent of our collateral.  That  number shot higher in  the late 1990s with the shrinkage of the Treasury market and the run-up to Y2K.  In addition, the Desk also started to accept agency-sponsored mort gage-backed securities in late 1999, as shown by the green bars of the lower panel.   The absolute level of our collateral comprised by agencies, including mortgage-backed  securities, has declined in the past two years.  As a percent of the overall co llateral pool, the number s are back to the high end of their historical range.  December 9, 20035 of 133Mr. Chairman, There were no foreign operations.  I will need a vote to approve domestic operations.  CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  The domestic credit markets have been rather tranquil despite what is presumed to be a significant shif t in the propensity of foreign holders to purchase U.S. assets.  I assume that implies either that markets saw rates going down and have been supportive of that or that the sensitivity of market  interest rates to the substitution of official for private purchases is really quite small.  If the latter is the case, the notion that the official purchases had to be there to fill in the gap is in  a sense really missing the point.  Which of these two explanations, or a third if  you have one, would seem most credible in this context? MR. KOS.  I’m not sure that I have a third.  Th e way I would tend to look at it is that, to some degree, official holdings have had to fill in the gap to the extent that officials elsewhere have made a policy choice not to let their currencies  appreciate.  Now, exactly how that relates to the substitutability of domestic assets— CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  That ’s the crucial question. MR. KOS.  Yes, and that’s the unknown.  I don’ t have a way of quantifying that.  I agree with you that it is the crucial ques tion, but all we can see is the end result.  Exactly how we got there is the more difficult ques tion, and I’m not sure I can give  you an answer that would be robust and would make sense in a full-scale econometric model. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Furt her questions for Dino?   MR. FERGUSON.  May I ask one? CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Sure. MR. FERGUSON.  We had a brief discussion yesterday at our Boar d meeting about the equity risk premium.

Mr. Chairman, I have a question and a comment.   CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Certainly.  MR.  POOLE.  I didn’t see a reference in the memo to a warehousing limit, but maybe I missed it.  Is there a dollar limit on warehousing that this Committee votes on?  MR. KOS.  There is a $5 billion warehousing limit, which is a part of the package of authorizations and instructions under which we operate.  That limit was mentioned in the memo. MR. POOLE.  That’s in there.  So there’s a $5 billion limit? MR. KOS.  That’s right.  The Committee voted to revert to a limit of $5 billion in 1997 after it had been raised from $5 billion to $20 billion in 1995 to facilitate U.S. participation in the program to aid Mexico.   MR. POOLE.  If I may, Mr. Chairman, talk just a little about that?  CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Certainly.  January 27-28, 20045 of 238MR. POOLE.  I spent a lot of time digging into the history of this, reading the memorand ums of discussion from the early 1960s and the transcript—I think from 1990—when warehousing was discussed at length by the Committee.  I want to discuss the wisdom of our having that warehousing authority.  If we look at the domestic portfolio, the Federal Reserve Act prohibits the Federal Reserve from buying obligations directly from the Treasury, though there is a $3 billion emergency line, if you will, that the Treasury can call on to sell obligations direct ly to us.  And I think that that’s a sound provision.  We do not have an obligation to buy—and in fact, we cannot under the Federal Reserve Act—unlimited amounts from the Treasury.   The problem on the warehousing side—given the history on this and given th at the Treasury clearly has the lead responsibility on international issues—is that, when the Treasury comes to us and says it wants another $5 billion, we can find ourselves in a box under present circumstances.  I think it puts us in a very awkward position. In my view there’s something to be said for making the warehousing limit $3 billion, which would correspond to the $3 billion emergency amount available on the domestic side.  I think that would send the right message—that the Treasury does not have an unlimited line on the Federal Reserve.  My goal would be to try to prevent our being in the situation where, because the Treasury takes the lead on the international side, somehow the view is that we’re supposed to ante up whenever the Treasury asks us to.  That’s the awkwardness that I see in this situation.  CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Yes, there are a number of awkward relationships that we have in our role as fiscal agent, none of which to my knowledge has ever triggered any event that would be of concern to us.  I would assume that we could batten down a lot of different holes here and there.  I’m not certain that that would serve a useful purpose.  But that’s a judgment of January 27-28, 20046 of 238"
69,20040316,"subsequent revisions—since the first report is  the number the mark et responded to.  In any case, the focus on the employment data has been intense.  Although a lagging indicator, market participants are looking to the labor report to confirm other data that have already turned and thereby confirm th at the recovery has durability.  Treasury yields have been edging lo wer since January and declin ed sharply on March 5 after the latest employment report.  This morning the ten-year note was yielding about 3¾ percent.  Besides reacting to the empl oyment report and other data, the Treasury market has continued to be preoccupied with  the impact on Treasury yields of central bank buying.  The Bluebook has a boxed sect ion on page 2 examining this issue.  The middle panel on the first page of my  handout graphs the ten-year note yield on the left scale and the aggregate amount of Treasury securities held in custody by the New York Fed on the right scale for th e period starting in January 2003.  From January 2003 to November 2003, foreign cent ral bank holdings of Treasuries steadily grew from $700 billion to about $800 bill ion. The ten-year yield traversed a wide range from about 3.10 percent during late spring to a high of about 4.60 percent and by November 2004 yielded 4¼ percent.  Since November Treasury holdings have gone up another $100 billion or so, and yields  on the ten-year note have declined about 50 basis points.  But the direct quant itative links between the two variables are hard to find.  In part the reason may be th at we cannot gauge the direct impact of the purchases because, as with sterilized foreign exchange intervention, we don’t know the counterfactual.  But certain other factors cannot be ignored when assigning relative weights for why yields are at their current levels.  First, as noted earlier, the data have been disappointing.  Second, earlier comments by Committee members that short-term rates would stay low have affected  the shape of the curve.  And third, there is the possibility that so me convexity-related purchases among MBS investors have also kicked in, though anecdotal reports suggest that these hedging programs have had only a limited impact so far.  Although the yield curve has flat tened a bit in the past few weeks, it is still very steep by historical standards. The bottom pa nel graphs the spreads of the ten-year note less the three-month bill since 1990.  Some  investors believe that yields should be much higher at the long end of the cu rve, but they are ba ttling a countervailing force that should not be underestimated—na mely, the very attr active yield pickup between the financing rate and the return on longer-term securities. That dynamic has the capacity to keep bringing new investors into the trade for as long as investors believe financing rates will stay low.  Turning to page 2, breakeven rates on TI PS were rising—especially for the five-year maturity—until very recently when nominal rates moved lower and reduced the breakeven point.  One interesting character istic of recent price action has been the convergence of the five- and ten-year breakev en rates.  What is unclear is whether this reflects a change in the inflation outl ook for the second five years in that time span or whether it reflects technical reasons related to recent increases in the CPI that have had a greater impact on the value of the five-year maturity.  March 16, 20044 of 107The middle left panel graphs the investme nt-grade spread, while the middle right panel graphs the high-yield and EMBI+ sp reads and the Brazilian component of the EMBI.  All of those spreads widened after the last FOMC meeti ng and the change in wording in the Committee’s post-meeting statem ent.  In Brazil, local events affected spreads as well as the fact that Brazilian  paper is often used as a proxy hedge for other less liquid securities.  These spread s may suggest the beginnings of a risk-reduction phase in markets.  To some exte nt this widening was long awaited given the concerns that had been expressed for mont hs about the underpricing of risk in these segments.  Other price movements sugges ting the onset of a risk-reducing phase include the decline of equity prices.  A lthough all of the equity  indexes started the year strong, the weakness in the past few weeks has now put all of the major U.S. indexes into negative territory for the year to date.   The pattern in European markets has larg ely paralleled events in the United States, though not always for the same r easons.  As shown in the bottom panel, expected short-term interest rates have been falling in Eu rope as well.  In part the economic data did not come out as strong as the markets had hoped.  But perhaps the more important factor—until very recently—has been the strength of the euro.  With the euro’s appreciation in December and Janua ry, the markets came to believe that the ECB would ease policy to counteract the curren cy’s strength.  However, with the very recent depreciation of the euro from $1.29 to about $1.2350, some of the pressure was taken off, and the ECB kept rates steady at its last meeting. Nevertheless, the markets still seem to place fairly high odds that the next move could be an easing one.  The exchange value of the dollar has pr eoccupied both foreign and domestic asset markets.  The dollar had been falling agai nst most currencies into February, but it then rebounded sharply, as shown in the top panel on page 3.  The reasons for the rebound seem to lie as much in the real m of technical analysis and position adjustments as in any interpretation of th e fundamentals.  Data on positions are hard to come by.  But one source that gives us  a glimpse is the commitment of traders report published by the IMM every week for currency futures market activity.  Although admittedly imperfect, it does offer one window into the activity of noncommercial users of futures. The bottom pa nel graphs for the euro and the yen the number of contracts held at  the end of each week since September 2003.  The recent shift from more than 50,000 long yen cont racts to about 10,000 short yen contracts represents the largest weekly shift in the hist ory of this time series.  During that week, there was nothing in the data th at could explain such a shift.   It may simply have been a case of the dollar having fallen too far too fast and a consolidation needing to take place.  A variation on this has a link to the risk-reduction story:  That is, if risk positions were being reduced, this would incl ude the closing out of some of the large short dollar positions that had been built up.  In any case, the longer-term forecast among Street economists is for the dollar to re sume its decline, so  the dollar’s recent rebound has not changed the underlying sentiment.   In part that reflects concerns about the current account, and in part, as shown in the two middle panels, it reflects interest rate differentials—except with the yen—that favor other currencies.   March 16, 20045 of 107The yen story, as usual, is a bit more complicated.  For once the recent data for Japan have been decidedly more bullish.  Fourth-quarter GDP growth, for example, was reported to be at a 7 pe rcent rate.  Adding in the Ja panese current account surplus and the inflows into Japanese equities from foreign investors, it’s not surprising to see the yen facing upward pressures.  The panel at the top of page 4 shows (in the red line) the depreciation of the dollar–yen ex change rate through mid-March.  The blue bars graph the daily interventions by the Ja panese monetary authorities.  As the dollar moved down, Japan intervened steadily and sometimes in massive size to smooth the fall of the dollar.  Market participants noted  a change once the dolla r began to rise.  It appeared that the Ministry of Finance (M OF) was actively seeking to push the dollar higher—in contrast to its pr evious action of smoothing out the decline as the dollar was falling.  The largest and most controve rsial intervention occu rred on March 5, the day of the employment report.  The middle panel graphs for that day the intraday evolution of exchange rates indexed from midnight eastern time for the yen, the euro, the Australian dollar, the Canadian dollar, and the pound sterling.  At 8:30 a.m., the weaker-than-expected employ ment report was released.  Yields and the dollar both fell sharply.  The exception was the dollar–ye n exchange rate, which disengaged from other currency rates and act ually rose.  The MOF bought $11 billion dollars in the hours after the data release and, in effect , pushed the rate in the opposite direction than that suggested by that new piece of fundamental information.  Market participants were confused by the price action, which thre w some of the cross rates out of alignment and adversely affected liqui dity.  We’ve heard anecdotal reports that speculators have reduced their activity in the dollar–yen currency pair—reports corroborated by data from the major interd ealer brokers indicati ng that activity in dollar–yen has been flat or going down in recent quarters.  The dollar–yen rate fell again late yesterday and this morning follo wing Japanese newswire reports that the Japanese authorities would cease large-scale intervention after the end of the fiscal year.  This morning the dollar was down about 1 yen, at 109.35.  During the intermeeting period Japan bought—incl uding overnight purchases—$76 billion, bringing to $138 billion its purchases in the fi rst two and a half months of the year.  For comparison’s sake, during a very busy 2003, Japan bought $180 billion over the entire twelve-month span.  Leaving aside the trials and tribulations of the exchange markets, other Japanese asset markets appear unfazed by the scale of the intervention.  As seen at the bottom left, equity prices in Japan rose, in cont rast to the pullbacks in U.S. and European equity markets.  Bank stocks have continued to rally as they have since the bailout of Resona in May.  The recent IPO of Shinsei was in demand, and with GDP forecasts generally being raised, the bad debt situation is expected to improve somewhat.  Though at one point there was a sharp sello ff in the Japanese government bond (JGB) market, perhaps the most surprising thing about that market is how well it has performed.  Ten-year yields still trade near 1.3 percent despite the better economic numbers.  Although there has been chatter about the Bank of Japan’s having to plan for an exit strategy from its very accommodative stance, most JGB investors still seem to think that is a long way off.

Two factors contributed to th e success of the experiment.  One was contracting for an outside professional to help provide a typed transcri pt of the meeting on an expedited basis.  That sped up the process of preparing the initial draft of the minutes considerab ly.  For another, there weren’t all that many comments on that first draft, so we were able to inco rporate them and turn out a revised draft in fairly good order.  One problem, which we had anticipated, was getting information to and from Committee members who were out of thei r offices.  Needle ss to say, we learned a few things about the pro cess, and we will make some mino r adjustments, but they will be in the background from your perspective. Once the minutes were ready, we asked Dave Skidmore of the Public Affairs staff to prepare some hypothetical headlines and the first few paragr aphs of a news wire stor y on the minutes.  Then Board and New York staff members independently look ed at that information as well as the minutes and tried to estimate the likely market effects of an early re lease of those minu tes.  The results, which should be taken with a grain of salt, suggested  that there could have b een a fairly substantial market reaction, and that was because of the timi ng.  These minutes would have been released on the afternoon of the outsized employment report, and perhaps would have reinforced the market reaction to the numbers released earlier that day. I’m sure you noted that in this  exercise we asked you to indicate whether you were inclined to vote to approve these minutes but not actually to  vote on them.  The reason was that if we had asked you to vote, we would have  to indicate in the next set of minutes that the Committee had taken a notation vote on that d ecision.  That’s why tw o and a half weeks af ter the meeting we’ll May 4, 20044 of 1121 The materials used by Mr. Kos are appended to this transcript (appendix 1). continue to ask you to give us your inclination as to whether you would approve the draft minutes but actually have you vote on them at the next mee ting.  Thank you. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Any questions for Vincent? MR. POOLE.  Mr. Chairman, may I ask a question?  It seems to me that we ought to consult with counsel as to whether the so-called inclination to vote c ould be regarded as being the equivalent of a vote and could create a problem in the future.  I think that’s something on which we should get some expert legal advice. MR. REINHART.  We did. MR. POOLE.  Okay.  So it’s perf ectly okay to put it that way? MR. REINHART.  Virgil  thought that the wording of the request we sent around was perfectly appropriate. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Presid ent Geithner is proposing th e election of Joseph Tracy as an associate economist of the FOMC.  If there are no objections , I will assume that his request is approved. VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  Thank you. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Dino Ko s, would you start us off? MR. KOS.1  Yes.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I’ll be referring to the charts that Carol Low just circulated.  In the inte rmeeting period, stronger economic data and rapidly shifting expectations brought forward the timing of the anticipated tightening cycle and affected a range of asset prices.  The top panel of page  1 graphs the three-month deposit rate in black and the three-month deposit rate three, six, and nine months forward in the dashed red lines.  The first move up in forward rates followed the strong employment report on April 2.  Th e second move was coincident with the higher-than-expected CPI data on April 14, c oupled with other i ndicators suggesting to market participants that inflationary pr essures were building.  Also contributing to the shift were comments by the Chairman and other members of the Committee—and even a former member of the Committee—th at were broadly interpreted as laying the groundwork for a tightening later this su mmer.  During April, the three-month forward rate moved about 35 basis points  higher, whereas the nine-month forward May 4, 20045 of 112rate moved up about 100 basis points.  Not surprisingly, the Treasury curve sold off, and yields moved sharply higher as well.  The two-year yield, which tends to be the most sensitive to policy changes, rose a bout 82 basis points between late March and this morning.  As shown in the middle pane l, the spread between  the two-year note and the target fed funds rate widened to 130 basis points, its wi dest level since the spring of 2002.  Just as a footnote, I would point out that there has been  a lot of talk about what would happen to bond yields if the fed funds target were raised.  What perhaps has been lost in the discussion is just how much  yields already have risen in only the last five weeks with the mere discussion of a possible tightening.  The bottom left panel graphs the two-year to ten-ye ar Treasury spread.  If the market were truly worried about inflationary pressures, one would expect the curve to steepen as the long end rises faster than the short end.  But the spread has not widened and in fact has narrowed somewhat—especially after the Chairman’s testimony.  Similarly, breakeven rates from TIPS have not widened and have also narrowed slightly in the past two weeks.  The market is certainly discounting higher interest rates; it is not obvious, however, that higher inflat ion is also being priced in.  The churning of positions and hedging adjustments as new data came in did cause a bit of congestion in segments of the market.  Turning to page 2, the top panel graphs the overnight repo rate for the on-the-run tw o-year Treasury note since February.  The Treasury Department auctions two-year not es monthly so this graph picks up each new issue on settlement.  It’s typical for th e on-the-run two-year note to trade slightly “special”—translating into an overnight financing rate a bit below the general collateral rate, which itself is normally a few basis points below the funds rate.  After the last employment report, the market rushed  to sell the curve, es pecially at the short end.  In that situation, those with short positions then need to borrow the security to complete settlement.  Given the size of the short base, the demand to borrow that piece of paper quickly pushed the financing rate toward zero.  The congestion also caused a rise in fails for this issue, and to a lesser extent some other on-the-run issues, though aggregate fails are still significantly  below where they were last summer, when the May ten-year note was in short supp ly.  The increase in the repo rate at the very end of April is due to the issuance of a new two-year  note that is trading more comfortably nearer to the general collateral rate.  The mortgage market provided another el ement to recent price changes.  The middle left panel graphs the ten-year yield in red and an estimate of the duration of outstanding thirty-year fixed-ra te mortgage-backed securities (MBS) in blue.  With the ten-year yield going from 3.75 to 4.5 percent, the MBS duration index nearly doubled from two years to more than three and a half years.  There was certainly some MBS convexity hedging, but  it probably played a lesse r role than it did last summer when duration widened very rapidly from about one-half year to three and a half years.  The thirty-year MBS spr ead, shown on the middle right panel, has widened in recent weeks, but it is still a long way from the highs of last summer.  May 4, 20046 of 112"
71,20040630,"1 The materials used by Ms. Johnson and Mr. Gagnon are appended to this transcript (appendix 1). MR. FERGUSON.  I move approval. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Approved withou t objection.  We will now move to the special presentation on prospective external  adjustments, and I call on Karen Johnson. MS. JOHNSON.1  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. You should have a packet of charts labeled “U.S. External Adjustment” in front of you.  Our topic toda y is U.S. external adjustment.  The “adjustment” that is our focus starts with the recognition that the United States is running a larg e and growing deficit vis-à-vis the rest of the world in the use of goods and services—a deficit that makes obvious our interdependency with foreign economic behavior.  As a result, some  analysts are concerned that a change in foreign behavior at some point may have unwelcome consequences for us.  But in today’s interdependent global economy, such vulnerability is present even for those in external balance or surplus.  In our pres entation today, we will analyze the factors behind our growing external deficit and cons ider what circumstances might foster its reversal.  Of particular concern will be the implications of various alternatives for U.S. asset prices, especially the foreig n exchange value of the dollar.   One direct measure of our external deficit (s hown in the top panel) is the balance of payments concept termed the “current account bala nce”—that is, the sum of the trade balance, net investment income, and net fore ign transfers.  For many years the U.S. current account balance has been  driven for the most part by  the trade balance.  Both balances began a period of substantial decline in 1996 that was only briefly interrupted by the recession in 2001.   The price-adjusted exchange value of the dol lar in terms of the currencies of a large number of our trading partners (the dotted blue line) is central to our story for two reasons.  First, th e dollar exchange rate is an important price variable in most, if not all, of the significant demand-and-supply relations hips in our complex story.  Second, the dollar exchange rate is part of the transmis sion mechanism of U.S. monetary policy and influences U.S. inflation determination.  Note  that the dollar began to appreciate from a low point in early 1995—in advance of the downturn in the trade balance—and generally continued to rise until early 2002.  The nominal exchange value of the dollar in terms of the major foreig n currencies (the green line in the middle left panel) has come even further off its 2002 peak than ha s the more inclusive broad real dollar, nearly returning to its 1995 level.  This difference reflects the fact that, in terms of the currencies of our other important trading partners (the dashed red line), the dollar has risen somewhat in nominal terms since earl y 2002.  The dollar ex change rates of the major currencies have tended to  be more flexible and more market driven than some of the OITP currencies, such as the Chinese renminbi; an d the dollar has appreciated against some of these other currencies, in particular the Mexican peso.  Persistent current account deficits cumula te to the net intern ational investment position, shown to the right, which measures  our growing stock of indebtedness to the June 29-30, 20044 of 203rest of the world.  Th is large and growing st ock of claims on the United States must be held at all times, an d one intuitive perspect ive on the sustainabi lity of our external position is that this stock cannot increase rela tive to our GDP foreve r.  Every import and export transaction in the current account has a financial counterpart.  Except for measurement error, the current account balanc e equals the net of all the international financial transactions.  There are, of course, huge volum es of cross-border transactions between assets—unrelated to trade finance and driven by complex incentives of risk and return—that have consequences for asset prices , including exchange rates.  Recent data for elements of those financial flows, reported in the bottom le ft panel, show that private foreign inflows to purcha se U.S. securities (line 3) are very large, pa rticularly in relation to private U.S. outflows to purchase foreign securities (line 4) and net direct investment (line 5).  Moreover, these flow s increased sharply in the fi rst quarter.  Nevertheless, foreign official inflows (lin e 2), which had about doubled in 2003, rose significantly further earlier this year.  From a macroeconomic perspective and with the public and private sectors combined, the extent to  which the United States invests more than it saves corresponds to resources borrowed from abroad—the bl ue shaded region la beled “net foreign lending” in the bottom right panel.  This is the NIPA analogue to the current account balance.  As the rise in U.S. net dome stic investment in the 1990s outpaced that in net saving, our external deficit rose.  As our saving subsequently declined sharply, the external deficit widened further.  Unless and until the trade bala nce begins to narr ow, adjustment is not yet occurring.  Indeed, as was argued in the background paper circulated to the Co mmittee, stability in the ratio of our foreign indebtedness to nom inal GDP requires that the trade deficit eventually return to near zer o.  U.S. trade data are pres ented at the to p of your next exhibit.  The yellow shaded area represents the trade deficit, which has reached a record level.  To the right of the ver tical line, which is positioned at the latest actual  data point, we have shown a simple extra polation of imports and exports—based on standard partial equilibrium trade equations—fo r the case in whic h real GDP here an d abroad grows at potential and the real value of  the dollar remains at its current level.  With imports already substantially larger than exports an d with foreign potentia l growth reasonably robust but slightly less than U.S. potential growth, the change in imports tends to exceed that in exports, and so in this  case there is no adjustment through 2010.  The green bars measure the change in the trad e balance.  For the trade bala nce to narrow significantly, exports would need to grow rapidly relative to import growth for an extended period.  The middle panel provides a summary of the composit ion and magnitude of cross-border financial flows for the same period, expressed as a percen t of GDP.  The trade balance above accounts for most of the change in the current account balance, shown in yellow.  U.S. private financia l outflows, in tan, also must  be financed; and the sum of these two is the counterpart to foreign private financial inflows (in blue) plus net official flows (in red).  The extrapolation through 20 10 incorporates the tr ade outcome from the top panel and plausible staff projections of U. S. and foreign private financial flows.  Of course, private flows could behave differently,  depending on the incentives perceived by June 29-30, 20045 of 203investors here and abroad.  To the extent that the flows shown in  blue do not fully finance the current account deficit plus U.S. private outflows, foreign official intervention may fill the remaining gap, as shown here.  Otherwise, exchange rates, other prices, and incomes here and abroad wo uld change, resulting in a current account position and private flows that would sa tisfy the balance of  payments norms.  The bottom two panels provide some detail on recent stocks of dollar holdings by foreign officials (the left panel) and foreign private investors (the right panel) that correspond to the flows in the middle panel.   Estimates based on  data through April show that, of the total foreig n official holdings of more than $1,600 billion (line 1), about two-thirds consist of Tr easury securities (line 2).  The end of 2001 was very near the time of the most recent pe ak in the value of the dollar.   Changes from then through April are shown in the column to the right and reveal that the change in the total is nearly accounted for by the ch ange in holdings of “selected” Asia (line 3)—economies whose monetary authorities have engaged in substantial foreign exch ange intervention.  The incentives behind dollar ac quisition by foreign officials, for the most part, relate to their objectives for their re spective exchange rates and th e competitiveness of their exports.   Foreign private holdings are si gnificantly in fixed-income  securities—lines 1, 2, and 3 in the right panel.  These investors are thus  exposed to dollar exchange rate risk and to U.S. market interest ra te risk.  Foreign holding s of U.S. equity (line 4) are also large but entail somewhat different risk s.  Over the period since th e dollar began its appreciation in 1995, foreign investors have more than doubled their holdings of each of these categories of assets.  Nevertheless, because U.S. securities market s are very large and quite liquid, changes in preferences on th e part of foreign in vestors among these categories of assets need not ha ve major implications  for their prices.  However, as long as the U.S. current account re mains in deficit, ne t foreign claims on U.S. assets must continue to rise in total.  Any diminution in the appetite of inve stors for U.S. assets would first trigger valuation ch anges, primarily via the exchange rate, that would lower the foreign-currency denominated value of th eir total claims on the United States.   Such a change in investor appetite could well be the first step  in the external adjustment process.  So me characteristics of an “orderly ” adjustment are listed in the top left panel of your next exhibit.  Although there are a great many possible alternative paths for adjustment that could be termed “o rderly,” in the sense that financial markets would continue to function within normal rang es, such an outcome seems more likely to occur if investors are attracted by improved returns abroad rather than discouraged by unfavorable changes in U.S. prospects.  Vari ous specifics along thes e paths would differ, but all would be characterized by continued, albeit declining, net financial inflows into the U.S. economy.  In addition, because la sting correction of the U.S. external defi cit cannot be achieved thro ugh cyclical slowing of  U.S. GDP growth to  below potential and the associated temporary restraint on import s, external adjustment such that exports increase more than impo rts almost certain ly requires dollar depreciation.

72,20040810,"of the ten-year note, the yi eld curve has continued to fl atten, as shown in the bottom panel.  Several weeks ago bond traders were worried  that the sharp rise in bond yields might set off a wave of selling by MBS i nvestors facing extension risk.  With the move down in yields those worries have reversed.  The top left panel on page 2 graphs the duration of the thirty-year MBS index, which has narrowed sharply since early June and now stands at just above 3½ years.  On Friday alone that index contracted by about six months.  The level of MBS-related buying in recent days is hard to track, but anecdotally it has not been  a prominent feature of recent trading.  A further move in the MBS yield toward 4 percent could trigger hedge-related buying by accounts positioning for a new wave of refinancing.  As shown in the top right panel, the spread between MBS and Treasuries has narrowed from 55 basis points in early June to  about 40 basis points.   Part of that outperformance by MBS is probably due to a reach for yield in an environment where the market believed it had comfort about the pace of tightening going forward.  An alternative way of looking at MBS spreads is to measure the level of the implied volatility of the embedded option.  With vol atilities generally low across a range of securities and instruments, the value of the short opti on embedded in MBS is worth less, and the MBS itself becomes worth mo re. That vols in MBS are low is a bit puzzling given the shortening of duration, which increases the likelihood that the options will move into the money.  A side eff ect of this narrowing of  spreads is that at least one housing GSE has already signaled that it will scale back MBS purchases, given the reduced value it per ceives in current spreads.   Other credit markets performed well.  Spr eads on investment-grade corporate debt were little changed and appeared nonplusse d by the June tightening, as shown in the middle left panel.  Swap spreads were also little changed.  Th e high-yield market—shown in the middle right panel—performed well in the aftermath of the tightening but widened more recently as the equity markets sold off.  Interestingly, spreads on emerging-market bonds—where there had been  perhaps the most anxiety about the tightening cycle—also narrowed slightly.  Ironically, the equity markets hit their recent peaks just about the time of the Committee’s last meeting and have struggled since, as shown in the bottom panel.  Th e list of reported ailments for equities is lengthy:  oil prices approaching $45, weaker macro data, terror alerts, and earnings outlooks for the next few quarters that are far less favorable than the generally strong Q2 results.  According to several equity  strategists, operating earnings growth probably peaked in Q2 and is expected to  decelerate in coming quarters.  Given higher oil prices and higher short-term inte rest rates, the recent sluggishness in equity prices becomes perhaps a bit more understandable.   The picture of moderating economic outl ooks and range-bound markets is visible overseas as well.  The top panel on page 3 graphs the euro area three-month deposit rate and the three-month rates three, six, a nd nine months forward.  Forward rates had generally fluctuated in a well-defined range, and the ECB was thought to be on hold August 10, 20044 of 103for the rest of the year.  But forward rate s fell in the last two weeks as the weaker U.S. data and continued sluggish data in core  Europe took a toll.  By late last week even the modest tightening for early ne xt year began to be priced out.   The euro has traded mostly in a 1.20 to  1.24 range for the past three months, though it appreciated sharply on Friday after the employment report. The dollar–yen exchange rate has been similarly in a range buffeted by events on both sides of the Pacific.  Through the middle of June the yen (in the middle right panel) and JGB yields (in the bottom left pa nel) both had upward pressure  coincident with several months of strong Japanese data, improved business sentiment, a movement by some price indexes away from deflation, and ge nerally increased optimism from investors that the long period of economic underperfo rmance in Japan was at an end.  Since mid-June, however, the value of the yen, JGB yields, and Japanese stock prices have all fallen, as investors have tempered thei r optimism with the latest batch of macro numbers.  Those numbers have been almo st uniformly weaker than investors’ expectations and have caused some reassessment of how strong the Japanese recovery really is.   Let me change gears just a bit.  In th e past several months , quite a few traders have bemoaned the low level of volatility  across a range of asset markets and the absence of perceived trading opportunities .  Indeed, according to public reports by consultants who track the performance of hedge funds, the last few months have been difficult ones.  Page 4 graphs the option- implied volatility since 1999 for a sampling of the major asset markets.  The top pane l graphs the S&P 500 volatility index; the major dollar currency pairs are in the middl e panel; and two- and ten-year swaptions are shown in the bottom panel.  In general, implied volatility has been toward the low end of historical averages for these asse ts, but a quick look at other markets not shown here suggests that vola tility is low in markets as diverse as the Mexican peso and the Korean stock market.    Given the list of potential worries out there, including the upcoming election, high and rising oil prices, terroris t threats and other geopolitic al issues, the onset of a tightening cycle, and the usual concerns about the durability of  the recovery, one could reasonably make the case that vols are on the low side.  Since options are a form of financial insurance, one explanati on could be that inve stors are shrugging off the list of possible concerns  and that there’s no apparent  mispricing of assets that investors want to protect against.  A more  intriguing explanation some have offered centers on the supply side of the volatility market and part icularly on the behavior of the speculative community.  This explanation posits that, with  the flood of money moving into hedge funds recently, the best tr ade ideas have been picked over pretty well.  But the pressure  to make absolute returns persis ts; and the suggestion is that, in lieu of adding to traditional carry trades, hedge funds have been selling options to generate premium.  That flow of selli ng is in turn putting downward pressure on volatilities in a range of markets.    August 10, 20045 of 103As long as volatilities stay low, that is a winning strategy.  If volatilities should rise, then those with short vol positions would have to rush to cover their positions.  Data limitations do not allow this explanati on to be validated, but the possibility of large short vol positions spread out over  many institutions cannot be ruled out.  Finally, note that selling volatility is in eff ect very similar to a traditional carry trade: both need stability of prices or  rates or both in order to wor k.  If this strategy is being used in size, then our traditional measures of the size of the carry trade would be underestimated.   Mr. Chairman, there were no foreign operations in this period.  I will need a vote to approve domestic operations.  CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Is it possible that the presumption in th e market that the federal funds rate will foll ow a certain pattern—prior , let’s say, to the mark et’s move la st Friday after the employment report —has created an anchor to the structur e of rates that, by its very nature, delimits the extent of vol atility?  That could be an explanation of the low volatility.  The issue really gets down to whether the ma rket believes that is exac tly what is going to happ en and it is taking that presumed pattern for the funds rate  as a given.  And they believe that because we’re telling them that.  That automatically will lower the volatility, which raises another obvious problem—that the system is less resilient to shocks  from unexpected events.  That makes me a little  nervous if that is indeed the explanation.  Second, on the issue of potential endeavors to adjust durati on in the mortgage market, I have the impression that the last big waves of refinancin g took out a very big chu nk of moderate interest coupon mortgages.  While it may very well be true that, when interest rates fall or du ration falls back, there would be inclinations to hedge—essentia lly buy fixed-rate mortga ges.  But if you clean out the whole base, there’s nothin g left.  There’s a very delimite d amount of potential hedging activity that becomes required, exce pt for the idiosyncratic shift in duration that has nothing to do with refinancings.  This  is not a convexity issu e so much; it’s more an endeavor to judge where there is potential for re financing.  Do we have  a judgment on this?  August 10, 20046 of 103"
73,20040921,"cycles—for 1994, the mini-cycle of 1997, 1999, and 2004.  I did not include earlier cycles given the different policy and operating environment prior to 1994.  As this graphs shows, the red line depicting 2004 stands out in that yields have fallen.  We see the same pattern for ten-year yields in the middle panel.  Finally, the bottom panel graphs the change in the swap spread also on the same basis.  This last item has more variability, but again this cycle stands out in that spreads have actually narrowed since the beginning of the tightening cycle.  Admittedly this is a limited sample, and one can argue whether 1997 should even be included, but it is notable in any case that the market’s reaction has progressively become more benign as the Committee has become more transparent and the communications policy has evolved.  Moving to page 3, breakeven rates on TIPS have narrowed and that fall even accelerated as the price of oil again headed higher in recent weeks.  Whereas earlier this year the correlation between TIPS breakevens and oil price changes was positive, it has now turned negative—again suggesting that the economic tax of higher oil prices is viewed as a more powerful force than its inflationary impact.  The middle panels graph corporate and emerging-market spreads, which continued to narrow.  Corporate issuance was on the low side, while investors’ search for yield continued.  And after a soggy July, equity prices have risen since your last meeting despite some downbeat corporate outlooks, the summer slowdown in retail sales, and a buildup of inventories in parts of the tech sector.  Extending this favorable picture is the continuing low volatility in many markets.  Page 4 graphs the implied volatility for the S&P 500, the major currency pairs, and representative swaption contracts.  These are similar to graphs I presented at the last meeting, so I won’t go through them in any detail but only to note that implied volatilities remain low and in some cases are going still lower.  The VIX equity implied volatility index is at about 14 percent, its lowest level in about a decade.  This combination of low volatility, narrow spreads, stable or rising equity prices, and lower yields, even in the face of tightening monetary policy, is about as benign an environment as one can imagine.  What is unclear is whether this happy set of conditions will persist or whether this is the calm before the storm.  One market that did see a bit of volatility during the intermeeting period was the fed funds market.  After my June briefing, when I described how the fed funds market had become less volatile, this is a development I should have anticipated!  [Laughter] Ironically probably the main reason for the volatility around the time of the last Committee meeting is the transparency of monetary policy and the confidence this gives reserve managers at banks to buy reserves to meet requirements before a well-anticipated rate increase.  I’d like to spend the rest of my briefing on this topic.  But let me step back a bit to summarize what we at the Desk do on a day-to-day basis.    Keeping the funds rate close to its target involves providing enough reserves over a maintenance period to allow banks to achieve two objectives.  First, the injected reserves should allow the banks to meet all their requirements as well as their September 21, 20044 of 100precautionary demands for excess reserves.  Second, the reserves need to be injected at a measured pace to avoid undue risks that some banks will end any day overdrawn or that some banks will accumulate so many reserves early in the maintenance period that they risk holding unwanted excess levels by the end of the period.  But managing reserves becomes more complicated when there is a great degree of certainty regarding changes to the target fed funds rate around FOMC meeting dates.  When the expectation of a potential rate hike becomes priced into the interest rate futures market, these expectations also begin to show through to the funds rate in the days of the maintenance period immediately prior to an FOMC meeting at which an increase in the policy rate is anticipated.  Reserve managers begin to shift their demand for balances to meet more of their reserve requirements ahead of the meeting, when rates are expected to be relatively cheap.  This reaction was exhibited during the reserve maintenance period leading up to the August 10 increase in the fed funds target, as shown in the shaded portion of the top panel on page 5.  That panel depicts the target funds rate in black and the effective rate in the horizontal red line, along with the highs and lows for each day.  With near certainty that the Committee would raise the target funds rate, the incentive for reserve managers was to accumulate reserves and bid up the funds rate.  The Desk sought to lean against those pressures by adding more reserves than is typical at that point in the reserve maintenance period.  The green line in the bottom panel graphs the average level of excess balances in that period compared with more-normal levels, the blue line.  Perhaps the funds rate would have been even firmer had we not added the extra reserves.  However, as we witnessed in that reserve maintenance period, there are tradeoffs in how the Desk reacts to a widely anticipated rate hike.  The added reserves may be of limited effectiveness if expectations are very firm.  And any buildup of high cumulative excess reserve balances in the banking system during the first half of the maintenance period will leave banks holding a much higher than normal level of reserves than they typically want at that stage in a period once the meeting date has passed.  That could possibly set up conditions in which downward pressure on rates would emerge—whether the funds target was raised at the meeting or not.   This risk materialized after the August meeting because the Desk did not feel that it had the scope to reduce cumulative excess positions following the meeting date.  Given the upcoming high payment flow day of the Treasury’s mid-quarter refunding settlement on August 16, to do so seemed likely to exacerbate the expected upward rate pressures anticipated on that day.  As we witnessed during this period, the high cumulative excess positions eventually led to very high levels of volatility.  The latter worked their way into trading as the end of the maintenance period approached, with trading well below the new target rate as well.  At the same time, it’s questionable what impact the high levels of excess reserves provided early in the period had in damping rate pressure before the change was announced.  Evidence suggests that that effect was only limited.    September 21, 20045 of 100As the Desk will continue to face these challenges in a rising interest rate environment, it may be prudent to battle firm trading conditions less aggressively prior to a widely anticipated hike in the funds rate.  While providing some level of reserves in excess of median levels in the midst of firm trading may be warranted, we are likely to be cautious in our provision, recognizing the risks that arise from high cumulative balances subsequent to the actual rate movement.  Mr. Chairman, there were no foreign exchange operations in the period.  I should note that tomorrow will mark four years since the last intervention by the U.S. monetary authorities.  This continues the longest period of non-intervention by the U.S. monetary authorities in the floating rate period.  I will need a vote to approve domestic operations.    CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Shouldn’t your next -to-last sentence be, “Noted and complimented”?  [Laughter]  Why do we bother intervening at all in the functioning of reserve markets a week or so before an FOMC meeting?  MR. KOS.  Well, that’s an excellent question.  The charge that I at least believe I have from this Committee is to achieve—  CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  That is readily changed.  [Laughter] MR. KOS.  Well, okay.  But in the regime under which we are now operating, as far as I’m aware I’m expected to try to achieve the target fed funds rate every day.  So despite the fact that the market is expecting a higher funds rate, until the Committee decides to raise its rate objective, we’re still working under the old directive.  CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  If I might say so, it sounds absurd on the surface, and it sounds absurd beneath the surface as well!  [Laughter]  MR. REINHART.  But, Mr. Chairman, the alternative would put Dino in the position of giving a signal of your action at the upcoming meeting.  CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  All he needs to do is to state what his intentions are in advance.  In other words, he can indicate that he will supply a certain amount of reserves over a September 21, 20046 of 100"
74,20041110,"The top panel on the first page graphs the three- month deposit rate in black and the rates three, six, and nine  months forward in red.  Forward rates sagged somewhat after the September employment report that was released on October 8.  However, forward rates began to rise again when oil prices began to fall from recent highs of $55 and then again after Friday ’s October employment report.  Two-year note yields, shown in the middle left panel, have risen  more than 35 basis points since the last meeting, with much of the increase coming in the past few days.  The longer end of the curve has not responded as much.  Ten- year yields, depicted in the middle right panel, rose about 20 basis points and have remained in the 4 to 4¼ percent range.  As a result, as shown in the bottom panel, the yield curve has continued to flatten, with the two -year to ten-year spread narrowing further since the September meeting.  Some in the market are interpreting this flattening as reassurance that inflationary concerns are contained.   Interestingly, despite the flattening of the curve, TIPS breakeven rates have widened since the September meeting.  As shown in the top left panel of the next page, ten -year breakeven rates widened about ¼ percentage point.  Part of the recent widening may have been due to the last CPI report, which rose 0.4 points.  TIPS, as you know, use the non-seasonally -adjusted consumer price index to determine inflation compensation.  That makes the latest widening a bit of a puzzle since the recent decline in oil prices may reasonably be expected to have a damping effect on upcoming CPI reports.  Indeed, to add to the puzzle, some have linked the recent widening of breakeven spreads to the recent fall in oil prices on the theory that this is stimulative to growth and later for inflation.   As depicted in the middle panel, spreads have continued to narrow.  The investment -grade  spread, in the middle left panel, is curre ntly at its lowest level since July 1998.  High- yield and emerging -market  spreads, shown in the middle right panel, are also at multiyear lows.  While some of the narrowing is, no doubt, the result of a search for yield by some investors, the strong cash positions of the corporate sector, the repair to balance sheets since the fall of 2002, and improved situations in some major emerging markets —especially Brazil —suggest that the move can ’t be categorized solely as a liquidity story.   Equity prices have risen in recent days but they are only slightly higher for the year, and implied volatilities are a bit higher but not materially so.   Changing gears a bit, right after the Committee ’s September meeting, OFHEO released its report on Fannie Mae’ s accounting met hodology.  At first, Fannie Mae ’s stock price fell about 15 percent and sharply underperformed both Freddie Mac ’s stock and the broader indexes .  Fannie ’s equity price has since regained about half its losses.  The effect  in spread markets, as shown in the  bottom right panel, was fleeting.  The green line graphs the spread of Fannie ’s senior ten -year debt to Treasuries, which widened about 10 basis points initially but has now retraced that move fully and is back to its mid -September level. The blue line gr aphs the spread to the ten -year swap rate, which is probably more meaningful to Fannie ’s funding and hedging costs.  That spread also widened slightly but has since retraced.   November 10, 20044 of 107Finally, let me say a few words about foreign exchange markets. The dollar conti nued to fall during the intermeeting period, though the reasons for its fall are less than clear. The top panel on page 3 graphs the dollar ’s movements against a select ed group of currencies indexed from September 1.  Despite some thought that the Japanese  authorities might begin intervening again, the dollar has fallen below 106 yen.  Meanwhile, the euro has risen to nearly $1.30 and was trading at $1.2975 earlier this morning.  These are the euro’ s highest levels since its launch.  The Canadian dollar is at its strongest level since 1992; the Swiss franc is at its highest level since 1996; and the British pound a week or two ago hit its highest level since the ERM crisis of 1992.  In recent weeks the market has focused its attention quite a bit more on the  current account deficit.  Indeed, some market commentators ascribed part of the dollar ’s fall to comments by several Committee members speaking about the size and implications of the current account deficit.  However, the deficit has been with us for a long time , and it is not clear why it should suddenly capture the market ’s imagination.  Other commentators focused more on what they saw as uncertainties about the growth outlook for the United States in 2005 or the possibility that the election would not have a clear winner.  And still others viewed the prospect of a Kerry victory as dollar negative.  In the event, of course, the election produced a quick winner.  Friday ’s employment data were far stronger than expected, and on Monday ECB President Trichet dabbled in a bit of verbal intervention when he labeled recent euro– dollar moves as “brutal” and “unwelcome.”  That the dollar was either sold off or at best held its ground after each of these events has added to the bearishness many traders now have toward the dollar in the near term.  Interestingly, some of the same people who previously believed a Kerry victory would be bearish because of trade concerns now see the Bush victory as bearish on the assertion that the budget situation will not be addressed.  Asian currencies also gathered more attention than usual in recent weeks.  The move by the People ’s Bank of China to increase interest rates by 27 basis points and remove the ceiling on bank lending rates was taken as a symbol of the authorities ’ determi nation to rein in growth.  Several commodity prices, especially metals prices, fell in the days after the decision, though the price of oil did not begin to ease until a week later.  Interestingly, some market participants viewed this interest rate move as  a signal that the authorities might be more willing to revalue the exchange rate. The middle panel graphs the yuan spot rate, which is fixed at 8.28 to the dollar, and the forward rates implied from one-, six-, and twelve -month nondeliverable forwards.  The forwards widened somewhat to a level seen earlier this year during another wave of speculation that a move might be at hand.  While China ’s exchange rate has stayed solidly fixed at 8.28, some of the other Asian countries have permitted some modest appr eciation of their currencies against the dollar.  The bottom panel on page 3 graphs the changes in six selected currencies since early August.  Although appreciations of between 2 and 5 percent may not seem like much, they have been noted by market participants given how little these currencies had moved previously.  The reasons for permitting this appreciation probably differ from one country to the next , but some have probably hit the point where they need to balance competitive issues vis -à-vis China aga inst the inflationary impact on their own economy of continuing to intervene in foreign exchange markets.  The balance may November 10, 20045 of 107have shifted back somewhat overnight in South Korea , which reportedly intervened aggressively to prevent a further rise of the won.  Market participants estimated that the intervention was between $600 million and $2 billion.  Other Asian currencies depreciated modestly as well.   Mr. Chairman, there were no foreign operations by the Desk in the period.  If you agree, I suggest that we pause for any questions and approval of the domestic operations.  Then I could say a few words about the memo that Vincent and I circulated last week about the Desk ’s domestic operations.  CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Why don ’t you do that?  MR. KOS.  Shall we do that now?  CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Yes, why don ’t you get it out of the way?   MR. KOS.  Okay, fine.  At the last meeting, the Committee asked Vincent and me to be a “committee of two” to review how the Desk operates during a period when the market strongly expect s the Committee to change the target fed funds rate.  I should say that most of the work was conducted by Spence Hilton, who is sitting to my left, and by Jim Clouse from the Board’ s staff, who is also here today.  I won ’t repeat everything that ’s in the memo, which I think speaks for itself, but I ’ll summarize our primary conclusions.  First, we found that the volatility of the fed funds rate does not seem to correlate with any major asset class.  Therefore, to the extent that there is volatility in this n arrow sector, it has no observable adverse spillover effects.  We also believe that over time the Desk has the tools to deal with such circumstances.  Indeed, we think we learned something from the August experience that helped us manage the funds rate around the September FOMC meeting.  And over time, as both the Desk and bank reserve managers adapt to the new environment, I would expect this type of volatility to dissipate. If the Committee did wish to change the regime, the choices fall in two categories .  First, FOMC meeting dates could consciously be aligned to coincide with the end of the reserve maintenance period.  A variation would be for policy changes to take effect in the next reserve period.  A second possibility would involve publishing reserve  forecasts.  Both of these regime-November 10, 20046 of 107"
75,20041214,"¼ percentage point higher.  At the long e nd of the curve, as shown at the bottom right, the relationship is more volatile.  But there, too, dolla r interest rates are higher by about ½ percentage point—with the most  recent widening driven almost entirely by a fall in German yields, as recent data disappointed.  I shoul d note that Japanese yields, although not shown here, also have fallen modestly, as incoming data were disappointing there as well.  The favorable shift in interest rate differ entials might have been expected to help the value of the dollar.  However, as show n at the top of page 2, the dollar has been on a downward trend.  In mid-November, comments about the current account by Secretary Snow and Chairman Greenspan in  the days surrounding the G-20 meeting in Europe were interpreted by some as si gnaling acquiescence to the dollar’s fall, though sentiment was so bearish at the tim e that perhaps any comments might have had the same response.  With the market so  one-sided, it did become vulnerable to a sudden reversal, even in the absence of any fundamental news.  The extent of the positions can be seen in the middle panel, which graphs the IMM’s net noncommercial positions for three majo r currencies—the euro, the yen, and sterling—against the dollar.  After a rather  uneventful summer, speculators began to build up short dollar positions in early fall.  By mid-November sentiment was overwhelmingly bearish and positions extended.  As some accounts began to reduce risk, there was position squaring in severa l so-called crowded tr ades, including these short dollar positions, which fed last week ’s appreciation.  The dollar’s fall is certainly affecting returns on U.S. assets for foreigners.  The bottom panel graphs the return year to date for a va riety of asset classes and for the U.S. dollar index.  Returns for most asset classes cluster around 5 per cent, with high-yield bonds being higher.  But for foreign investors, returns for most classes are closer to zero, given the nearly 5 percent fall in the dollar.  Another focus of market a ttention has been the behavi or of Asian central banks from both a policy and a portfolio perspectiv e.  Page 3 provides updates of two charts I showed at the last meeting.  The top pane l graphs the Chinese yuan spot rate—fixed at 8.28—and the one-, six-, and twelve -month forward rates derived from nondeliverable forwards that are traded offshor e and settled in dollars.  This is a small market, but it is one of the few indicators of speculative interest  regarding the size and timing of a possible revalu ation of the yuan.  Since your  last meeting, the forward discounts have widened, as speculation grew of a near-term change in the regime.  This is despite Premier Wen’s comments th at any move to make the exchange rate more flexible would not come if there we re pressure from fo reigners or from the markets.  That does place China’s official s in a box since they have conceded the principle, and one would expect that markets will intermittently pr ice in a change in the regime.  Meanwhile, other Asian countries have allowed some appreciation against the dollar—and therefore agains t the yuan—in recent months, as shown in the middle panel.  However, the pace of reserve accumulation has again begun to rise, suggesting that the authorities are nearing their limits.  Japan, on the other hand, has not December 14, 20044 of 118intervened, perhaps in part because the rise of the Kor ean won and other currencies means that Japan’s effective exchange rate has not risen as much as the yen’s bilateral rate against the dollar.  Investors have watched closely these countries’ willingness to tolerate further appreciation.  But they are watching at least as closely how these countries are managing the reserves they have accumulated.  There are two dimensions to this question.  First, are these central banks di versifying away from the dollar?  Several weeks ago a Russian central bank official publ icly disclosed that the Russian central bank had shifted some of its dollar reserv es into euros.  That announcement and—until recently—the steady decline in the dol lar fed speculation that Asian central banks might act similarly.  Of course, if ther e were a shift from dollars to euros, the immediate effect would be a further apprecia tion of the euro, which would result in an additional reduction in the value of the Asian central banks’ remaining dollars.  Also, a further appreciation of the euro is  something the ECB might resist at some point.  To date, several Asian central banks  have said that they have no plans to change their currency allocations, th ough market participants are wary.  The second dimension of the question is whether central banks are diversifying their dollar holdings from Treasuries into othe r asset classes.  Hard data on this point are hard to come by.  Anecdotally, those central banks with large reserve holdings have been growing both their Treasury a nd non-Treasury holdings for some time, though it’s fair to say that the growth ra tes of agency, MBS, and even corporate holdings have been faster than that for Tr easuries.  The bottom panel graphs the New York Fed’s aggregate custody holdings for Tr easury and agencies since the start of the year.  I should stress that this is an incomplete data set since central banks also hold securities with other custodians.  Nevertheless, this does suggest that—especially in recent weeks—there has b een a spike in agency holdings whereas Treasury holdings have been flat.  We are aware of one major account that sold outright some of its Treasuri es and re-allocated into agencies.  Since the buys and sells for such securities ar e conducted with different count erparties, it is entirely possible that those dealers seeing the sale of Treasuries may have extrapolated in thinking that this account wa s also selling the underlying dollars—and thus fed some of the rumors in recent weeks.   Turning to domestic markets on the next page, the short intermeeting period featured a continuation of recent trends.  Spreads are low and, if anything, have narrowed further.  Implied volatilities contin ued at very low leve ls, and the price of oil continued to fall while pri ces of equities rose.  The t op panel of page 4 graphs the two-year to ten-year spread.  The yield curve has continued to  flatten though there was a sharp, if brief, steepening in late November driven more by technical factors than any fundamental news.  Once the unw inding subsided, th e curve resumed its flattening trend and at 121 basis points is at it s flattest level in more than three years.  Financial conditions remain favorable.  As noted, corporate and emerging-market spreads are narrow.  The middle panel graphs  the absolute yield level for the EMBI+ and High-Yield indexes since 1997.  The comb ination of a lower Treasury curve and December 14, 20045 of 118narrower spreads has lowered absolute yields to levels where financial comedians are asking if the name of the high-yield index w ill need to be changed.  Finally, mortgage spreads continue to trade at low levels, as shown in the bottom left panel.  The large holdings of MBS previously accumulated by banks continue to attract attention on the theory that a sudden spread widening would trigger this group of investors to start liquidating these positions.  Turning to page 5, let me provide a quick update on the growth of outright Treasury holdings in the System Open Mark et Account.  The top panel graphs the net expansion of the SOMA from 1994 through 2003.  Not surprisingly, there is a correlation over the long term between the gr owth of currency in circulation and the growth of SOMA.  During this ten-year  period, currency in circulation grew by $35 billion per year (averaging over the Y2 K event).  Through November 2004 it has increased by $32 billion this  year.  Although similar in dollar magnitude to prior years, that represents a sl owdown in currency growth from about 7¼ percent in the 1994-2003 period to just under 6 percent this year.  The somewhat slower currency growth that has emerged in recent years appears to reflect weaker overseas demand.  The bottom panel graphs the Federal Reserv e’s direct net currency shipments going back to 1990—a somewhat longer period than  in the first two panels.  I should note that these data cover only the Fed’s ship ments and receipts.  We do not know how much currency left the country—or came b ack—via migrant workers, tourists, and other legal or illegal means, though we have no evidence to suggest that those relationships have chan ged in recent years.  In many years through 1997, foreign growth composed the bulk of overall currency growth.  Starting in 1998, ship ments overseas began to moderate, and averaging out Y2K effects, the overall trend of foreign shipments has been falling and in the last two years has turned negativ e.  Without the significant shipments to Argentina and Iraq in recent years, these numbers would have been lower still.  Mr. Chairman, that concludes my prepar ed remarks.  There were no foreign operations in the period.  I will need appr oval of domestic operations, and I’d be happy to take any questions.  CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  With respect to th e direct net currency shipments abroad, recently I have seen reconciliation s between other techniques that en deavor to get to the aggregate amount of currency held abroad and the direct currency shipment s.  Are those other techniques indicating much the same story?  I presume, with the gr owth of currency in circulation slowing and with the foreign piece such a huge part of that, that a direct measure of shipments looks much like what we estimate is the total.  Is that accurate? December 14, 20046 of 118"

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I’ll entertain a motion for the proposed slate.  SEVERAL. So moved. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Without objection, that is approved.  The next item on the agenda is the selection of a Federal Reserve Bank to execute transactions for the System Open Market Account. My notes indicate to me, and I quote, “New York is the odds-on favorite.”  [Laughter] In that event, not wishing to go against the odds, I will entertain any motion which is restricted to nominating the Federal Reserve Bank of New York! MR. FERGUSON. Well, consistent with the odds and tradition, I will nominate the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. The nomination is approved without objection.  Since we have done that, let’s move to a decision that may be far more important, which is to select the Manager of the System Open Market Account.  I understand that there’s only one name on this ballot, and it’s Dino Kos. Unless anyone has an objection, I will presume that there was a nomination, a second, and a unanimous vote in the affirmative.  Hearing no objection to that, I presume that that selection is now approved. Now I’d like to call on Dino in his renewed official position. MR. KOS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I have two subjects on which I’ll need a vote from the Committee.  The first one is on the Foreign Currency Directive, the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations, and the Procedural Instructions with Respect to Foreign Currency Operations.  I recommend that they be approved with no amendments. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Questions?  Objections?  If not, they are approved.February 1-2, 20055 of 177MR. KOS. The second item is the Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations, which I propose be approved with one amendment as described in the memo dated January 24, 2005. That amendment would eliminate the so-called leeway provisions—the limit on the amount by which holdings of securities in the System Open Market Account can change between meetings—given that the Committee has many other ways to oversee the activities of SOMA [System Open Market Account]. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Any questions ?  Approved without objection. We have received documents on proposed revisions to the Committee’s rules, statements, and resolutions, and I presume you have read them.  I need a vote to approve the proposed revisions, but, obviously, if there are comments, we will discuss them prior to that.  Hearing none, they are approved without objection. Incidentally, because of the timing, we need to determine officially as a Committee that public notice and comment on these amendments would be unnecessary or contrary to the public interest. I would accept a motion to that effect. SPEAKER(?).  So moved.  CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Approved without objection. We have an annual review of the Committ ee’s Program for the Security of FOMC Information.  I’d like to emphasize a point covered on page 1, which is that individuals who have access to confidential information may provide it to or discuss it only with those Federal Reserve employees who are authorized to have access to such information.  I raise these issues every year. We all vote upon these rules and agree to bind ourselves to them, and invariably we slip periodically.  I trust that at some point we’ll do better than we have done, especially fairly recently. I understand that President Moskow would like to say a few words on this. MR. MOSKOW.  Mr. Chairman, I think the leak of the topic for today’s discussion, which was the subject of an article that appeared in The Wall Street Journal, was very disappointing andFebruary 1-2, 20056 of 177troubling. I’ve been with the Federal Reserve for10 years, and we pride ourselves on being an organization with very high integrity. When we have a leak like that, I think it’s really an embarrassment to the Federal Reserve and to each of us individually.  Leaks such as this have happened on rare occasions in the period that I’ve been here. But I think it is important that we emphasize every year, in line with the integrity of th is organization, how crucial it is to maintain the confidentiality of what we discuss. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I’m at a loss to understand the motives of communicating obviously confidential information that could compromise the nature of our deliberations here.  What is to be gained?  I don’t get it. All I can do is to reiterate, as we vote on this, that we take it very seriously. I will assume everyone is in the affirmative on this. We will now move on to a rather large topic, price objectives for monetary policy.  I’d like to call on David Wilcox, Doug Elmendorf, and Vincent Reinhart to make their presentations. MR. WILCOX.1  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  We’ll be referring to the package of      material entitled “Considerations Pertaining to the Establishment of a Specific, Numerical, Price-Related Objective for Monetary Policy.” As a prelude to your discussion this afternoon, Doug Elmendorf and I will briefly summarize some of the main points made in the R&S [Research and Statistics] staff paper that was distributed to the Committee.  Then Vincent will address the issues related to communications and governance that would arise were you to define a numerical objective. As can be seen in the top panel of your first exhibit, inflation as measured by any of the major indexes has been both low and stable by historical standards for the last several years. With the economy now operating in the neighborhood of price stability, some analysts have pressed for more clarity and precision about your ultimate objectives with respect to the price-related piece of your dual mandate.  Others, however, have expressed serious re servations about moving away from what they perceive to be a successful status quo. The background paper discusses the major issues the Committee would need to consider in determining whether to adopt a specific, numerical, price-related objective.   We view the key characteristics of such an objective, listed in the middle panel, as the following: First, it would be numerical rather than qualitative.  Second, 1 The materials used by Messrs. W ilcox, Elmendorf, and Re inhart are appended to this transcript (appendix 1)."
77,20050322,"March 22, 20054 of 116Until the last few weeks, the combination of a gentle rise in short-term rates and an immovable 10-year yield had substantially flattened the yield curve.  The recent price moves did not reverse that trend but did, as shown in the bottom panel, stabilize the shape of the curve, which stopped flattening at about 80 basis points. The last few weeks also featured an increased preoccupation among traders and investors with the prospects for inflation. Several inflation reports were higher than expected, and commodity prices continued to rise.  For example, the top panel of page 2 shows the CRB [Commodity Research Bureau] index since January 2004.  Unlike other popular commodity indexes, the CRB does not have a large energy component and was more contained during 2004. The recent breakout had contributions from nearly every segment of the index. Focusing on energy, the middle panel depicts the oil futures curve out to two years for West Texas intermediate [WTI] as of two dates.  The green line shows the curve as of October 26, 2004, the day oil prices hit their highs last fall and when the front-month contract topped $55 per barrel.  The curve sloped downward by more than $10, and, for contracts at the end of that two-year horizon, oil was trading below $45. The blue line graphs the WTI curve as of this past Friday.  The front-month contract was trading at about $57, but the curve has only a small downward slope; and the contract 24 months out is trading near $53, suggesting that market participants do not expect much softening in oil prices. The bottom panel graphs in blue the five-year TIPS [Treasury inflation-protected securities] breakeven inflation rate, which has been rising the past few weeks and is up substantially from a year ago.  This rise in the breakeven rate has been contemporaneous with the most recent increase in oil prices.  During last fall’s oil price rise, the breakeven was falling. Higher oil prices were seen more as a restraint on activity than as a catalyst for inflation. The situation has now reversed, though there are lots of caveats one needs to consider when interpreting breakeven rates. Other market-based measures of inflationary expectations are tame.  For example, the five-year breakeven five years ahead has remained in a narrow range, as shown by the red line, and, in fact, is very little changed from a year ago. One question that has occupied market participants is whether risk is being mispriced.  The narrowing of spreads over the past two years and the fall of volatility suggest that investors have been in risk-seeking mode.  In the intermeeting period, that trend did not reverse, though it did moderate somewhat. The top left panel on page 3 shows the investment-grade corporate spread since mid-year 2004; in the top right is the high-yield spread.  Both have narrowed substantially in the last year or two. At its lowest level in the period, the high-yield spread was at 266 basis points on March 6. The all-time low for the high-yield spread was 213 basis points in October of 1997. In recent weeks, both indexes widened suddenly, contemporaneous with the rise in Treasury yields and someMarch 22, 20055 of 116specific corporate events. Though sudden, the recent widening was modest compared to other widening episodes during the last two years and relative to the previous narrowing episodes. Of course, the widening did not affect all issuers equally.  The bottom left panel graphs the spreads of investment-grade issuers by credit rating.  The AA, A, and BBB sectors are all narrower than they were a year ago, but in the past few weeks the BBB sector underperformed, as investors got nervous about the auto sector in general and General Motors in particular after that company reported disappointing earnings.  The bottom right panel graphs the auto sector in green and representative 10-year GM and GMAC bond spreads. GM credit default swaps widened as well. The pessimist will take this price action as suggesting that risks are mispriced and that market participants have not been adequately anticipating deteriorating outlooks. The optimist will conclude from the GM news that markets are discriminating among issuers as new information becomes available and are repricing accordingly.  Turning to page 4, the top panel depicts the EMBI+ [Emerging Markets Bond Index Plus] spread, which also widened in recent weeks but only to levels observed in January. The conclusion of the Argentine debt package, with its large haircuts, did not appear to have a contagion effect on the spreads of other large issuers. Parts of the outer rim of the risk spectrum did feel a chill, as shown in the middle and bottom panels.  The middle panel graphs movements of a select group of emerging-market currencies against the dollar in the period between October and March 7. Several of these currencies had rallied by more than 10 percent.  The green bars show the depreciations of the past two weeks. The bottom panel shows the same set of relationships for the broad equity market indexes of the same group of countries.  Yes, there has been some unwinding of these positions in both currencies and equities. But, to date, the retracing has been mild and represents only a fraction of the appreciation observed in previous months.  In short, if this is the beginning of a more general unwinding, there is far more to go.   I should also note that the dollar has been firmer against the euro and other major currencies the past few days, which may suggest a bit of risk aversion, as the possibility of a more aggressive tightening cycle is causing a reassessment among the large contingent of dollar shorts. Finally, turning to page 5, I have graphed the implied volatilities of the S&P 500, representative swaptions contracts, and the major currency pairs.  I won’t go through them in any detail but would only point out the following: (1) they are still at very low levels; and (2) there are signs for both equity and swaption vols that the downward trend is confronting a bit more headwind at these very low levels, especially if the inflation and monetary policy outlook changes meaningfully in coming weeks.Mr. Chairman, there were no foreign operations in the intermeeting period.  I will need a vote to approve domestic operations.  Bob and I will be happy to take any questions about markets or about the memo I circulated last week regarding some changes we are planning to make to the yen reserves portfolio. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Go over again what is in the CRB index. This is the spot index. 	 What’s in there?  MR. KOS. Yes. Oil is a little less than a quarter of that index. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. That’s a big number.  MR. KOS. Yes, it’s about 23 percent, but that com pares to about two-thirds or three-quarters weighting that energy has in the Goldman Sachs and the Dow Jones–AIG indexes, for example.  The other components are—   CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. What else is in there?  MR. KOS. “Softs,” as they are called—things like agricultural commodities and metals.      CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Agricultural com modities.  But grain prices have come  down in the most recent data.  I assume iron ore is in there? MR. KOS. I don’t know if iron ore is in there but copper is; copper scrap is in there, I think. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. That couldn’t have done that much.  Steel, for example, is actually down. MR. KOS. I don’t think steel is in the CRB. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. It’s a very unusual index. The reason I raise the issue is because it doesn’t look like any commodity index I’m used to watching—unless oil is a very big component.  Do we know that?  We can factor out the oil part of this.

78,20050503,"May 3, 20054 of 116contracted sharply at the start of the tightening cycle but then settled into a comfortable range of 80 to 85 basis points.  In February and early March the spread widened to about 120 basis points as the pr obability of more aggressive tightening seemed to increase.  But as the growth outlook began to be questioned in recent weeks, the spread reverted to about 80 basis points. The bottom panel depicts the yield change in basis points of the 10-year Treasury note reset from the start of the tightening cycles of 1994, 1999, and the current one.   Following the Chairman’s February testimony, 10-year Treasury yields rose to levels where they—arguably—were less of a conundrum.  Alas, that also proved temporary as the fall in yields leaves them stuck in a corridor between 4 and 4½ percent. At 4.19 percent this morning, the 10-year yield is only a few basis points higher than in mid-February at the time of the Chairman’s testimony. The next page takes a look at the yield curve and credit spreads. In the past year the search for yield, improved corporate and sovereign fundamentals, and the assurance the Fed was providing regarding the tightening path were common reasons cited for the flattening of the yield curve. As investors moved out the maturity curve, credit spreads narrowed and implied volatilities fell as market participants became more certain that monetary policy would not bring surprises.  The past few weeks has seen a reversal, or at least a pause, in some of these trends. One exception to this has been the behavior of the shape of the yield curve. The top panel graphs the 2- to 10-year spread, which flattened further in recent weeks. However, unlike the earlier flattening, this cannot be viewed as a period when investors were reaching for yield or when they were very complacent about the policy outlook. Nor is there evidence that central banks were unusually active. An alternative, though more unpleasant explanation, is that this sector of the bond market is signaling a further slowdown in activity. Investment-grade corporate and emerging-market spreads both widened in recent weeks, as investors became somewhat more risk averse and reacted to some unexpected credit events. The recent widening of spreads in these two sectors can be seen on the right side of the page. However, this widening of spreads barely registers in the longer-term charts on the left side of the page.  The optimist will look at this situation and be reassured that the markets are not overreacting to events and are still pricing in a fairly benign outlook. The pessimist will argue that the power of the cycle will continue to assert itself and that the period of spreads widening is just beginning, especially as the effects of previous tightening begin to be felt and corporate fundamentals shift from being in a period of improvement to a period of deterioration. Speaking of deterioration, the top panel on the page 3 graphs the price of 5-year credit default swaps for GM, GMAC, and Ford since January 2004. The price ofMay 3, 20055 of 116credit protection has more than tripled, mostly after GM’s earnings warning on March 16. Meanwhile, spreads have widened, as shown in the middle panel.  Although GM has more than $20 billion in cash on its balance sheet and the company is still investment-grade according to the rating agencies, it is a high-yield bond according to the markets.  The blue line graphs the spread of a representative longer-term GM note. GM spreads are now wider than the BB and B indexes and closing in on the CCC index. Ford spreads are also tradi ng like high-yield credits, though not as high as those of GM. The news from GM appears to have had some chilling effects on issuance in the high-yield sector more generally, though the evidence is inconclusive.  The bottom left panel shows the drop-off in high-yield issuance since the GM news.  Of course, other events were going on at the same time, such as the changed tenor of the macro data and the fall in equity prices.  Still, a plausible contributory explanation is that high-yield managers were unreceptive to taking on new paper with the prospect of a large migration of auto-related debt coming into their sector.  One important question mark for portfolio managers is whether the troubles in the auto industry are sector-specific or whether the general period of improving corporate balance sheets is ending, to be followed by a period of higher financing costs, margin compression, and generalized credit deterioration. The bottom right panel graphs the largest components of one high-yield bond index on a pro forma basis if GM were to be downgraded.  Apparently GM would account for about 6 percent of this index. With GM spreads having already blown out, a downgrade may not have that much of an effect—on the theory that markets have already discounted the news. Of course, GM and GMAC are large issuers in the investment-grade sector, which is much larger than the high-yield sector.  Therefore, we should not be surprised if there were some indigestion and a period of volatility, as a very large amount of paper is transferred from one set of holders with one set of time horizons and risk tolerances to another group with a different set of preferences. As I mentioned earlier, implied volatilities were higher, although not in all asset classes. But they were higher for equities.  The top panel of page 4 graphs the VIX index since January 2004. After reaching a low near 11 percent, the index shot up to about 19 percent during the recent period of equity price weakness. It has since settled back but in a choppy way. In fact, the volatility of the VIX—the second derivative—is as high as it has been during periods of more generalized market stress. Fixed income and currency volatilities have been less exciting—in the middle and bottom part of the page—reflecting less anxiety relative to other indicators.  I should note that dollar-yen volatilities rose on Friday when a brief flurry ofMay 3, 20056 of 116excitement about a possible revaluation of the renminbi spilled over into dollar-yen and there was a temporary spike in implied volatility. Finally, I want to return to a subject that was mentioned briefly at the last meeting, namely, the appetite for longer-dated paper in Europe.  As you will recall, early in 2005 there was a mini frenzy about the need for pension fund managers to “extend duration.” European issuers have been quite happy to step in and fill that demand at pretty attractive levels.  This is despite the watering down of the Stability and Growth Pact and evidence that some countries showed creativity in managing their financials to get into EMU [European Monetary Union] in the first place. The top panel simply graphs the German and U.S. 30-year yields; German yields have been consistently below those of the United States in 2005. Parenthetically I do need to note that the last U.S. long bond was issued in 2001 so the U.S. 30-year bond actually has a residual maturity of 26 years.  While a 30-year Bund yield of just under 4 percent could prompt one to ask what the German word for “conundrum” is [laughter], there is no doubt that the environment has been favorable to issuers—and not just for the most highly rated.  As shown in the middle panel, spreads among European sovereign issuers have converged over the last several years, just as promised by the proponents of the Monetary Union.  Among the higher-rated issuers, France recently was able to issue a 50-year bond. At the other end, Greece issued an attractively priced 30-year security. The bottom panel graphs long-dated issuance—that is, beyond 10 years—for euro area sovereigns since 2000. In 2000, all long dated issuance was by three countries: Germany, Italy, and France.  Through only the first four months of 2005, such issuance has already exceeded that for the full year in every recent year except 2000. And most of the issuance is by countries other than the three I mentioned earlier. Mr. Chairman, there were no foreign operations in the intermeeting period.  I will need a vote to approve domestic operations.  And I also need to talk about swaps. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. It’s sort of sad to look at the composition of the Lehman Brothers high-yield index. I’m looking at some of the names in the context of 30 years ago— General Motors, AT&T, and Georgia Pacific. The world is telling us that there is creative destruction out there. To what extent do the GM, Ford, and collateral issues, as they move out of investment-grade into high-yield, impact the average yields of, say, BBBs?  Clearly, we are getting a huge increase in"
79,20050630,"3 The materials used by Messrs. Gallin, Lehnert, Peach, Rudebusch, and Williams are appended to this transcript (appendix 1).  June 29-30, 20054 of 234presented all five and then opened the floor for di scussion and questions afterward.  We recognize that a long presentation, coming right after lunch and while a numbe r of you are still probably a bit jet-lagged, could test your powers of concentration, but I think you’ll find the presenters to be both well informed and entertaining.  [Lau ghter]  So with that we’ll begin.  MR. GALLIN.3 Thank you. My presentation begins on the th ird page of the handout you received. It seems that everybody is  talking about house prices, and the upper panel of your first exhibit shows why:  House prices, adjusted for ge neral inflation, have risen at a rapid pace in recent years and did no t even pause during the last recession. Indeed, the real rate of appreciation has increased, and the most r ecent readings have been at annual rates greater than 7 per cent.  By comparison, the average annual increase in real house prices during the pa st 30 years is only about 1¾ percent. The next two panels illustrate some of  the eye-popping gains that have been recorded in selected metropo litan areas.  For example, as  shown in the middle left panel, real house prices increased about 16  percent in San Fran cisco and 30 percent in Las Vegas during the four-quarter period ending in the first quarter; as shown to the right, the most re cent gain was 13 percent in New Yo rk and 20 percent in Miami.   Rapid price appreciation has sparked deba te about whether ho using has become overvalued, and the popular press is filled wi th stories suggesting that it has.  As summarized in the lower left  panel, anecdotes suggesting that the housin g market is overheated include those about increased sp eculation, purchase decisions that are perhaps too dependent on rosy assessments of future appreciation, and increased reliance on novel forms of fina ncing without full recognition of the associated risks.  Although these anecdotes are suggestive,  they do not provide a benchmark for valuing housing.  Two approaches that do provide a benchmar k are listed to the right.  One is to ask if housing is affordable  for a typical family.  Some analysts have argued that prices are too hi gh relative to incomes, while others say low interest rates have kept required monthly mortgage paymen ts affordable.  Another approach is to ask if house prices are properly aligned with  rents.  I have pursued both approaches in my research, and have co ncluded that rents provide a preferable benchmark for valuing housing. I w ill therefore focus my prepared remarks on this approach.    As summarized in the upper left panel of your next exhibit, a strength of this approach is that it employs a standard a sset pricing framework, such as that often used in studies of stock market  valuation.  In th is framework, rental payments in the housing market are analogous to dividends in the stock market.  Seen this way, theJune 29-30, 20055 of 234price of a house should reflect the appropriate ly discounted stream of expected rents; high prices could be justified by high re nts or by low carrying costs, which include interest payments, net taxes, and depreciation.  But if prices appear unusually high relative to rents and carrying co sts, one might conclude that housing is ov ervalued.   As highlighted to the right, I have implemented the framework using repeat-transactions price in dexes from the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight [OFHEO] and Freddie Mac and the tenants’  rent index from the consumer price index.  I made several adjustments to these series to address some of the shortcomings of the publishe d data.  As you will see in Dick Peach’s presentation, he and I disagree about the best way to measure house pr ices.  I would be happy to discuss the issue during the question period.   That said, the red line in the middle pa nel shows the estimate d price-rent ratio for the stock of housing, a nd the black line shows the esti mated real carrying cost of housing. The first point to no te is that the me asured price-rent ratio is currently higher than at any earlier time for which we  have data.  Moreover, the run-up in prices appears to be far greater  than can be explained by ca rrying costs, at  least if we use the historical relationship  between the two series as our  guide.  Alth ough theory suggests a tight link between carrying costs and the price-rent ra tio, the data  suggest that the actual link is more te nuous.  At the simp lest level, while th e price-rent ratio is at a historical high, the carrying cost is  not at a historical low.  More formally, regression analysis suggests that prices are about 20 percent too high given rents and carrying costs.    One might reasonably ask wh at this potential 20 per cent overvaluation portends for house prices.  The lower panel summari zes the historical experience on this question.  The panel shows a scatter plot of  the price-rent ratio (on the horizontal axis) and changes in real house prices over the subsequent three years (on the vertical axis); the panel al so includes a fitted regression line.  As I mentioned a moment ago, carrying costs are only slightly correlated with the price-rent ratio.  Thus, their effects can be excluded from the ch art without materially affecting the results. The downward slope of the regression line summarizes a key finding: When house prices have been high relative to  rents, subsequent price changes have typically been smaller than us ual.  For example, on the right side of the panel we can see that in the second quarte r of 1979, the price-rent ra tio stood above 24, and real prices decreased 7 percent during the subsequent three years.  Near the other end of the scale, in the third quarter of 1970 th e price-rent ratio stood just above 19, and real prices increased more than 5 perc ent during the subsequent three years.  However, as is readily apparent from the chart, the relationshi p is loose.  Most notably, in the first quarter of 2002, the la st observation for which we have a reading for the subsequent three-year change in house prices, the pr ice-rent ratio stood at 22.  Although the regression suggests that real prices should have been about flat sinceJune 29-30, 20056 of 234then, real prices actually incr eased more than 20 percent, and the price-rent ratio rose to about 27—literally off the chart.   To give an impression of  what has happened in local  markets, the upper panel of your next chart summarizes housing- market conditions for four metropolitan areas:  San Francisco, New York, Chicago, and Miami.  The panel displays the deviation of each city’s pri ce-rent ratio from its long-ru n level in the second quarter of 1979 (the red bars), the fourth quarter of 1989 (the  black bars), and the first quarter of 2005 (the green bars ).  The numbers above the ba rs indicate their height.  The first two episodes represent previous pe aks of the price-rent ratio at the national level. The third episod e is where we are now. The numbers below the red and black bars  show the performance of real house prices in each city in the three years following each epis ode.  For instance, as shown by the red bar, the price-rent ratio in San Francisco was 7 percent above its long-run level in the middle of 1979.  During the su bsequent three years, real house prices there fell 5 percent.  At the end of 1989 (the black bar) the price-rent ratio in San Francisco was 15 percent above its long-ru n level, and real prices there fell 12 percent during the subsequent three y ears.  The most recent reading for San Francisco indicates that the price-rent ratio is now further above its long-run level than in either 19 79 or 1989.   The price-rent ratios sugges t that housing is overvalued in the other three cities as well, but to differing degrees.  Alth ough the price-rent ratio in New York is elevated, housing does not lo ok much more overvalued th ere than it did in the late 1980s.  House prices appear elevated relative to rents in  Chicago as we ll, but it is Miami that stands out as the most overh eated of the four markets shown here.   The evidence that I have shown you so far suggests that rents provide a loose tether for house prices; prices deviate from  their long-run relationship with rents for extended periods, but not inde finitely.  However, to pr ovide a forecast of house prices, we must consider both the long-run relationship between prices and rents and the short-run dynamics among prices and other economic factors.  The middle left panel of your exhibit lists several factors th at affect real house-price dynamics in the short run.  In particular, the Board’s st aff has found that a basic model should include lagged changes in house prices, as well as changes in real income, real carrying costs, and the unempl oyment rate.  This basic model does not take a stand on whether housing is overvalued.  Alternat ively, our error-corr ection model adds to the basic model the lagged level of the price-rent ratio and the lagged level of carrying costs.  It therefore provides a formal way to model short-run dynamics around a long-run equilibrium  level.  The estimated co efficient on the lagged price-rent ratio is negative, capturing the idea that there is a long-run relationship between house prices and rents and th at price changes are restrain ed when prices are high relative to rents."
80,20050809,"August 9, 20054 of 110Second, the shift in issuance to hybrid  and other adjustable products has reduced the overall need to hedge convexity for new MBS products.  And third, those who do hedge mortgage convexity are more likely to hedge up front with interest rate  options and less likely to  hedge dynamically with swaps or Treasuries. The low level of implied volatili ty has made it cheap to buy interest rate options for hedging, and several mortgage hedgers have increased their use of op tion hedges after their d ynamic hedging strategies produced poor results in  the summer of 2003. Finally, there has been some shift at  the margin among the holders of MBS from those who hedge actively to those who probably do not.  As shown in the bottom left panel, the two major housing GSEs [government-sponsored enterprises]—which do hedge actively—have seen their portfo lios level off or shrink outright. Meanwhile, one group that has been accu mulating MBS is foreign official accounts. The bottom right panel graphs aggregate holdings of GSE securities held by foreign accounts at the New York  Fed since January 2002.  Despite the accounting and management problems at both major GSEs, central banks kept buying GSE securities over the past few y ears; their overall holdings more than doubled to over $360 billion. Most of those holdings are direct obligations.  But MBS, which were essentially zero only  two years ago, now make up about $66 billion, or almost 20 percent of agen cy holdings.  Moreover, this number probably understates total central bank holdings of MBS since some central banks have outsourced management of  their MBS portfolios to external managers who use other custodians. Moving to page three, the corporate ma rket recovered very quickly after its springtime jitters.  The top right panel shows the high-yield spread, which has narrowed by more than 100 basis point s since early May.  Taking a longer-term time frame, as shown in the top left pane l, even at recent peaks spreads are at very low levels. While spreads are narrow, quality has shown some signs of deterioration. The middle panel graphs for 1987 thr ough 2005-to-date the percent of high-yield issuance comprised of securities rated at B- or lower at the time of issuance. In the past year, roughly 40 percent have been in this category, exceeding the levels seen in early 1998 and also in the late 1980s during the junk bond boom.  The use of those proceeds is shown in the bottom panel.  After several years of focusing on ba lance sheet repair, mainly through refinancing, issuers are getting a bit more aggressive.  Let me draw your attention to the red bar at  the bottom of the stack.  So far in 2005, about 20 percent of issuance has been used to  finance leveraged buyouts—the highest that number has been since 1989.August 9, 20055 of 110Moving overseas, the picture was mixed.  In the euro area, economic data were, at the margin, somewh at better than had been expected.  Those improved data and statements by ECB [European Ce ntral Bank] officials that they were not contemplating an easing of policy shifted sentiment in euro area money markets.  As shown in the top left pa nel on page 4, the 9-month forward rate agreement on 3-month euro deposits—th e solid green line—rose sharply and unwound the ease that had been priced in to markets around the time of the last FOMC meeting.  The ECB has now maintain ed its key policy rate at 2 percent for 26 consecutive months. In contrast, the Bank of England eased  policy by 25 basis points last week, as expected. And as shown in the top ri ght panel, another easing is expected.   In Asia, the Chinese revaluation was the most noteworthy news event, even though, overall, the price action in regiona l markets was tame.  Ex ante, the currency that was expected to appreciate the most if China were to move was the Japanese yen. And on the day of the Chinese announcement, the yen rose sharply. But that was quickly unwou nd and—as shown in the middle left panel—the yen remains broadly weaker co mpared to its level at the beginning of the year. Japanese exporters, who re portedly are using a reference rate of ¥105, are feeling very comfortable w ith the yen at these levels.  With data such as this morning’s st rong machinery orders suggesting that the Japanese recovery is intact, equi ties and JGB [Japanese government bond] yields have both been rising. The 10 -year JGB yield has risen to about 1.4 percent.  The failure of the Diet to approve the postal reform bill and the upcoming elections will add some uncer tainty in coming weeks, though most market participants are no longer questi oning the recovery even  if deflationary pressures on prices persist. The bottom panel shows the Chinese yuan spot rate since May 9 in black and the 1-, 6-, and 12-month NDF [non-deli verable forward] rates over the same period. The July 21 revaluation announ cement caught the market by surprise.  However, the small 2.1 percent revaluati on, the vague nature of the new regime, the virtually fixed rate ve rsus the dollar since July  21, and finally the July 26 announcement by the People’s Bank of China that this was not the “first step” of a broader revaluation took the wind out  of the sails of t hose expecting more forceful measures.  Indeed, the longer- term NDF tenors are virtually unchanged from levels prevailing before July 21.  Other regional currencies also appreciated briefly but, with the exception of the Malaysian ringgit, those moves have been largely unwound. Turning to domestic operations, I wanted to briefly update the Committee on the growth of SOMA [System Open Ma rket Account] in the first half of 2005. The top chart depicts the growth of SOMA’s outright holdings in half-August 9, 20056 of 110yearly increments since 2000.  So far in 2005, SOMA has expanded by only about $7 billion, the slowest growth sin ce the first half of 2000, a period that was distorted by Y2K effects. And, given the rising base, in percentage terms the slow growth of SOMA is even more pronounced. The bottom panel graphs the autonom ous factor changes over those same six-month intervals.  The relationshi p between net factor movements and SOMA growth is not one-for-one but ove r longer periods the two track each other. The notable features of the firs t six months in 2005 are the slow growth of currency (in green) and th e reduction of required operatin g balances (in blue).   Finally, let me say a word about our foreign reserves.  Earlier this year I reported on my plans to shift investme nt of the System’s and the ESF’s [Exchange Stabilization Fund] yen reserves  from Treasury bills to a portfolio of JGB investments and deposits at the Ba nk of Japan.  You will recall that the Japanese t-bill market had become illiquid and, in my view, no longer suitable for a reserve portfolio. After making the necessary system and procedural changes, we recently started the proce ss of rolling off maturing t-bills and investing the proceeds into JGBs and BOJ deposits. Mr. Chairman, once again there were no foreign operations in the period.  I will need a vote to approve  the domestic operations. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. You raised the i ssue of the questionable efficacy of the dynamic hedging engaged in by Fannie and Freddie ea rlier this year or last year—I’ve forgotten exactly when. I don’t reca ll it being both GSEs, and I wasn’t qu ite clear whether that was just a general rumor or what. Is that now confirmed?  MR. KOS. Well, I actually had a different institution in mind—a very large player in this market who did have some issues in ’03.  And they have now changed their hedging strategies. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I understand th at.  You weren’t referring to something new; you were referring back to the original problems. MR. KOS. Yes. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Did they ever  acknowledge that that was a problem? MR. KOS. Well, a fact is something that can be observed and verified, and I’m talking—"
81,20050920,"September 20, 20054 of 117further in the next three weeks across the curve, though the rise was especially pronounced at the short end. With nominal rates, on balance, little changed in the period and the breakeven curve higher, the effect has been to lower and steepen the real yield curve, as shown on the top panel of page 2. Given the arit hmetic relationships between nominal and breakeven yields, this graph merely takes th e information of the last two charts and shows it another way. Nevertheless, the redu ction of real yields is pronounced and may suggest—at least for the next few year s—that investors ha ve an eagerness for protection from rising inflation.  In other as set markets, spreads and volatilities were mixed on balance and did not exhibit any uniform anxiety about a changed outlook.  The middle panel graphs the performance from  July 1 of selected equity indexes.  In general, equities have risen globally in that period, apparently unfazed by higher energy prices. The middle right panel gra phs the performance of the S&P 500 and its major components since the hurricane.  Not surprisingly energy stocks have performed best.  Meanwhile, consumer-related  equities have performed worst.  And some retailers, especially those catering to lower-income households, have been particularly hard hit, as hi gher gasoline prices took their toll on those consumers even before Katrina. Municipal bonds issued by governments in the Gulf region held in fairly well despite the physical destruction.  As an  illustration, the bottom panel graphs the spread to the 10-year Treasury of the New Orleans bond of 2029.  The spread narrowed versus Treasuries and outperform ed the broader index.  Apparently, the prospect of a multibillion-dollar infusion of federal funds quickly eased any anxieties investors might have had. Turning to page 3, there was no uniform  response in the spread and options markets to the hurricane.  The top left pane l shows the implied volatility of a 1-month option on the front-month gasoline contract for the year to date.  With the refinery outages, it’s no surprise that volatilities for gasoline have jumped sharply, though the extent of the spike is noteworthy. However,  as noted earlier, the picture for other assets is mixed.  The top right panel graphs  the implied 1-month volatility of 1- and 10-year swaptions. Volatilities on longer-d ated swaptions barely budged, though for shorter-dated swaptions—which are more se nsitive to changing expectations about monetary policy—volatility rose sharply. With equity markets rising modestly, the VIX [S&P 100 volatility index] traded toward the lower end of its range and actua lly declined after th e hurricane, as shown in the middle left panel.  Meanwhile, volat ilities on currencies, shown in the middle right panel, stayed low in the high single digits.September 20, 20055 of 117Finally, credit spreads showed  no clear pattern.  The inve stment-grade spread at the bottom left and the high-yield spread in yellow at the bottom right both rose slightly. In contrast, th e EMBI+ [Emerging Markets B ond Index Plus] has continued to narrow to an all-time low spread despit e higher energy prices, a political scandal in Brazil, and uncertain elections in 2006 in  several large issuer  countries, including Mexico and Brazil. Turning to page 4, I wanted to return to a topic that President Minehan asked about at the last meeting, namely, the dynami cs related to settlement of the Treasury futures contract. To provide some background and context, th e top panel depicts in the light blue bars the peak open interest in the 10-year Treasury futures contract.  The dark blue bars represent the issue size of the cheapest-to-deliver Treasury security, also called the CTD. Starting in 2002, the volumes a nd open interest in th e futures contracts began to rise sharply. But w ith issue size remaining in the $20 billion range, the ratio of open interest to size of the CTD increased sharply. The growth of peak open interest did not raise eyebrows initially since most futures contracts are used for speculative, hedging, or arbitr age purposes.  Most contracts are closed out or rolled over into the next contract before maturity, and the volume of securities actually delivered was de minimis. For example, the middle left panel gra phs for the March 2002 contract the open interest in blue. With 15 days of trad ing left, open interest was about $40 billion equivalent on the 10-year futures contract. Over the next few days there was a slow decay of open interest, as traders closed out positions or rolled them into the next contract. Only a tiny amount was actually se ttled.  And those with  short positions had no trouble borrowing the August 2010 security, wh ich was the CTD into this contract.  This was the normal state of affairs. However, as the markets have grown, some large market participants have begun to view taking delivery of securities as a vi able option compared to the alternative of slowly building a position in the cash market.  Other traders—perhaps more opportunistically—have noted th e disparity between the peak open interest and the relatively small issue size and may have concluded that there was an increased possibility that the shorts might have to deliver securities othe r than the CTD.  The center middle panel graphs the situation in June.  Open interest decayed very slowly as those with long positions in the futures market did not find it profitable to roll their positions. Instead they  took delivery.  As the shor ts realized they would be forced to deliver, there was a scramble to  find the February 2012 security.  In the event, the shorts were able to find en ough of the CTD—about $14 billion—to fullySeptember 20, 20056 of 117satisfy delivery obligations, but  the experience fostered conspiracy theories and the press articles that follow ed about a possible squeeze. The September contract, which has two days of trading left, is proving equally challenging. As shown in the middle right pa nel, the open interest with 15 days of trading left was an elevated $70 billion or so; and the decay has been slow, suggesting that the longs would trigger a multi-issue delivery.  In the past few days, the open interest has decreased, but the possibility for a multi-issue delivery remains. The CTD in this settlement cycle is th e August of 2012 security.  As one would expect, this issue is hard to find and trad ing very special in the repo market.  The bottom left panel shows in blue the overnig ht repo rate for that security, which has decreased from about 3 percent to zero as it  became apparent that there would be a sizable delivery into the c ontract.  As the security was “boxed,” it has all but stopped trading in the repo market, and fails in the issue jumped to  more than $90 billion and yesterday they were more than $110 billion. From previous experience, those fails should clear up very quickly af ter the contra ct settles. So, has this flurry of activity affected the cash market or the shape of the yield curve?  All indications are that the answer  is no.  The bottom right panel graphs notes in the 5- to 10-year sector as of late last week.  The red dot  is the August of 2012 security. It is trading slightly rich to the curve but not disproportionately so, and it doesn’t seem to be affecting neighboring securities. The Chicago Board of Trade has instituted position limits for individual participants during the last 10 days of tr ading, beginning with the December contract.  Whether that will alleviate the problem or will shift the pressure elsewhere remains to be seen. Mr. Chairman, once again there were no fore ign operations in the period.  In that regard, I want to note that this coming Thursday will mark five years since our last intervention.  I will need a vote to approve domestic operations. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. There is obviously  some perceived advantage in taking delivery of the securities rather than just going into the market a nd purchasing them.  The sort of non-conspiratorial view is that a lot of people think something is  going on and, therefore, they might as well sit and accept delivery even though  that was not their intention when they bought the futures. What do you know is going on?  We cer tainly know who the pa rticipants are—or at least the Exchange knows. What have you learned?"
82,20051101,"November 1, 20054 of 114changed, as seen in the bottom panel.  Th e 2-year break-even in flation [BEI] rate had risen over the summer as energy prices rallied; but it plateaued and came off a bit as the price of oil headed back do wn.  The 10-year BEI was little changed. This suggests that the rise in nominal yi elds was an increase in real rates and suggestive of tightened financial conditions.  The sluggishness in equity markets until this past Friday was consistent with this view. The behavior of break-even rates also cal ls into question some of the instant analysis surrounding Ben Bernanke’s nom ination last Monday.  While some analysts were quick to attribute the rise  in nominal yields last week to the nomination—on the basis of some perceive d squishiness on inflation—the rise in real yields, which had alrea dy been in train, and the fl atness of BEIs do not bear this out. If there is some suggestion that fi nancial conditions are tightening, the evidence elsewhere was mixed.  Certainly, yields in other major economies have been moving higher since the end of the summer, as shown in the top panel of page 2. Long-term sovereign yields in the U.K., Canada, and Germany—the latter as a proxy for the euro area—have b een rising recently.  The rise of nearly 40 basis points in German yields has been particularly noteworthy and may reflect upgraded forecasts for European growth in general and improved sentiment toward Germany, notwithstanding a messy el ection outcome that leaves prospects for reform uncertain. Even Japanese yields have been rising recently.  Investors are increasingly contemplating that maybe, just maybe, af ter so many false starts, this time the recovery is for real.  The better economic tempo and heightened probabilities that sometime in the next 12 months the CP I will no longer be preceded by a negative sign are leading more invest ors to take a defensive posture toward Japanese bonds. Expectations about near-term policy in  those same countries are broadly consistent with the movement in longer-d ated yields.  The middle panel graphs March 2006 futures prices for short-dated in terest rates for the U.S., U.K., Canada and the euro area. Short sterling futures are flat—in itself noteworthy, given that the Bank of England most recently eased policy.  The others are all moving upward to varying degrees.  The middle  right panel graphs the December 2006 euro-yen deposit futures contract, which has also risen as the market tries to anticipate the end of the Ba nk of Japan’s [BOJ] quantitative easing policy, now expected by the market—and the BOJ, as reported in the monthly report yesterday—to be sometime in the fiscal year beginning on April 1. If the developed world provides evid ence that financial conditions are tightening, the same cannot be said for the emerging markets.  The EMBI [Emerging Market Bond Index] spread was little changed and is at historically tight levels. Despite higher dollar rates,  the central banks of  Brazil and MexicoNovember 1, 20055 of 114have both been able to ease monetary policy—albeit from high levels—in recent days and weeks, as reflected in the bo ttom panels.  Brazil and Colombia have managed to issue local-currency-denominate d debt in the international market at attractive rates, as have some private bo rrowers in Asia.  This decoupling from policy rates in the major economies stands in  sharp contrast to previous cycles.  And to emerging market bulls, it reflects a better policy mix, higher reserves, and a strong global economy. As with emerging markets, the byword in domestic credit markets seemed to be “what, me worry?”  Despite some hi gh-profile bankruptcies in airlines, auto parts, and the surprise co llapse of Refco, credit market s were not flustered and took the news in stride. As shown in the top panels on page 3, both investment-grade and high-yield spreads moved only s lightly and remained at historically tight levels. The bankruptcies of Delta and Northwes t were dismissed, having been long expected. The Delphi bankruptcy was al so broadly expected.  And yet when it happened, protection for General Motors in  the CDS [credit default swap] market temporarily shot higher, as shown in th e middle panel.  The prospect that GM might have to absorb billions of dollars of additional pensi on costs got traders’ attention. Ford Motor CDS rates were al so affected.  But the broader Dow Jones CDX high-yield index—comprised of 100 single names—was little changed.  One collapse that was not expected was that of Refco, whose fraud was made public the morning of October 10 and wh ich filed for bankruptcy on October 17.  Refco is a small corporate bond issuer but  it does have linkages to firms across Wall Street.  All in all, the stress emanating from Refco was limited.  The rather busy graph at the bottom of page 3 depicts credit default swap rates for eight major financial firms since January.  Note  the temporary increase in the price of protection for these firms in the spring, when GM and Ford were downgraded and the so-called “correlation trades” began to go bad.  In contrast, the Refco news did not even register a blip in CDS rates. Overall, markets are posing something of a puzzle.  The rise in real yields and the fall in equity prices for most of Se ptember and October suggest a tightening of financial conditions. There were both  expected and unexpected bankruptcy filings. Yet both emerging markets and do mestic credit markets were unfazed, and money continues to seek higher-yielding assets.  Maybe  it really is different this time.  Then again, maybe the reaction will come with a lag that is longer than usual. Mr. Chairman, there were no foreign operations in this period.  I will need a vote to approve domestic operations.November 1, 20056 of 114CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Th ank you.  I notice that we still don’t endeavor to calculate the implicit 2- or 5-year break- even inflation rates—subtracting ou t the implicit CPI forecast from what the futures markets are telling us about energy prices to get in ferentially what the CPI ex food and energy would be if one presumes that the en ergy futures markets are arbitraged against the TIPS. MR. KOS.  I may be wrong, but didn’t we do— MR. REINHART. We have a cottage  industry, Mr. Chairman.    CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I don’t recall seeing any calculations recently.  MR. KOS.  I think this question came up about a year ago, and Vincen t was summarizing the work that had been done. MR. REINHART. What we do is take the energy futures curve, take th e weight in the CPI— CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Yes, but I never saw the result. MR. REINHART. Actually, Gover nor Ferguson saw something very similar just this week. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. That  still doesn’t answer my  question!  [Laughter] MR. REINHART. I guess the answer is that yo u do have a need to know, and you will!  [Laughter] CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Well, can you just give me a hint as to what  I’m going to learn? MR. REINHART. In previo us episodes, increases in  spot oil pri ces had brought the spot rate well above the longer-ahead futures rate, which im plied that market partic ipants were expecting inflation compensation to be goi ng down because of the anticipat ed decline in energy prices.  Relative to those episodes, this time around the curve is relatively flat, so you don’t have that.  And it’s a more permanent effect.  It affects the very near-term part of  the curve, but it’s a relatively small weight in  the total."
83,20051213,"December 13, 20054 of 100What, then, explains the dollar’s stre ngth?  The most compelling explanation— and this is tentative, I should say—appears to center  around the economy’s strength relative to other major economies.  That diffe rence in performance is , in turn, reflected in interest rate differentials, as shown on pa ge 2.  This page graphs the sovereign G-7 yield curve in green, the U.S. Treasury curv e in blue, and the G-7 curve excluding the United States in red. The composite yield curves are based on GDP weights for each country. At the beginning of 2004, U.S. short- term rates were lower than those of other major countries and the U.S. curve was steep er.  By the beginning of 2005, and with the tightening cycle here already well along, the entire U.S. yield curve had shifted above the others, as shown in the middle panel.  Th at interest rate differential continued to widen during 2005, with the prospect for furthe r widening if futures markets in the G-7 are to be believed. Of course, all that tells us nothing about the future course of exchange rates.  Perhaps growth and interest rate differentials will continue to drive exchange markets.  Or perhaps the current account will fi nally hit some threshold where a sharp depreciation is trigge red.  Unfortunately, reviewing past relationships does not help answer that key question. Turning to page 3 for a closer look at recent monetary policy expectations in the G-3, the top panel graphs the 3-month cash rate for the dollar a nd euro—in the solid blue and red lines, respectively—and 3-, 6-, and 9-month forward rates in the dashed lines. This graph depicts the widening of differentials betw een dollar and euro interest rates during the year. But it also shows the re cent uptrend in rates in the euro area, as the ECB finally tightened by 25 basis points earlier this month—although that uptrend was contained by the ECB’s deliberate attempts to signal that this was not the first of a string of moves along the lines  of the U.S. cycle.  Short-term rates from fo rward-rate agreements for Japan, shown in the middle panel, suggest some backing off from earlie r expectations about how quickly the Bank of Japan [BOJ] would enter a new tightening cycle, with 9-month forward rates falling about 10 basis points over the intermeeting period.  Although the BOJ has signaled an intention to exit its quantit ative easing policy in the s econd quarter of 2006, there has been substantial push-back from politicians.   Furthermore, the BOJ itself has said explicitly that even after the exit from quantitative targeting, short-term rates would stay at or close to zero  for some time afterward. Despite actual or expected further tightening of monetary policies in many countries, risk appetite remains robust.  As shown at the bottom of page 3, stock markets have rallied in most regions.  In f act, in local currency terms, the S&P has been the laggard. However, when converted into dollars, the returns on foreign markets are reduced, given the strength of the dollar;  and after that adjustment, the S&P’s performance looks a lot more like stock market performance elsewhere in the industrialized world. Emerging-market equity markets have been booming in localDecember 13, 20055 of 100currency terms.  And for specific mark ets such as Brazil and Mexico—whose currencies have appreciated— returns expressed in dollars have been  turbocharged.    Turning to page 4 and continuing on the th eme of healthy risk appetites, the top panel graphs the high yield and EMBI+ [E merging Market Bond Index Plus] spreads for the year to date. High yield spread s have stabilized at around 380 basis points— higher than levels observed last spring but still low by historical standards.  In contrast, since the last FOMC meeting, emerging-ma rket debt spreads—the green line—have continued to tighten to all-time lows.    Investment grade spreads—in the middle left panel—show a similar pattern.  Excluding the troubled auto and airline industr ies, corporate financial health remains strong. Earnings and cash levels are both hi gh, and leverage is relatively low.  That said, a bit of re-lev eraging is in the pi peline, judging by the increasing flows in LBO deals and announced stock buybacks. The big credit story in November, of c ourse, was the worsened outlook for GM.  CDS [credit default swap] spreads for GM, shown in the middle right panel, are now trading about 1200 basis points over Libor, compared to just over 300 basis points for the high yield CDX index.  Near-term prospect s for GM have deteri orated significantly, so much so that the credit yield curve for GM  has inverted.  In other words, it is more expensive to buy credit protecti on against a GM default in the next 12 months, than it is to buy credit protection against a GM default over the next 5 years.  In addition, sellers of CDS protection on GM have started to  demand up-front payment from buyers of protection. They are “front loading” their coupon payments  of the swap because of fears that GM will default before they have received any payments from protection buyers. The worries about GM were likel y reinforced by yesterday’s announcement from Standard and Poor’s that it had downgraded GM to single B. Recent declines in volatility in both equ ity and debt markets reinforce this low risk concept and are consistent with the str ong risk appetite in markets.  While the VIX has shown some periodic spikes this year, the movements this year are very small compared to historical changes.  Fixed inco me volatility is also low, as shown in the bottom right panel.    Turning to page 5, let me say a few words about the System Open Market Account [SOMA]. The top panel graphs the growth of SOMA in dollar terms for each year since 1995. So far, SOMA has expa nded by a bit more than $25 billion in 2005— somewhat less than the growth in recent year s.  The main driver of SOMA’s growth is growth of currency in circul ation.  As shown in the middle panel, currency growth— again, measured in dollars—has been trailing off in recent years and is likely to have its weakest year of growth since the late 1990s .  We don’t know the cause of that falling growth rate, although greater use of credit cards, debit cards, and other forms of electronic payment may at least pa rtly explain this development.December 13, 20056 of 100Looking at shorter periods, the bottom left panel graphs for 2005 the year-on­year growth rate for currency. Currency growth has decelerate d from a 5.5 percent growth rate at the beginning of the year to about 3.5 percent.  The noisy panel on the bottom right shows the growth of currency in  the year-end period for each of the past four years as well as this y ear through last week, with pr ojections for the remainder of this year in the burgundy dots. During the 2001 year-end—the blue line at the top— currency grew about 4 percent from November to the peak in late December before the reflows began. The following year the year-end seasonal bulge was less pronounced, and that pattern has continued in each year si nce.  Again, it’s not clear what is driving this process, but greater use of alternative forms of paymen t sounds reasonable.  In any case, the smaller hump in seasonal demand will, if it persists, make the management of reserves more straightforward in the future. Mr. Chairman, there were no foreign operations by the Desk.  I will need a vote to approve domestic operations.  CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  With respect to your  yield c urves on page 2, implicit there are  three observations fr om which you could presumab ly get what you’re trying  to get at, namely, some  form of weighted interest  rate differential for the three obser vations.  These do move the exchange rate. What happens if you take this back in time?  Is there any explanatory power in this  relationship? MR. KOS. I didn’t look at it that  closely.  I suspect that if one looks at the relationship over a long enough peri od, probably not a whole lot.  That’s a suspicion. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I thought we found approximately zero. MS. JOHNSON. This is a longstanding paradox in internationa l economics.  When you run uncovered interest parity and embod y the forward rate as the expected  future spot rate, you actually  get the coefficient with the wrong si gn in those regressions if the time  series is long enough.  And you never get it to confirm interest rate differentials related to exchange rates only in the positive direction and with the magnitude that you exp ected.  There are all sorts of reason s for that.  My s hort one is that you’re running two endogenous variab les on each other and, therefor e, the regression doesn’t make any sense, and so the resu lts don’t make any sense."

85,20060328,"With the increase in U.S. short- term rates and the stubbornness of the long end, the yield curve has stayed flat.  The bottom panel graphs the two- to ten -year spread since June 2004, or roughly when the tightening cycle began.  T he Chairman’s recent speech on the subject notwithstanding, market participants remain divided about the implications of  the flat, or slightly inverted , yield curve.    Turning to page 2, the economic news coming from Japan has been interpreted as pointing to an improved outlook.  Maybe it’s not a new era for Japan, but at a minimum it looks like a new chapter for the world’ s second largest economy.   The top left panel graphs the Bank of Japan’s current account balances since January 2001.  Just about five  years ago, the target current account balance (CAB) became the BOJ’s chief operating instrument.  Although required reserves have been in the range of 5 trillion to 6 trillion yen , the BO J successively raised its target for CABs to as much as 35 trillion yen.  Two weeks ago, the BOJ announced that it would end the quantitative easing policy and go back to targeting the overn ight call rate.  Most likely it will take about three  months for the BO J to drain the excess reserves in the system.  The call rate itself is expected to continue to trade near 0 percent well into autumn.  Among the factors that allowed the BO J to take this step were signs that deflation was ebbing and that bank lending was no longer contracting (as shown in the top right and middle left panels) .  Meanwhile, the health of the financial system  has improved, particularly that of the largest banks, as shown by the middle right panel, which graphs equity indexes  for the broad Topix and bank sub-index.  Along with forward rates, yields at longer maturities have also begun to reflect this improved picture.  The bottom panel graphs two - and five -year yields since 2 001.  The 2 -year Japanese government bond yields about 60 basis points—up from a low of about 3 or 4 basis points in 2002 and 2003.  Five- year rates have risen from about 20 basis points at the low to 1.25 percent.   The view is brighter in Europe as well, even if performance lags other regions.  European equities have risen broadly over the past fifteen  months, as shown  in the top panel of page 3.  Sovereign yields have risen, though there is still a gap with comparable U.S. yields.  The ten -year German b und yields about 3.65 percent, compared with  just above 3 percent six  months ago.  Meanwhile, there are signs of life in Germany —Europe’s largest economy—par ticularly in the export sector.  The improved business sentiment is reflected in the steadily rising  Ifo business survey in the middle right panel.    With G3 and other major economies such as Canada, China, and India all doing well, it’s not surprising that the overall market environment looks favorable.  In fact, one has to go far out in the periphery to find any signs of stress.  The bottom panel graphs the performance of selected currencies against the dollar through Friday’s close.  Besides the euro and yen for reference, the other currencies are those that have been mentioned as popular with the investors engaged in so -called carry trades.   In the past few weeks, some of these positions have been scaled back , and these currencies have weakened substantially in some cases.  Now let me confess that I March 27-28, 2006Authorized for Public Release4 of 167hesitated to include this chart.  The previous C hairman chided me once for showing a similar chart that included the New Zealand dollar—the currency of a country with a mere 4 million residents.  Well, I am probably skating on very thin ice with the new Chairman , now that the kiwi has returned along with that powerhouse the Icelandic krona, the currency of a country with about 250,000 residents or roughly one -tenth  the size of Brooklyn.  The point is not to suggest that Iceland is on the verge of joining the G7 but rather that the search for yield went to so me pretty distant and unlikely places—as we are now discovering.  It does raise questions about other sectors that leverag ed money went into and about which we don’t yet know.  The optimistic viewpoint is that carry trades in some of these peripheral marke ts have been scaled back without broader ripple effects —and that these markets have been repriced to levels that seem more appropriate.    On page 4, the top panel graphs the familiar emerging-market and high- yield spreads since the bull market began in Oct ober 2002.  The EMBI+ spread continues to narrow to new record  lows.  Reflecting that benign environment, Mexico and Brazil continued their easing campaigns, and Indian and Chinese equities continued to rally.  At the January meeting , I spoke about the bullish factors pushing emerging-market spreads lower.   Meanwhile the high-yield index has remained in a range and really hasn’t tightened further since early 2004.      The middle panel shows the rating composition of high- yield  issuance since 1988.  Issuance shot higher in 2003 and 2004— mostly to refinance, to extend maturities, and in general to repair balance sheets.  Very little of that was for investment.  Issuance fell sharply in 2005 and is running at that pace if one annualizes issuance for the first three months of 2006.  That issuance continue s to be  largely for refinanc ing debt and increasingly for  financ ing leveraged buyouts , acquisitions, payments of special dividends, and other forms of financial engineering.  Some of these are likely to show up as defaults in the future.    Meanwhile, actual defaults—as shown in the bottom panel—are low and show no signs of increasing.  Note that defaults typically start increasing a couple of years before the onset of recession, which is not surprising since the weakest corporations are less able to absorb a change in business climate.  So if a flat or inverted yield curve suggests possible weakness ahead, the low default rate for this sector is one indicator pointing the other way.    Turning to page 5, I have so me words about recent challenges regarding reserve management .  Besides the usual anticipation effects that we have seen in past maintenance periods when the market expected a rate hike at an FOMC meeting, the funds rate and our management of reserves in t he current maintenance period —which ends on Wednesday—was heavily influenced by reserve management at one large money center bank:  the Bank of New York.   In the top panel, the effects of the market’s expectation of a policy rate hike at this meeting are reflected in the smooth upward progression in the morning federal  funds March 27-28, 2006Authorized for Public Release5 of 167rate—shown by the blue circles.  At the start of this maintenance period, the funds rate in the morning was right at the current 4 ½ percent target.  Morning rates have risen steadily o ver the period, and this morning they stood right around the expected new target of 4 ¾ percent.  This pattern reflects the kind of gradual approach to the expected new target that we have seen in most maintenance periods since the start of the tightening cycle in June 2004.   Typically in these maintenance periods, the Desk has tried to lean modestly against the anticipation effects by providing relatively more reserves in the days before the FOMC meeting.  But in the current maintenance period, these efforts were overwhelmed by reserve management at the B ank of New York (B ONY), which had an unusually high level of requirements.   BONY’s high requirements—around $4 billion on a period-average basis both last period and in the current period—resulted from as-of adjustments applied in these two maintenance periods to compensate for its past underreporting of reservable deposits.  Its normal requirements are only around $100 million.  In anticipation of higher rates in the latter part of this maintenance period, BONY met virtually all its elevated requirements over the first four business days of the period and then held near zero balances over the remainder of the period.   BONY had indicated to us its intention of manag ing its reserve balances in this way.  But f or the first couple of days we only partly accommodated their increased demand, in large measure because the amounts seemed implausibly high and also because our experience has shown that banks’ stated intentions and actual behaviors don’t always line up.   Frankly, we were quite surprised at how inelastic BONY’s demand proved to be.  Its holdings i n the first couple of days effectively created a reserve shortage at all other banks in the system.  The funds rate soared late in the day on each of these days, even well above the expected new target level, and there was considerable borrowing at the primary credit facility.  Nonetheless, BONY sold very few reserves back into the market.   For the next couple of days, then, the Desk elevated its provision of reserves to fully accommodate BONY’s stated objectives for reserve holdings.  As a result, the funds rate was much less volatile and remained so for the rest of the period, even as morning rates tended to reflect more of the anticipation effects of the expected rate hike.   This episode illustrates the potential effect that just one bank with a large level of requirements can have on the entire funds market when it dramatically adjusts its reserve holdings in a very inelastic fashion.  If the Desk is aware of these plans and can have confidence that the bank’s actions will conform to its stated plans, then it can compensate in its provision of reserve supply.  But it may not always be possible to meet these conditions.   Mr. Chairman, there were no foreign operations in the period.  I will need a vote to approve domestic operations.

The People’s Bank of China raised the minimum lending rate that financial institutions can charge 27 basis points , to 5.85 percent, though I’m not sure that qualifies as a tightening for an economy with real growth in double digits.  The Bank of Japan is working to slowly bring down the current account b alances.  From about ¥30 trillion, balances have now been reduced to about half that level.  The BO J will continue to bring them down over the next month and then will likely maintain a buffer above required reserves for a period to give banks more time to adjust to the interest rate targeting framework that will follow.  As the middle panel shows, yen forw ard rates have continued to rise, and markets now presume that the BO J will bring the overnight call rate to 25 basis points sometime this autumn —but r umors circulat ed overnight that the first increase could come as early as July.   Those rumors fueled a rise of 9 basis points in two -year Japanese government bond yields and Euroyen futures.  The bottom panel graphs the two - and ten -year Treasury yields and the target fed funds rate.  Since the last meet ing, the ten -year yield has risen 34 basis points, and t he curve has steepened.  This is consistent with the ebbing of worries about a policy- induced slowdown.  The curve steepen ing was given a push by news, particularly the release of the minutes,  of a possible pause in the cycle.  Page 2 breaks down the incre ase in ten -year yields.  The top left panel graphs the real ten -year yield.  Real yields have risen about 40 basis points since early March and 14 basis points since the last FOMC meeting.  The top right panel graphs the ten -year breakeven  rate ( the blue line ) and five -year breakeven  rate five years forward  (the green line).  Both have risen since early April with the five -year forward rate rising somewhat more.  On a technical note, these are straight breakeven  rates without adjustments for carry.   The picture of rising real and rising breakeven  rates is also visible internationally —at least for those countries with inflation -linked bonds.  The middle left panel graphs the change in the real yield this year for France, the U nited Kingdom, and Japan.  Real y ields  have risen in all three by varying degrees.  The middle right panel graphs the change in their breakeven  rates.  All three have moved about 20 basis points so far this year —somewhat less than the 36 basis point increase for the United States.   Fuelin g the sentiment about inflation expectations has been the rise in commodity prices.  The bottom left panel graphs selected metal prices indexed from January 1.  Some of these are at record  highs or, in the case of gold , multidecade highs.  The right panel graphs the movement of energy prices so far this year.  The one outlier is natural gas, which rose sharply after Katrina  but fell back  when consumption did not meet forecasts because of  an unseasonably warm winter.   Let us t urn to page 3 and the other ele ment that has garnered substantial attention:  the recent weakness of the dollar.  After being stuck in a narrow $1.18 to $1.22 range, the euro appreciated out of that range in mid-April as sentiment turned against the dollar, as shown in the top left panel.  This morning it was  trading just below $1.28.  Meanwhile, t he yen appreciated from ¥118 to the dollar in early April to about ¥110.60 this morning.  It’s May 10, 20064 of 120tempting to conclude that the current account deficit is finally exerting itself on the exchange rate.  Call me skeptical , but I find it hard to believe th at markets awoke to the scale of the imbalances only when reading the now-famous annex in the G7 communiqué.  And yet that there was a shift in sentiment can be felt if not visibly observed.  One pla ce thi s shift in sentiment can be felt  is in options markets.  The middle left panel graphs one-month risk reversals , whe re dollar puts are bid relative to dollar calls, especially against the yen , and suggests that market participants are more concerned about further downside for the dollar.  Another view into this phenomenon is through interest rate differentials.  The middle right panel graphs the euro–dollar exchange rate and the differential between December 2006 Eurodollar and Euribor futures.  The tw o tracked pretty closely in 2005 and most of this year but started to diverge in mid -April , suggesting that the effect  of interest rate differentials on the exchange rate had lessened and , hence, that something else was  exerting greater force.     So what are some possible explanations for the shift in sentiment?  At the macro level, most forecasts have the United States  slowing down in the second half while Japan and Europe do not slow , even if in level terms the United States  is still growing faster .  Seco nd, the strong growth of the global economy is being interpreted by some in the leveraged community as increasing the odds that emerging Asia n countries in particular will allow a rise in their currencies —and hence less dollar accumulation—in the period ahead.  S ome countries are apparently struggl ing with steriliz ation of accumulated reserves .  A third explanation  is the continued nagging fear that central banks will diversify their dollar holdings.  During much of April there were rumors that a large cent ral bank —pre sumed to be from the Middle E ast—was selling dollars.  Whether that’s true or not, I don’t know.  However , it is true that a central bank from Europe—the Swedish Riksbank—was in the midst of lowering its dollar holdings, eliminating its yen holdings, and increasing holdings of European and other currencies.  The Swedes made their changes public on April 21.  Whether other central banks will follow is an open question; but analysts have noted the prisoner’s dilemma that the large holders of dolla rs face on this question of diversification, and it is one the markets focus on intensely and are acutely sensitive to .  Finally, the markets noted the Treasury’s report on foreign holdings of U.S. securities for the year through June 2005 and the unfavorable revisions it contained.  This report corrects the estimations in the monthly TIC data.  Whereas the TIC data reported that private investors were the large buyers in that twelve -month span, it now turns out that private demand was minimal and that most of the buying was by official accounts.     The bottom panel charts the appreciation against the dollar by a range of currencies in the intermeeting period.  Several of these are commodity based, but many are not.  And even some of the currencies I talked about last time that had been caught in the liquidation of carry trades made strong comebacks.  Yes , even the Icelandic krona, which fell another 10 percent after your last meeting , has reversed course and, on balance, has risen slightly since March 28.  I should note that the Canadian dollar is at its strongest level against the U.S. dollar since 1977.  Besides the positive terms -of-trade shock, the Canadians have both strong growth  and low inflation and  something we don’t have:  a current account surplus and an ongoing budget surplus that is being used to pay down debt.  May 10, 20065 of 120Changing pace a bit, if you turn to page 4, the top panel graphs the evolution of required operating balances since 2001 and the target fed funds rate.  Required operating balances (ROBs) have fallen sharply as the opportunity cost of holding demand deposits has risen.  From a peak of about $23 billion, required balances have fallen to about $15 billion.  Significant changes in the level of ROBs have been associated with changes in fed funds rate volatility because lower levels of such balances  give banks less scope for absorbing daily shocks to their reserve holdings at the Fed.  Meanwhile, a lower level of ROB s provides the Desk with less scope to manage the funds rate by adjusting the daily reserves supplied without forcing banks either to borrow at the discount window or to accumulate unwanted excess reserves.  So far the effect  of the decline in required operating balances has been muted , and we do have some experience in operating in such an environment from the last time that required balances were at such levels in the late 1990s and the early part of this decade.   Finally , I want  to inform the Committee that the Desk has just finished implementing a new electronic trading system that we call FedTrade and through which we conduct open market operations with the primary dealers.  This system replaces a legacy mainframe system that was inflexible and no longer suited our needs.  The bottom panel lists some of FedTrade’s main features .  Mr. Chairman, there were no foreign operations.  I will need approval of domestic operations.  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  On the rise in inflation breakeven s since our last meeting, do you have a sense about the breakdown between carry effects , expectat ions, and risk premiums? MR. KOS.  Well, as somebody said in  another setting just the other day, risk premiums are something we don’t know a lot about, and they are difficult to disentangle.  I haven’t done the exercise, but with energy prices rising , I don’t know that the carry effects have been huge.  MR. REINHART.  T he carry effects are going to matter only for the first part of it.  And as we noted in the Bluebook, at the time we had an  increase in inflation compensation  of about 15 basis points.  Most o f it was related to energy prices.   If you think about the term structure of energy futures, they actually tilt down at the far end, and so that would go the wrong way.  S o everything in terms of the rise in the five- year-ahead  five-year forward rate would be inflation compensation.  If you go to our May 10, 20066 of 120"
87,20060629,"about so-called crowded trades, which is code for widespread participation in relatively illiquid markets where the exit door is pretty small.  Emerging  market  equities and commodities were probably the best examples of this phenomenon.  A variant explanation centers not so much on technical factors and positioning but rather on the lagged effect of the withdrawal of so- called excess liquidity as central banks worldwide tighten monetary policy.  I’ll come back to that as well.    As the top two graphs show, the U.S. equity market has been less interesting than some of its global counterparts, many of which have fallen by double digits over the past six weeks.  The S&P 500 in contrast has fallen about 6 percent since May 9.  The busy table at the bottom of the page lists those periods in which the S&P 500 has fallen 10 percent or more since 1942.  There have been twenty -nine such periods, or roughly once every  two or three years.  Viewed historically , the recent price moves are not unusual.  To drill down a bit into emerging  market  equities, please turn to page 2.  The top panel graphs the performance of equity markets in Brazil, India, Mexico, Russia, South Africa, Korea, and Turkey.  The blue bars graph performance for the period from January 2, 2006, to May 10.  The red bars graph performance from May 11 through yesterday.  The middle panel graphs, for the same countries, performance of their currencies  for the same periods.  The charts seem to support this notion of strong appetite for riskier assets earlier this year and then a sudden shift to reduce positions in riskier markets.  Of course, when volatility begins to rise, intermediaries such as investment banks show an increase in value at risk that they wish to reduce.  The process of reducing that risk only reinforces the trend in the short run, and assets that were thought to be uncorrelated suddenly start to move in unison.  The bottom panel graphs metal prices from January.  Like emerging  market  equities, metal prices rose on perceived strong fundamentals.  The momentum players jumped on board and gave prices a boost.  Prices peaked around mid-May, and as the risk-reduction phase kicked in, prices came down, though they are s till up for the year.   However , the risk -reduction story goes only so far.  It is evident in specific and fairly narrow segments.  It is not evident, or is only modestly evident, in other segments.  The top right panel on page 3 graphs the MOVE index of implied volatility on Treasury yields since January 2005.  Implied vol atility has  remained  at very low levels despite the excitement elsewhere.  In fact, as shown in the top left panel, although the VIX spiked to about 23 percent in mid- May, it quickly came off and is below its long- term average.   Similarly , although credit spreads are mildly wider, as shown in the bottom three panels, absolute levels remain generous and far below the levels observed last spring, when G eneral Motors’ announcement caused a sudden widening of spreads .  The bullish interpretation of the recent bout of volatility is that it has been limited to narrow sets of asset classes and could be compared with  last spring’s events , which did not have spillover effects outside the areas of credit derivative s and convertible arbitrage.  This view suggests that those assets that appreciated “too far too fast” June 28-29, 20064 of 177needed to revert to some notion of fair value and that there is no reason for broader effects.   The bearish case argues that too many inves tors have more risk on their books than they would like and will seek opportunities to sell into any rallies.  According to this view, the movements in Iceland and New Zealand in March were the precursor to May’s volatility in a broader set of markets, whi ch may be a precursor to subsequent price declines in more developed markets.  The top panel of page 4 graphs the three-month deposit rates for the dollar ( in red ) and for the euro (in blue), along with three -, six -, and nine-month forward rates since April 1.  With dollar forward rates essentially on top of each other, the markets are probing to locate the point at which the Committee will pause from the meeting -by-meeting pattern of tightening.  In contrast, the ECB is viewed as having further to go, as seen by the wider  spread between cash and forward rates.  Indeed, in the past few days ECB officials noted that the pace of tightening could be accelerated.   The middle panel graphs the evolution of current account balances at the Bank of Japan in blue and the overnight call rate in green.  CABs came down from about ¥30 trillion to the low teens over a two -month span.  However, in recent weeks the call rate has had sudden spikes toward the BO J’s Lombard -style lending facility , which is set at 10 basis points.  In response, the B OJ added reserves.  From a low of about ¥10 trillion in early June, CABs have risen to about ¥15 trillion , compared with  required reserves of about ¥5 trillion to ¥6 trillion , and yet the call rate remains stubbornly firm.  The bottom panel graphs the Japanese government bond yield curve from three months out to ten  years as of yesterday and a year earlier.  As shown by the green line, a year ago the money market curve was essentially at zero , and all rates out to two years were extremely low.  Arguably the weight of all those reserves in the system worked to push down more of the yield curve toward zero.  Now, as those reserves are being withdrawn, money market rates are no longer being held down.  So while the target call rate for the BOJ remains near zero, in reality conditions have tightened up.  Outside the G3, the story is similar:  Worries about inflation are leading to modest increases in rates.  Among the countries whose central banks tightened policy during the intermeeting period were Canada, Switzerland, Sweden, Turkey, South Africa, Korea, Thailand, and India.  Some, like Turkey, had fundamental and policy challenges they were addressing.  The linkage between monetary policy and asset markets is difficult to define and measure .  But those investors that take a more bearish perspective cite the tightening of policy  globally and the withdrawal of liquidity as risk factors going forward.  On page 5, the top panel graphs the two - and ten -year Treasury yields along with the target f ed funds rate ( in green ).  Yields had been hovering near the current funds target but moved toward 5.25 percent as the expectation of a ¼ point move at this meeting increased.     June 28-29, 20065 of 177The middle left panel graphs the ten -year breakeven inflation rate from TIP S and the five -year rate five  years forward.  After rising in April, the breakeven rate came off somewhat after the Chairman’s comments to the International Monetary Conference and subsequent comments by Committee members.  The middle right panel graphs those same two rates over a longer time frame.  Despite the attention that markets have given the rise in breakevens earlier this year, broadly speaking breakevens are very close to levels observed at the beginning of the tightening cycle two years ago.  The bottom panels graph the dollar’s exchange rate against the euro and yen.   The dollar has appreciated against both.  Although the broad fundamentals have not changed, the dollar may have benefited from safe haven effects and an unwinding of short dollar positions as hedge funds and others reduced risks in recent weeks.  Finally , I want to say a few words about our recent experiences with check float, especially given processing changes related to Check 21  (Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act) .  For the Desk, float tends to be a focus on Tuesdays largely because these are peak processing days.   Pronounced but episodic spikes in float began to appear last October.  The top panel on page 6 graphs the actual float (the gray bars) and our forecast for float (the red dot).  As we have been told, the major contributing factor to these behavior changes in float is a combination of hardware and software problems that have appeared in the processing of Check 21 files.  The challenge for the Desk is to forecast flo at and adjust reserve provisions appropriately.  At times in recent months we have been surprised by high levels of float that we did not forecast.  At other times we had the opposite surprise:  We were told to expect float that did not materialize.  For r eference, the middle panel graphs the same set of months in the year-earlier period showing lower levels of float, lower volatility of float, and important for us, less variation between the forecast and the actual.   But the important question is whether we can trace float to higher levels of funds volatility given the numerous other factors that can affect the supply of reserves.  The bottom panel tries to inform, if not fully answer, that question.  The dots represent the difference between the forecast and the actual float levels.  The y axis graphs the standard deviation of the funds rate on that date.  We have arbitrarily drawn a line at 20 basis points to demarcate a high-volatility day.  The blue dots represent observation in the year-earlier period.  They tend to show small forecast errors, and those dates were not associated with high levels of volatility.   The red dots cover the more recent period , and they show six observations with very large forecast errors, of which four were associated with high levels of fed funds volatility.  Thus, one shouldn’t exaggerate the effect  of Check 21 on Desk operations, but at the same time the effect  should not minimized either.  Mr. Chairman, there were no foreign operations in the period.  I will need a vote to approve domestic operations.  June 28-29, 20066 of 177"
88,20060808,"rates so far in 2006. Last Thursday the Bank of England surprised the market by increasing rates 25 basis poi nts, while the European Central Bank ratified expectations by also tightening 25 basis poi nts.  Of particular note among central banks that have recently raised interest rates is the Bank of Japan, which on July 14 moved the target overnight cal l rate from 0 to 25 basis points, as shown in the bottom panel. The move had been well telegra phed.  Nevertheless, the aggregate current account balance at the BOJ is still higher than required reserves of 5 trillion to 6 trillion yen. The main reason seems to be that Japan Post continues to hold high and variable balances, thus bumping up the aggregate.    While the backdrop globally is toward ti ghter monetary conditions, investors in the United States have been looking forward to a plateauing of s hort-term interest rates or even a decline over the medium te rm as housing and other indicators have weakened. The prospect of a pause in th e tightening cycle reportedly helped support equity prices, shown in the top panel on pa ge 3, which inched higher as this meeting approached. Corporate profits on the S&P 500 for Q2 have risen 19 percent, higher than analysts’ forecasts. In fact, profits have risen by double digits seventeen quarters in a row. With the prospect  of a pause and strong prof its, one might wonder why the price action in equities has been on the sloppy side.  The most common answer is that the outlook that companies are providing is  cautious, perhaps suggesting that the economy is softening more quickly than previously forecast.  Continuing on that theme, the middle panel graphs the two-year and ten-year Treasury yields and the target fed funds rate. Two-year and ten- year Treasury yields are down about 30 basis points, to about 4.9 percent, and roughly 35 basis points below the funds rate.  Such an inversion is common during an easing cycle but very rare during a tightening cycle. As shown in the bottom panel, br eakeven rates have barely budged since the last FOMC meeting.  The entire decline in nominal yields represents a fall in real rates. Taken at face value, this suggests  that investors may see lower real returns ahead, perhaps reflecting a bearish view of the economy.  However, that bearishness on the economy is not spilling over to an e xpectation that inflation will necessarily fall back. The top panel on page 4 graphs the Libor fixing rate for three- month deposits (the thick red line) and three-, six-, and nine-m onth forward rate agreements.  In recent days the nine-month forward traded through the cash rate, sugge sting—if one takes this literally—that the markets are beginni ng to contemplate an easing of policy in early 2007. This pattern is similar but not identical to what we observed in 2000, as shown in the middle panel.  After the Co mmittee raised the funds rate in May 2000— in what turned out to be th e last move in the cycle—forward rates began to decline even though the Committee continued with an asymmetric bias to tighten.  By September the forward rates had pierced cash ra tes.  Another similarity is seen with Eurodollar futures calendar spreads.  The bottom left panel graphs the difference between the December 2007 and the December 2006 Eurodollar contracts.  Late last year that spread turned negative, implying that market participants expected interest rates to be lower at the end of 2007 th an at the end of 2006.  After reversing somewhat, the spread turned sharply downward in recent months.  The bottom right August 8, 20064 of 158panel graphs the spread between th e December 2001 and the December 2000 contracts from late 1999 through September 2000.  The spread turned negative only with anecdotal reports of a sharp drop  in orders around September, which was roughly three months after the last tightening.    Shifting gears, I want to mention briefl y the transition on July  20 to the new PSR (payment system risk) policy.  The first major P&I (principal a nd interest) date under the new rules was July 25. Fannie M ae had to fund $40 billion in MBS P&I payments (net of payments to itself), and the transition went very smoothly.  One of the tools that GSEs developed to help fund their accounts on a timely basis on large P&I dates are term and overnight early re turns of fed funds sales.  Under these contracts, fed funds must be  returned to them earlier than the end-of-day deadline associated with standard fed funds sales,  usually between 9:30 a.m. and 11 a.m.  Rates on overnight ear ly-return fed funds have trad ed roughly 1 to 3 basis points below standard fed funds. Based on incomplete sampling, about 15 percent of the volume of brokered fed funds reported to the Desk and used to calculate the daily effective rate has been early returns.  The Desk is collecti ng and monitoring early-return fed funds data from the major brokers  to assess how this market develops and how early-return fed funds may affe ct the overall fed funds market. There were no foreign operations in the period, and I will need a vote to approve domestic operations. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. The tr ansition to the new PSR policy is good news. Are there any questions for Mr. Kos?  If not, we need a motion to approve operations.  So moved, without objection. We  turn now to the economic situation.  Mr. Wilcox.  MR. WILCOX.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Jack Brickhouse, the voice of the Chicago Cubs for more than thirty years, was more widely known for his knowledge of baseball than for his command of proba bility.  When a Cub w ould step into the batter’s box after an especially long string of hitless trips to the plate, Brickhouse would invariably declare, “He’s due.” Ev en we kids knew in our minds that Jack didn’t have it quite right on the probability  front, but in our hearts it was enough to keep us going. Some of you may remember that an employment report was released on the Friday after the June meeting, and that  time, we pretty much nailed it.  So I have to admit to having had a “Brick house moment” last Friday and wondering whether we were “due” this time for a real trainwreck.  But for a second time in a row, fate smiled, as it so rarely seems to do on macro forecasters.  So at the end of today’s meeting, I’ll be happy to pass the baton back to Dave Stockton but with a certain sense of guilt:  He’s really due. [Laughter] In fact, as we reported to the Board ye sterday, Friday’s labor market report came in very much as expected.  Private n onfarm payrolls increased an estimated 113,000 in July, virtually the same as the 100,000 we had been expecting, and the gains in August 8, 20065 of 158each of the previous two months were revised up by a modest 20,000.  The unemployment rate rounded up to 4.8 per cent, but unless we receive additional evidence of a more-rapid slackening of conditions in the labor market, we’re inclined to stick with our Greenbook trajectory for th e unemployment rate as well.  Overall, we made no material adjustments to our macro forecast in light of this news on the labor market.  Indeed, I would argue th at there was less news in the August Greenbook than met the eye.  The quick summ ary of the August projection is that the pressures on resource utilizati on look roughly the same to us as they did at the time of the June Greenbook, whereas the outlook for in flation looks just a shade worse.   Turning first to the issue of resource u tilization, the clearest  indication of our thinking in this regard is that the une mployment rate in the August Greenbook never deviates more than 0.1 percentage point from our forecast in the June Greenbook.  To put a very fine line on the matter, we nudged the path down ever so slightly over most of the forecast period, and that  call still looks about right to us, even in the wake of Friday’s report. Given an unrevised estimate of the NAIRU, the slightly lower level of the unemployment rate implies that the pressures on resource utilization are just a little greater in this  Greenbook than they were in the last one. At the same time, we have become a b it more pessimistic about the outlook for the growth of aggregate demand relative to potential over the next six quarters.  This slightly greater pessimism derives from seve ral considerations.  Most notably, starts and especially permits for the construction of single-family homes came in below our expectations in June, and we responded by taking our projection for residential construction down over the entire projecti on period.  In the June Greenbook, our projection ran above the simula ted trajectory from our pref erred model for starts, in recognition of the persistent  upside errors that model had been making.  Now, for what it’s worth, our judgmental forecast ha ppens to be in line with the simulation from that model that jumps off from the last  quarter of data.  Parenthetically, I might note that the simulations from that model did not revise greatly over the past six weeks. We still see the contraction in residential construction as moderate by historical standards but likely to be a little steeper than we  anticipated in June.  This time, we forecast that single-family starts  will bottom out at an annual rate of 1.43 million units, bringing the overall decline fr om last summer’s peak to 18 percent, still well shy of the declines that were registered in the ea rly 1980s and early 1990s but starting to be in the same ballpar k.  We also took on board the growth implications of the further run-up in oil pr ices since the June meeting, the somewhat lower level of household wealth implied by the downward-revised trajectory for house prices, and the likelihood that greater  inventory investment in the second quarter robbed a smidgen of growth from the future. All that said, the adjustments to our fo recast of resource utilization are pretty marginal.  More eye-catching were our revisions to top-lin e GDP growth, which averaged 0.5 percentage point  over the second half of th is year and 0.4 percentage point next year. But here, of course, the changes were driven by the adjustments we made to the supply side of our projecti on.  In its annual revi sion of the national August 8, 20066 of 158"
89,20060920,"The massive loss disclosed on Monday by a large hedge fund has had remarkably, almost suspiciously, little spil lover effects thus far.  But with political crises suddenly popping up in Hungary and Thailand, it may suggest that risks in some of these smaller, less-liquid market sectors such as emerging markets and commodities have risen. Overnight the Thai baht was slight ly weaker, Thai banks and markets were closed, and currencies and equity markets of neighboring countries  were, on balance, only marginally weaker.  Meanwhile in th e G3, markets have generally been calm, though recent moves suggest a more sober outlook for growth than had been priced in earlier this summer.    On page 1 of your handout, the top panel graphs the three-month Eurodollar deposit rate in black and the same rate th ree, six, and nine months forward in red since the beginning of the y ear.  In recent weeks, forward rates traded through the cash rate as assorted reports—especia lly housing and inflation data—convinced market participants that (1) the Committee would continue to hold the target funds rate steady for sometime longer and (2) the prob ability of an ease early next year was far more likely than a resumption of the ti ghtening cycle.  That  view was seemingly shared by investors in the Treasury market.  As shown in the middle panel, two-year and ten-year yields have been gently dec lining since the June m eeting.  The ten-year yield currently trades about 50 basis points  below the target funds rate—the widest negative spread since March 2001. Meanwhile, various measures of the yield curve have now been mildly inverted for se veral weeks—perhaps also reflecting the market’s view that a slowdown is in the o ffing.  The bottom panel graphs the straight ten-year breakeven rate and the five-year rate five years forward.  Both declined modestly since the last meeting, helped by in flation readings that did not repeat this spring’s elevated numbers and also by the m oderation of commodity prices in general and energy prices in particular. The view that growth may be less robust was reflected  in overseas markets as well. On page 2, the top panel graphs the calendar spread for interest rate futures between the December 2007 and the Decembe r 2006 contracts for the G5 economies since January 1. In recent weeks that spread  has, on balance, been declining slightly as markets have taken out tightenings that had been priced in for coming quarters.  Even in Europe, where the ECB has been  talking tough, market participants are reassessing what effect a U.S. slowdown w ould have on the ECB’s trajectory.  The middle panel graphs ten-year sovereign yi elds for the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and, as a proxy for the euro area, France.  Those yields rose during the first six months of the year and have retreated more recently.  While there is a story for each economy, the most recent sets of  data have been slightly less favorable, and forecasts for the next few quarters have been trimmed back.  Meanwhile, as shown by the middle right panel, U.S. a nd Canadian breakevens have declined slightly. In contrast, brea keven rates in the United Kingdom and France have risen somewhat.  Indeed, the ECB has repeated ly voiced concerns about rising headline inflation and the persis tence of that trend. September 20, 20064 of 132Japan is a somewhat special case.  Through midyear, forecasts for Japanese growth had been rising. Deflation was e bbing, loan growth was rising, and the BoJ opportunistically exited its quantitative easing policy in March and then exited the zero interest rate policy in mid-July.  However, as shown in the bottom left panel, yields could not get past 2 percent and then began to decline as data such as machinery orders disappointed  investors and led them to  question how fast the BoJ would raise interest rates. Then on Augus t 24, Japan released revisions to the CPI, which showed that inflation had been lower than previously reported.  Markets quickly pushed back the timing of future  call rate increases despite the BoJ’s assertions that the revisions  did not change its basic outlook.  Japan does have a nascent inflation-linked Japanese governm ent bond market.  The bottom right panel graphs the breakeven, which has fallen from about 1 percent to about 60 basis points.  As shown in the top panel of page 3, the entire JGB curve has shifted down since the last FOMC meeting.  One factor that has continued to work in favor of Japan’s export sector has been the exchange rate.  The ye n’s nominal value has been falling against most currencies in recent weeks and hit it s lowest level against the euro since the single currency’s launch. The middle pane l takes a much longer perspective on the yen; it graphs the real effective exchange rate since the beginning of the floating rate era. The real effective rate has been falling steadily since 2000 and is at its lowest level in more than 20 years despite the chronic trade and current account surpluses that Japan has generated in the interim. The bottom two panels on page 3 reflect th e recent volatility in commodity prices, with metal prices on the bottom left and energy prices on the bottom right.  Metal prices continue to fluctuat e but show some signs of having topped out for the time being. Energy prices, however, have made a round trip from where they were at the beginning of the year.  The retracing of prices has fed discussions about whether the so-called speculative premium in energy prices has now been taken out.  Certainly there are signs that speculators have been  exiting some of these positions.  Those signs are most visible for natural gas, whic h is something of an outlier in the bottom right. Last week’s sharp dec line in prices may have been related to the liquidation of positions by the large hedge fund that was closing out positions.  If the speculative money is being chased out, for natural ga s but also for other products, then perhaps energy prices now better reflect underlying fundamentals. Finally, I want to come back briefly to a topic I mentioned at the last meeting related to the nas cent development of an early-return fed funds market.  As background, fed funds contracts do not generall y dictate the timing of the return leg.  So, not surprisingly, most fed funds are retu rned to the lender late in the day.  The GSEs have been interested in developing an early-return facility to meet the principal and interest payment timetable given the ne w PSR (payment system risk) rules.  The data are sparse, and our conclusions are tentative, but I wanted  to give you a brief update. On page 4, the blue bar in the t op panel graphs daily volumes of regular overnight fed funds contracts. The smaller green bar represents overnight early-return volumes.  The black line shows the percentage of overall volumes represented by early returns. The time series starts on August 8, which is when data first became September 20, 20065 of 132available to us. This series does not include term trades wi th early-return provisions.  In general, early returns make up about 10 percent of overall volumes.  The middle panel graphs the effective rate  for those trades with earl y-return provisions in red.  The blue line is the 9:00 a.m. rate.  Early- return trades are transacted in midmorning and thus show a strong correlation with the 9:00 a.m. rate, generally trading about 2 basis points below regular funds .  Finally, as shown in the bottom panel, early-return trades have far less volatility. The reason for the lower volatility is primarily that these trades are executed in midmorning ra ther than during the late afternoon rush, when the funds rate often can move with large swings.  Getting back to the GSEs, they in fact have not been active users of overnight early-return fed funds.  They have, however, used term fed funds of up to a month maturity with early-return provisions timed to mature on the date of thei r large P&I dates.  For term rates, unlike for overnight trades, there is no rate concession. Mr. Chairman, there were no foreign exchange operations for the period.  I will need a vote to approve domestic operations. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Are ther e any questions for Dino?  President Poole. MR. POOLE. Does the early-return rate enter into the calculation of the effective rate for the day? MR. KOS. Yes, it does. MR. POOLE. It does, and therefore it affects the futures market trading. MR. KOS. Yes, it does affect it. Now, the e ffect that it has is fairly small—I think it’s less than 1 basis point overall. MR. POOLE. But should that volume rise, it could become quantitatively significant. MR. KOS. That’s correct—i t could.  Again, despite forecasts by some traders and brokers in the market, so far that has not happene d.  In part, it’s because the GSEs have been using term fed funds more than ov ernight funds for cost reasons. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Lacker. MR. LACKER. About early returns, obviously  what we care about as a Committee is the 24-hour rate. Therefore, in calcu lating and targeting that effectiv e rate, if that spread became September 20, 20066 of 132"
90,20061025,"highlights of the memo I circulated last week regarding management of  the System Open Market Account.   The short intermeeting period was relatively calm.  Hence, v olatility remains low and credit spreads tight, while some equi ty indexes  rose to multiyear highs.  Occasional rumors that a large hedge fund lost significant amounts of money betting that yields would rise did not dent the underlying sense of confidence or relative tranquility.   On the first page of the handout, t he top panel graphs the three-month deposit rate and the same rate three, nine, and fifteen months forward.  The longer- dated forwards —as reflected by the solid red line —have declined more than 75 basis points from early summer to early October as market part icipants priced in an easing of policy for early 2007.  Those expectations were heightened as GDP forecasts for the third quarter were consistently trimmed downward.  But having pushed forward rates too far, market participants were poorly positioned for t he reversal in past few weeks after a surprising Philadelphia Fed survey and comments by Governor Kohn and other Committee members were interpreted as suggesting that  policy would not likely be eased on the trajectory that markets had built in. Longer -dated forward rates still anticipate an ease late next year, but the magnitude of that easing has been scaled back.   Longer- term Treasury yields show a similar pattern , as indicated  in the middle panel.  The yield curve remains inverted , though less than it wa s a month ago.  With credit spreads remaining tight and credit quality favorable, there has been less agitation in markets that the inverted curve is sending a recessionary signal.   Meanwhile, breakeven inflation rates from TIPS paint a favorable picture, especially at short maturities given the fall in energy prices.   As shown in the bottom panel, the five-year breakeven continued to narrow, to about 2.10 percent, and has now contracted more than 50 basis points in less than three months.  Longer -term matu rities, which are less affected by short -run energy price moves, had less of a decline, as shown by the ten -year maturity.  Meanwhile the five-year rate five years forward —the red line—is little changed from the last FOMC meeting.   The prospect tha t polic y rates may have peaked plus  falling oil prices supported equity prices and trumped adverse factors such as evidence that economic growth had slowed.  As shown in the top left panel on page 2, the Dow Jones Industrial A verage finally pierced the 12,000 level to a new record  high.  Other major indexes , such as the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq —as shown in the top right panel—also rose , though they remain some distance from their record  highs.  One feature of the equity markets since the tightening cycle began has been the outperformance of so -called value stocks , as shown in the middle left panel. When economic growth is strong, value stocks—r epresented by the larger cyclical companies —tend to do better because their earnings are stimulated by the strong economy.   But since early August, coincident with the pause in policy tightening, the growth stocks have begun to outperform.  One interpretation is that, with economic growth slowing, the effect is biggest on cyclical companies , whose margins compress , whereas  growt h stocks are better able to maintain margins.  Another interpretation is that the equity markets are also pricing in October 24-25, 20064 of 203a peak in the tightening cycle on the theory that the Committee will not tighten into a slowing economy.  Finally, this generally benign pi cture is also reflected in the foreign exchange market.   The bottom panel graphs the dollar against a range of currencies since the last FOMC meeting.   None of these currencies moved more than 2 percent in either direction, and most are clustered within a band of 1 percent.   For what it’s worth, the currencies that appreciated tended to be higher -yielding currencies.  This pattern tends to support anecdotal reports that, in the absence of directional opportunities, carry trades continue to attract speculati ve flows.   Switching gears somewhat, I want to summarize the main points of the memo that I sent to the Committee last week about the domestic portfolio guidelines.  The last time that we systematically looked at the portfolio was in 1996.  We looked at it again in 2000 and 2001 in the context of considering alternative assets given that the Treasury market was shrinking and the Committee was faced with the prospect of acquiring private- sector assets.  The table on the right side of page 3 provides a recent snapshot of the System Open M arket Account.  Given the amount of time that has elapsed and the changed environment, we thought it would be timely to refresh our analysis and assess whether the principles we had been using to manage the SOMA portfolio still made sense.  I ndeed , we concluded that the four principles identified previously—safety, liquidity, market neutrality, and return—r emain appropriate given the objectives for SOMA.    Safety is the bedrock of a central bank balance sheet , and its importan ce is uncontrovers ial.  The Committee has achieved the goals embedded in this principle by maintaining  a portfolio of Treasury securities with no credit risk.  For years SOMA also held smaller amounts of agency and GSE (government-sponsored enterprise)  securities, but these were allowed to roll off.  The last GSE security in SOMA matured in 2003.  Somewhat more complicated is liquidity.  The Committee has discussed liquidity at various times in the past two decades.   In practical terms , the issue  is how fas t the Desk can offset a reserve -adding event , such as a large discount  window loan or a large foreign exchange intervention.   Our view is that the critical period for such operations is the short run.  Longer -term sterilizations will likely be slow and can  be managed in the normal course of reserve management operations.  As the memo describes —so I will not go into detail—our conclusion is that it is prudent to add a second limit or guideline of $80 billion of liquid assets over a three-month period  while k eeping the current $208 billion limit over a twelve -month period.  In practice, as shown in the bottom chart on page 3, SOMA maintains liquidity from maturing bills, coupons, and repos far beyond these minimums—a feature we will continue.  Additionally, th e Desk has other tools if needed in extr emis, as shown on the left side.  These include the ability to conduct reverse repos and, as a last resort, outright sales.  October 24-25, 20065 of 203The third principle is market neutrality , if you would turn to the next page.  This is also  somewhat complicated.  This issue is, in many ways, simpler now than it was six y ears ago , when the stock of Treasuries was declining.  At that time , we adopted a per issue limit structure , which is summarized in the top right panel of page 4.  In short, per issue limits of 35 percent were adopted for bills, which gradually declined to 15 percent for bonds.  The blue bars represent SOMA ’s holdings for each specific security.   This response was reasonable given the environment in 2000.  However , the limit s tructure has, in recent years, created situations in which we have had forced redemptions to stay within these limits, which in turn forces us to make additional outright purchases to offset those maturing assets .  We are therefore proposing to revert to an informal flat limit structure of 35 percent for all maturities.   I should note that this change would, in reality, have a very limited effect  on the portfolio given other restrictions that we have, and which I’ ll get to later.   At the margin it might  allow us to reduce our huge reliance on holdings at the short end of the curve.  We are somewhat underrepresented in the middle of the curve.  An associated issue I wanted to raise is SOMA ’s auction participation.  Our participation can be highly variable.  T here are two factors that we cannot control.   First, the Treasury ’s auction calendar is itself variable and dependent on fiscal needs.   Second , the Desk cannot participate in auctions unless it has securities maturing that very day.  The middle right panel shows this variability.  The yellow box highlights SOMA’ s anticipated participation for the three -year note in the next three refundings.  We anticipate taking down $6.1 billion in November, $1.5 billion in February, and then $6.0 billion in May.  Why is this important given that we are an add- on in the auctions ?  The Fed ’s holdings are part of the floating supply, which can influence the way an issue trades in the repo market.  This can, I hope, be seen in the bottom panel.  Our participation in the five -year note went from quarterly participation to monthly when the Treasury shifted from a mid- month settlement to a month -end settlement.   SOMA’ s participation is the green bar.  The change allowed us to smooth out our participation because we had large amou nts of two -year notes maturing at month end.  The black line represents the specialness spread in the repo market for each issue.   Note that this spread has been  much smaller in recent months , when SOMA’ s holdings have been  both steady and available to be lent.  Our preference for steady and consistent auction participation is, however, constrained by restrictions on how we invest maturing proceeds and, of course, by changes the Treasury makes to the auction calendar.  In short, we are likely to continue to wrestle with this principle for some time .  The last principle very briefly is return.  In our view, this principle should not drive the way SOMA is managed , given that our profits are derived from interest on our Treasury holdings and in turn flow back to the Treasury.    Mr. Chairman, there were no foreign operations during this period, and I will need a vote to approve domestic operations.  Helen and I would be happy to answer any questions.

91,20061212,"being weaker than expected.  This encouraged market participants to price in lower policy rates for the first half of 2007.  If you would turn to the handout, the top panel on page 1 graphs the Eurodollar futures strip  out to 2010 as of the last FOMC meeting, in blue, and as of last Friday, in red.  Near- term contracts declined less than 20 basis points, whereas longer -term contracts fell mor e than 30 basis points.  Until Friday’s employment report, future short- term ra tes were even lower , as the markets had come to expect that the weaker housing, auto, and manufacturing data would persist and lead to a first- quarter easing of policy by the Commi ttee.  Interestingly , the markets shrugged off the Chairman’s speech on November 28 and other comments by Committee members that focused more on inflation risks.  Indeed, in this period the markets were focused more on data—e specially data that seemed to validate a view  that the economy was slowing—than on speeches.    Longer -term yields also declined.  The middle panel graphs the target fed funds rate, the green line, and two -year and ten -year Treasu ry yields since January 2006.  Both t wo-year and ten -year Treasury yields tracked the upward path of the target fed funds rate but began to fall almost to the day that  the target peaked.  Ten -year yields have fallen another ¼ percent since the last meeting and are now about 75  basis points below the target fed funds rate.  This is the largest inversion of this spread since February 2001, when that easing cycle began .  As shown in the bottom panel, breakeven inflation rates are little changed and, if anything, have tended to rise at shorter tenures .  Most of the decline in nominal rates was mirrored by a fall in real rates as market participants factored in lower activity in the period ahead.    Despite reminders in Committee members’ speeches about upside inflation risks, market participants increasingly focused on the probability that policy would be eased in the months ahead.  This can b e seen in the top panel on page 2, which graphs the calendar spread between the March 2008 and the March 2007 Eurodollar futures contracts.  Back in May these two contracts were on top of each other, but then they gradually inverted, implying that rates we re expected to be lower in March 2008 than in March 2007.  Market participants anecdotally refer to past episodes when the Committee has eased policy several months after its last tightening as weakness in output began to show through.  Two episodes are frequently cited:  late 2000 and early 1995.  The middle panel graphs the calendar spread between the March 2002 and March 2001 contracts.  That relationship began to invert about five months after the last tightening , in May 2000.  The negative inversion peaked at about 50 basis points in late 2000, and the Committee eased policy in early 2001—the first of a long series of cuts.   The mid -1990s episode is somewhat different in that the yield curve and Eurodollar calendar spreads flattened but never convincingly inverted, as shown in the bottom panel.  Five months after the last tightening in Februar y 1995 came an ease in July.  In short, at least as measured by futures spreads, the expectation for an upcoming ease appears to be even stronger than in the previous two episodes.    December 12, 20064 of 134Equity markets have been undaunted by the signs of weakness that the bond market is responding to.  As shown in the two top panels on page 3, the major equity indexes  have had strong rallies since midyear.  The prospect of lower interest rates has trumped the possible slowdown in earnings growth that might emanate from a weaker economy.   Indeed even a weaker dollar has not dented confidence of either equity or fixed-income investors.  If anything, a gradually falling dollar is seen as a positive for large internationally oriented stocks such as those in the Dow or S&P indexes .    After being confined to a narrow range, the dollar depreciated rapidly against most major currencies in late November and early December.  As shown in the middle  left panel, the euro rose  above $1.32 while sterling looked poised to threaten the $2 level before consolidating near $1.96.  Sterling is at its highest value versus the dollar in more than fourteen  years.  The dollar’s movements against the yen have been  more range -bound as capital flows out of Japan have limited the yen’s appreciation.   The recent lurch in the dollar reflects improved sentiment toward European economies.  It also followed some comments by a Chinese official around Thanksgiving that were in terpreted  as conveying worries about continued accumulation of dollars among Asian central banks.  Reports of diversification by other central banks have fed this rumor mill.  Yesterday a prominent former member of this Committee weighed in by suggesting  that the dollar had further to go on the downside and that central banks should not concentrate their reserves in one currency.  Surveys of investors and speculative traders suggest that short dollar positions are at something of an extreme by historical standards.   Such negative sentiment is also borne out by risk reversals, as shown in the bottom right, which show that dollar puts are consistently bid relative to dollar calls  and have become more so recently .  Of course, once sentiment gets extreme, the market becomes susceptible to sharp setbacks.  Indeed, exactly two years ago , the euro appreciated dramatically into year -end peaking at $1.36, only to have all those gains fully reversed in the early months of 2005.    As shown on page 4, volatilities continue to trade at very low levels.   The top panel graphs the one- month implied volatility for the two major dollar currency pairs.  Since April/May , volatilities have fallen to new lows.  Similarly, in the middle panel, the VIX (Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index) has fallen back to levels last seen a decade ago.  In the Treasury markets, implied volatility is at or below levels seen in the summer of 1998.  With volatilities low and expectations of a benign environment persisting, dealers conti nue to report interest in carry trades and sales of structured products with embedded options.    One symptom of the benign financial environment that analysts point to is the higher level of mergers and acquisitions activity in general and leveraged buyouts  in particular.   The top panel on page 5 graphs the rise of LBOs since their nadir in 1992.  The middle panel deconstructs the high -yield  bond market according to how the proceeds were used.  The red bar —representing proceeds being used to finance M&A and LBOs —has been  rising  in the past three years.  Also rising has been the value of December 12, 20065 of 134bonds rated CCC or less at the time of issuance.  In short, t he market has been more than willing to finance lower -rated paper for purposes other than traditional investment in plant and equipment.  It is fair to say that r isks are rising.   But the development graphed in the bottom panel is in some ways more interesting .  This is the rise of the so- called leveraged -loan market, which exceeds amounts raised in the high- yield  bond market, represented by the y ellow line.  As shown by the blue bars, the portion of such loans originated by or syndicated to nonbank investors such as pension funds or hedge funds has risen and now exceeds the amount taken down by the banks.  P rivate equity sponsors are i ncreasingly turning to this source of funding to finance acquisitions.  Meanwhile private equity deals are also evolving.  The size has obviously grown, but two other aspects are worth noting.  First, many deals no longer involve acquis itions of underperforming companies.  In many cases the acquired companies are performing reasonably well but are viewed as being able to operate with higher levels of debt.  It’s not clear what value added the private equity buyer is providing in such cases.   Second, LBOs are no longer being done solely in industries with predictable cash flows.   Several deals were recently announced in volatile businesses such as semiconductors.  The poster child for such deals is Freescale Semiconductor.  The company was  just acquired for $17.6 billion.  Cash flow barely covers interest payments, and the margin for error is very small for a company in a notoriously volatile industry.   Cynics argue that tomorrow’s nonperforming loans are being originated as we speak.   Mr. Chairman, I am happy to say, once again, that there were no foreign operations in the period.  I will need a vote to approve domestic operations.  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Dino, some work here at the Board suggests that a good portion of the decline in the long- term rates in the intermeeting period was due to a falling term premium as opposed to expectations of inflation.  Is that consistent with what you’ve seen?  MR. KOS.  Yes, I think that’s correct.  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  And the reason for a lower term premium?  MR. KOS.  If I could answer that question, I’d be rich by now.  [Laughter]  I t’s hard to know.  I don’t pretend that I can give you a precise answer.  C ertainly, t he markets have been in this benign situation for some time, and we’ve been st ruggling with this question for several December 12, 20066 of 134"
92,20070131,"CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Are there any questions or comments?  Approved without objection.  Next on the agenda is a proposed change to Committee rules.  We received a memo fr om Scott Alvarez and Debbie Danker, which concerns how a backup would be appointed in case the Desk Manager was unable to serve.  Are there any questions for our colleagues on that memo?     MR. POOLE.  I have a question.  It has nothing to do with the changes, but something struck me this morning as I was reviewing this material again.  Let me refer you to the FOMC’s Rules of Organization, page 1:  “If a member or alternate ceases to be a president  or first vice president of a Reserve Bank, a successor may be chosen in a special election by the board s of directors of the appropriate Reserve Bank or Banks and such successor serves until the next annual election.”  Now, if Jack Guynn, for example, had retired last year in March, Atlanta had filled the position , and a president had been in place as of September, let’s say, would he have come back?  T his says “no” because it says “ until the next annual election. ”  Am I reading that wrong?  I’m not sure that has been even the practice in the past.  MS. DANKER.  Ou r General Counsel can probably comment on that, but I can try.   MR. ALVAREZ.  There’s a little lawyer in all of us.  [Laughter]   MS. DANKER.  I believe the election that statement refers  to is if a new p resident is appointed and that person is then elected as a member  by the boards of directors of the three Reserve Banks, he or she would serve until the next annual election  at this time of year , at which point the successor would be elected from one of the other Banks.  MR. POOLE.  Then I was not reading i t correctly ; but you understand where my confusion came from.  MR. ALVAREZ .  That’s exactly right.  January 30-31, 20074 of 255MR. POOLE.  Okay.  So the alternate would serve until the next president was in office.   That has certainly been the practice; my  question was about the wor ding.  Thank you.   CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Are there o ther questions about the memo?  I need a vote.  In favor?   Opposed?  Thank you.  Third, we need to select a Federal Reserve Bank to execute transactions for the S ystem Open M arket Account.  Governor Kohn, would you like to make a proposal?  [Laughter]   MR. KOHN.  I nominate the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, once again.  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Comments?  Objections?  Without objection.  The fourth item is that we need to select the Manager of the S ystem O pen Market Account.  Governor Kohn.  MR. KOHN.  I’d be very pleased to nominate Bill Dudley as the Manager of the S ystem Open M arket Account.  MR. FISHER .  You have to put your head down, Bill.  [Laughter]  MR. POOLE .  Second.  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Without objection.  Thank you.   VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER .  I think we should rule out humor.  [Laughter]   This is an important annual process, and New York plays an important role.   MR. REINHART .  So it will not say “laughter” in the  margins .  [Laughter]   CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.

Bill, you’re up.  MR. DUDLEY.1  Thank you.  In terms of market developments, I would like to focus on three major topics .  First is the sharp adjustment in marke t expectations concerning monetary policy since the last FOMC meeting.   Second, I will talk about the persistence of high risk appetites in credit markets, with a focus on what may be the most vulnerable market in the United States —the subprime mortgage se ctor.  Third, I want to discuss the possible factors behind some of the sharp shifts we have seen in commodity prices since the last FOMC meeting, in particular whether these price movements reflect a shift in risk appetite among noncommercial investors or fundamental developments in supply and demand .  First, there has been a sharp shift in market expectations  with respect to interest rates  since the last meeting.  At the time of the December meeting, the consensus view among market participants was that t he FOMC would begin to lower its federal funds rate target this spring and that this easing process would continue into 2008, with cumulative rate cuts of about 75 basis points.  As  you can see in chart 1, which looks at the federal funds futures market, and chart 2, which looks at the yield spreads between the March 2008 and the March 2007 Eurodollar futures contracts, expectations have shifted very sharply over the past month.  There is now no easing priced in through midyear 2007 and a residual of only a bout 25 basis points of easing priced in beyond that.  This shift in expectations can also be seen across the Treasury yield curve.   As chart 3  shows, the Treasury yield curve is now slightly above where it was at the time of October FOMC meeting.  Since the December FOMC meeting, there has been a rise of about 35 to 40 basis points in yields from two -year to thirty -year maturities.   The shift in expectations is reflected predominately in real interest rates.   As can be seen in chart 4, breakeven inflation rates have not changed much since the last FOMC meeting —the decline in breakeven rates that occurred early in the intermeeting period has been reversed more recently, and so we are at or slightly above where we were at the December meeting .  This upward shift in real rates appears to reflect a reassessment by market participants not only about the near- term path of short- term rates but also about what level of real short -term rates is likely to prove sustainable over the medium and longer term. The buoyancy of the recent activity data may have caused some market participants to reassess what level of the real federal funds rate is likely to prove “neutral ” over the long er term.   Regarding the issue of risk appetite, there appears to be no significant change since the last FOMC meeting.  Risk appetite remains very strong.  Corporate credit spreads remain very tight —especially in the high -yield sector  (as shown in c hart 5)—and implied volatilities across the broad market categories —equities and interest rates (see c hart 6) and foreign exchange rates (see chart 7)—remain unusually low.  Moreover, the turbulence in some emerging debt and equity markets experienced                                                  1 Material used by Mr. Dudley is appended to this  transcript (appendix 1).

93,20070321,"represent the cost of default protection on a basket of collateralized debt obligations that are backstopped mainly by subprime mortgages.  As shown in e xhibit 3, although this widening has been most pronounced at the bottom end of the credit quality spect rum (BBB-minus and BBB), it has rippled upward to the higher- rated tranches that are better protected.  Exhibit 4 shows how the credit deterioration initially registered in the ABX index es as market participants sought to buy protection.  In milder form, this deterioration also registered in the underlying collateralized debt obligations and asset- backed securities.   The widening of the credit spread in the ABX indexes  was probably exaggerated by the fact that there was an asymmetry between the many that  were seeking loss protection and the few that were willing to write protection.  This can be seen in two ways.  First, as shown in e xhibit 4, the spread widening was more pronounced in the ABX index than in either underlying collateralized debt obligations or asset -backed securities.  Second, as shown in e xhibit 3, the ABX spreads have come down a bit from their peaks even as the underlying market for subprime mortgages, as reflected in the ongoing viability of many mortgage originators, has continued to dete riorate.      The deterioration in the subprime market has undermined the economics of subprime mortgage origination and securitization.  This is especially true for those mortgage originators with poorer underwriting track records.  Their loans can no longer be sold at a sufficient premium  to par value to cover their origination costs.  In addition, the costs that they must incur to replace loans that have defaulted early have increased sharply.  In several cases, these difficulties have caused banks to pu ll their warehouse lines of credit.  Several of the large monoline originators are bankrupt, distressed, or up for sale—they are highlighted in red in exhibit 5 .  Moreover, several of the diversified lenders, such as HSBC, have indicated that they are tightening credit standards and pulling back from this sector.  The result is that the volume of subprime mortgage originations is likely to fall sharply this year —perhaps dropping one-third or more from the 2006 rate of slightly more than $600 billion.  This tightening of credit availability to subprime borrowers is likely to manifest itself through a number of channels .  These channels  includ e (1) a drop in housing demand, as borrowers who would have been able to get credit in 2006 no longer qualify under now toughened underwriting standards; (2) a n increase in housing supply, as the rate of housing foreclosures increases (n otably, the Mortgage Bankers Association reported last week that the rate of loans entering the foreclosure process in the fourth quarter of 2006 reached a record level of 0.54 percent, the highest level in the history of the thirty- seven -year-old survey ); and (3) a dditional downward pressure on home prices, which in turn threatens to increase the magnitude of credit problems, delinquencies, and foreclosures.    In considering these channels, it is important to emphasize that the credit strains in the subprime sector are unlikely to have peaked yet.  The reset risk on the adjustable- rate portion of the subprime loans originated in 2005 and 2006 will be felt mainly over the remainder of 2007 and 2008.  Most of the adjustable- rate loans are fixed for two  years at low “teaser” rates.  When yields adjust upward once the teaser rate period is over, some borrowers may have in sufficient resources to service these March 20-21, 20074 of 196debts.  The good news— at least to date —is that spillover into the a lt-A mortgage and conforming mortgage areas is very mild , both in terms of credit spreads and in terms of loan performance.  Although there has been some rise in delinquency and foreclosure rates for higher -quality residential mortgages, these rates are still low both qualitatively and historically .  Moreover, there is little evidence that the subprime problems have hurt mortgage loan volumes.  For example, the Mortgage Bankers Association index of mortgage applications for purchase has increased in the past three weeks.   Turning next to the U.S.  equity market, it is less clear -cut whether the decline in prices and the rise in volatility are fundamentally based.  As several observers have noted, equity valuations do not appear to be excessive.  If that is the case, then why have equities been more turbulent than corporate and emerging -market  debt , for which  spreads remain unusually narrow?  Although this point is legitimate, two  fundamental developments that make U.S.  equity prices less attractive deserve mention.  First, equity analysts have been reducing their earning s forecasts for 2007.  Although the top-down view of the equity strategists for the S&P 500 index has not changed much, on a bottom-up basis, earnings expectations  have dropped sharply.  As shown in exhibit 6, the aggregate forecasts of the individual sector analysts now indicate a growth rate in S&P 500 earnings for 2007 of about 6 percent , down from about 9 percen t at the beginning of the year.  In contrast, S&P 500 earnings have grown at an annual rate of more than 10 percent  for four consecutive years.  It should be no surprise that falling earnings expectations could weigh on equity prices.  Second, uncertainty about the growth outlook has increased.  This shows up clearly, for example, in our most recent primary dealer survey.  Because greater uncertainty about the growth outlook presumably implies greater risk, the rise in uncertainty should—all else being equal—r esult in lower share prices.   In contrast, it is easier to explain the modest widening of corporate credit spreads.  In theory, lower share prices and higher volatility imply a greater risk of default , which should imply wider credit spreads.   Corporate credit spreads have behaved in a manner consistent with this.  Josh Rosenberg from the research group at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York recently investigated this issue.  He found that the spread widening in the high-yield corporate debt sector was consistent with past periods in which the implied volatility for equities rose sharply.  Exhibit 7 summarizes one key result.  The widening in the BB- rated corporate spreads in the week after  the February 27 retrenchment was of a magnitude similar to that of other instances in which implied equity- price volatility as measured by the VIX index rose sharply.  In the most recent episode, the VIX index rose 848 basis points, and the BB corporate spread rose 27 basis points.  This rise compares with  an average rise of 21 basis points in the BB spread in the ten cases in which the VIX rose most sharply.  The rise in the most recent episode is well within the range of historical experience.     In many other areas in which asset prices have moved sharply, risk -reduction  efforts appear to have played the biggest role.  For example, in the foreign exchange markets, the biggest currency moves were in the currency pairs associated with so -called carry trades, such as the yen and Swiss f ranc for the low -yielding currenci es March 20-21, 20075 of 196and the Australian and New Zealand dollar for the high yielders.  Exhibit 8 indicates the change in the y en versus the Australian dollar, the New Zealand dollar, the euro, the British pound, and the U.S.  dollar during three separate periods—the week before the February 27 stock market selloff, the week of the stock market selloff, and the past two weeks.   The high- yielding currencies appreciated the most during the run -up to the February 27 selloff, fell the most during the February 27 week, and have recovered the most against the yen over the past two weeks.  The changes in speculative positioning in foreign exchange future markets tell a similar story.  Exhibit 9 shows the change in the share of the open interest position held by participants in the noncommercial futures market.  Over the past few weeks, net short positions as a percentage of the overall open interest in the yen have dropped, and long positions in the British pound and Australian dollar have dropped.     An examination of how Treasury yi elds, stock prices, exchange rates, and credit spreads have moved also indicates that risk -reduction  efforts have been important.  Exhibit 10 shows the correlation of daily price and yield movements in 2007 before February 27.  As one can see, the correlat ions were quite low.  In contrast, the correlation matrix in exhibit 11 shows the correlation of daily price moves for the period beginning on February 27.  Most of the correlations have climbed sharply, suggesting that risk positioning is driving price and yield movements.  Finally, short- term interest rate expectations have shifted substantially since the last FOMC meeting.  As shown in exhibit 12, near- term expectations have shifted, with market participants now expecting a modest reduction in the federal funds rate target by late summer.  However, the federal fund s rate futures curve is still above the curve at the time of the December FOMC meeting.  In contrast, longer -term expectations have shifted more sharply, with a larger move toward easing.  As shown in exhibit 13, the June 2008/June 2007 Eurodollar calendar spread is now inverted by about 60 basis points.  This calendar spread is more inverted than it was at the time of the December 2006 FOMC meeting.    Compared with  the shift in market expectations, the forecasts of primary dealers have not changed much.  Exhibits 14 and 15 compare dealer expectations with market expectations before  the January FOMC meeting and before  this meeting.  The horizontal bold lines represent market expectations.  The bl ue circles represent the different dealer forecasts.  The green circles represent the average dealer forecast for each period.  The two exhibits illustrate several noteworthy points.  First, the average dealer forecast has not changed much since the Januar y FOMC meeting —the green circles in the two charts are in virtually the same position.  Second, the amount of dispersion among the dealers’ forecasts has not changed much—in fact, the range of the blue circles is slightly narrower currently.  Although many dealers now mention that their uncertainty about the growth outlook has increased, that  does not appear to have been reflected in their modal forecasts.  Third, there is now a substantial gap between the dealers’ average forecast and market expectations —the gap between the horizontal bold lines, which represent market expectations, and the green circles, which represent the average dealer ’s view, has increased.  Why is there a large gap March 20-21, 20076 of 196"
94,20070509,"remain much wider than earlier in the year.  Also, note that ABX spreads remain considerably wider than the CDS and cash spreads that they reference.  This situation underscores the illiquidity of the ABX market and may partially reflect the lack of a natural constituency of investors who might wish to take the long side of this index, especially when the subprime market is under stress.  The problems in subprime mortgages have spilled over into the c ollateralized debt obligation (CDO) market.  As you may recall, many CDOs have a substantial proportion of their assets in lower-rated subprime asset -backed security tranches.  After widening sharply in late February, the yield spreads on mezzanine structured -finance CDOs have shown no recovery.  In fact, as shown in exhibit 7, the spreads on these CDOs have continued to widen.  At the last FOMC meeting, I argued that the selloff in the equity market that began in late February had at least one fundamental component—the reduction in earnings expectations for 2007.  Yet the equity market has recovered quite strongly .  I think that this can be explained by three factors.  First, earnings in the first  quarter were stronger than expected.  The Board staff estimates that first- quarter earnings for the S&P 500 will have increased about 9 percent  on a year -over-year basis.  Second, perhaps as a result, earnings expectations have stabilized.  As shown in exhibit 8, the median bottom-up equity analyst forecast for S&P 500 earnings growth in 2007 has stopped falling and remains above 6 percent .  Third, buyout and buyback activity continues unabated.  Exhibit 9 shows the flow of funds data on net equity issuance.  As can be seen, the outstanding supply of U.S.  equities is shrinking rapidly, in contrast to the increase in net supply that occurred over the 2000-04 period.  Buyouts and buybacks may also be a factor explaining the recent behavior of corporate credit spreads.  As shown in exhibit 10, high- yield and emerging -market debt spreads have mostly recovered since the late February widening.  However, investment- grade debt spreads remain wider than in early 2007.  Investment- grade debt performance may be lagging because investors fear that the credit quality of this debt will be undermined as buyouts and buybacks result in increased leverage.    Turning now to the currency markets, an emerging story is the weakness of the U.S. dollar.  As shown in exhibit 11, the dollar has fallen about 3 percent  against the euro since th e start of the year and is virtually flat against the yen over this period.  The weakness against the euro appears to reflect mostly changing interest rate expectations.  Exhibit 12 plots the spread between the June 2008 Eurodollar contract and the euribor contract.  As can be seen in this exhibit, the expected interest rate differential has fallen about 40 basis points this year.  As this has occurred, the euro has strengthened.   To date, the dollar’s weakness has not been of much concern to market partici pants.  The decline has been gradual, and investors perceive that global imbalances are unwinding smoothly.  Nevertheless, the subprime debacle points to another source of risk for the dollar.  In recent years, the net acquisition of dollar-denominated financial assets by foreign investors has shifted to private flows from public flows and to corporate bonds, including asset- backed securities and CDO obligations, from Treasury and agency debt.  This shift is shown in exhibit 13.  My worry here is that the problems in the subprime and a lt-A mortgage market could May 9, 20074 of 130ultimately affect  foreign investors’ appetites for U.S. asset -backed securities and CDOs.  F or example, a particularly poor performance of  lower -rated ABS and CDO tranches , coupled with the widespread corporate rating downgrades that might be associated with such poor performance, could cause foreign investors to lose confidence in investing in dollar-denominated debt.     In terms of U.S.  interest rate expectations, investors expect no near -term change in policy.  However, market participants continue to expect significant easing late this year and in 2008.  Interest rate expectations for the remainder of 2007 are back where they were at the time of the January FOMC meeting.  Looking at the federal fun ds rate futures market in e xhibit 1 4, we can see that only about one 25 basis point rate cut is expected in 2007.  In contrast, expectations for 2008 more closely resemble expectations at the time of the December and March FOMC meetings, not the January  meeting .  As can be seen in e xhibit 1 5, which plots Eurodollar futures contract yields, investors expect substantial monetary policy easing in 2008.  Why this delayed pattern of easing?  There are three potential explanations.  First, as I have noted before,  futures market yields reflect the mean , not the modal, forecast.  To the extent that investors perceive a moderate risk of significant economic weakness that could lead to pronounced monetary policy easing, then the yields in the futures market could be well below the modal forecasts of investors.  Second, some investors may disagree with the FOMC about the outlook.  In this case, they might anticipate that it will take time for the FOMC to come around to their way of thinking —leading to rate cuts that occur only later.  Third, some investors may anticipate that inflation will moderate.  As this happens, the FOMC might gradually reduce its nominal federal funds rate target following lower inflation —essentially keeping the real federal funds rate constant.     Finally, the survey of the primary dealers shows little change in interest rate expectations since the last FOMC meeting.  Exhibits 16 and 17 compare dealer expectations with market expectations before  the March FOMC meeting and before  this meeting.  The  horizontal bold lines represent market expectations.  The blue circles represent the different dealer forecasts, and the size of a circle represents how many dealers have that forecast.  The green circles represent the average dealer forecast for each period.  The average of the primary dealer forecasts is consistent with only slightly more than 25 basis points of easing through the end of this year —not much different from  what is priced into the federal funds futures market.  As can be seen, the dispersion of the dealer forecasts over the next few quarters  has narrowed a bit.  However, considerable disagreement remains about whether short- term rates will be higher or lower a year ahead.  A lso, the average of the dealer forecasts for 2008 remains considerab ly above market expectations.  This presumably reflects mainly the “downside risks” notion, which should cause the modal forecasts of dealers to be higher than the mean expectations represented by futures prices.  I’ll be happy to take any questions.     May 9, 20075 of 130I will need approval for domestic operations; there were no foreign operations.  Also, I circulated a memo asking you to vote to approve renewal of the swap lines to Canada and Mexico.   CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  Questions?  President Fisher.   MR. FISHER.   I have two questions.  On page 2 , when you talk about subprime paper , do we have any data that can tell us anything about the stress in the alt -A markets specifically?  MR. DUDLEY.  There is definitely some spillover into alt -A, but alt -A delinquencies an d losses are a fraction of subprime.  If you compare the characteristics  of alt -A loans with th ose of subprime loans, you’ll see the same easing of underwriting standards in the alt -A market that occurred in the subprime market and almost identical charact eristic s of the underwriting standards except for one difference—the FICO score.   The FICO score for alt-A is much higher.  Apparently, the FICO score is pretty important because the losses for alt -A are a fraction of th ose on subprimes.  But there are dat a that show some spillover. MR. FISHER.  My  second question regard s S&P earnings.  Is there a way to  split out what comes from the rest of the world and what comes from the U nited States ?  I know it would be analytically difficult, but I’m just wondering i f there is a disparity between the two in what drops to the bottom line. MR. DUDLEY.  I’m sure there is a disparity between the two.  I do not know of any way to break that out clearly .  One factor —the weakness of the dollar versus the e uro—is definitely helping to boost corporate earnings.  A disproportionate share of U.S. foreign activity is Europe-oriented, so it’s a bigger share than would be suggest ed by the European share of global GDP.  That factor is definitely help ing to support our earnings.  I ha ve never seen any data on that.  We’ll look into it to see if there’s anything, but I’m not hopeful. MR. FISHER.  Thanks, Bill. May 9, 20076 of 130"
95,20070628,"also play ed a role, including mortgage convexity hedging and, perhaps, the gradual shift in the appetite of f oreign central banks away from U .S. Treasury securities toward other assets.        As shown in exhibit 4, monetary policy expectations as embodied in the Eurodollar futures market have shifted sharply since the last FOMC meeting.  In May, a drop of more t han 50 basis points in Eurodollar rates was anticipated to occur by the end of 2008.  In contrast, currently the Eurodollar futures strip is virtually flat—indicating that market expectations are close to neutral through 2008.  This shift in expectations i s also evident in responses to our survey of primary dealers.  Using exhibits 5 and 6, we can compare the dealers’ forecasts before the May 9 meeting with their forecasts before our meeting today.  The green circles represent the average forecast  of the de alers; the size of the blue circles indicates the frequency of different forecasts ; and the horizontal dark lines represent  market rates.  As can be seen in these exhibits, over the intermeeting period the dealer forecasts have moved upward, but much less than market expectations.  This presumably reflects the fact that the market rate represents the mean of potential outcomes whereas  the dealer forecasts are modal forecasts.  Also, the smaller shift evident in the dealer forecasts may reflect the fact that  dealer forecasts tend to lag changes in market expectations when expectations are changing rapidly.  As can be seen in these two exhibits, much of the dispersion evident in the forecasts toward lower rates has vanished since the May 9 FOMC meeting , and the skew to the downside has disappeared.  Dealers who had forecasted  a flat or higher federal funds rate path generally did not alter their forecasts.  In contrast, dealers who had earlier anticipated easing have eliminated or dramatically scaled back those expectations.  For example, the blue circles evident in exhibit 5 at rates of 3.5 percent  and 4.0 percent  are not present in exhibit 6.      The dealer forecasts support the notion that expectations are changing mainly because market participants are less  worried about downside risks to growth rather than because they think that the growth rate of real GDP will likely be stronger.  With the exception of the current quarter, in which GDP forecasts have been revised upward sharply following a very weak first quarter, the real GDP forecasts of dealers have generally not changed materially through 2008.  This is illustrated in e xhibit 7 .  Instead, as shown in exhibit 8, dealers are now, collectively, more certain about the growth outlook—in other words, the downside risks to growth have diminished.  The reduction in the downside risks to growth may also be important in explaining the modest rise in breakeven inflation measures.  If the downside risks to growth have diminished, then a corollary may be that the upside risks to inflation have increased.  In that case, investors should show more interest in purchasing inflation protection.  The breakeven inflation measure calculated from nominal Treasury and TIPS yields has several components, including expected inflation and the premium paid by investors for inflation protection.  In assessing the rise in these breakeven inflation measures due to diminished downside risks to growth, it is unclear how to apportion the rise in the overall breakeven inflation measures between a higher premium for inflation protection and  higher expected inflation.  In theory at least, reduced June 27-28, 20074 of 261downside risks to growth might reasonably be expected to push both components a bit higher.   Three other factors behind the backup in Treasury yields bear mentioning.  First, the shift in monetary policy expectations and the rise in longer-dated yields have been a global phenomenon.  When yields are rising elsewhere, that shift should put some upward pressure on U.S. long-term rates.  Second, mortgage- related convexity hedging may have exacerbated the speed and magnitude of the rise in yields.  A rise in yields causes expected rates  of prepayment on lower-coupon fixed- rate mortgages to fall, which lengthens the average duration of mortgage portfolios.  Mortgage servicers, the housing-related GSEs, and other mortgage holders respond by selling long-dated Treasury securities and long- dated interest rate swaps to reduce the average duration of their holdings.  Exhibit 9 shows that most conventional fixed- rate mortgages are below current mortgage rates.  As rates rise, these mortgages get further “out of  the money.”  This lowers expected prepayment rates  and lengthens duration, and people react by hedging.  As long- term rates keep rising, the effect  of higher interest rates on duration gradually lessens as the rates on most outstanding mortgages fall further below current market rates.  The effect  of mortgage convexity hedging is evident in the relative underperformance of ten -year Treasuries, which is one of the preferred hedging vehicles versus mortgages, relative to other Treasury maturities.  The week ending on June 13 had the biggest rise in longer- term Treasury yields.  As shown in exhibit 10, this was also the week in which ten -year Treasury yields ro se the most compared with  five-year and thirty -year Treasury rates.  To the extent that mortgage convexity hedging pushes up nominal ten -year Treasury yields more than other yields, then it may also temporarily distort breakeven inflation measures.  Third, diminished appetite among central banks for Treasury securities may have also been a factor behind the rise in longer-dated yields.  Central bank buying was often a featured part of the story when bond term premiums were unusually narrow.  F oreign central  banks may have played a role in the recent rise in bond term premiums.  As shown in exhibit 11, the growth rate of Treasury custody holdings at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York has slowed sharply since April.  But it is important not to push this point too strongly.  Although foreign central banks with the largest foreign exchange reserve holdings are diversifying their portfolios away from Treasuries, they still appear to be extending the average maturity of those Treasuries that they hold, which implies a continued bid for longer- dated Treasuries from this source.         Turning now to other market developments, the most striking aspect of this period of rising Treasury yields has been the limited effect  that this rise has had on the risk appetite of  investors in most other markets.  This is in sharp contrast to the reduction in risk appetites that occurred in a broad array of asset classes in late February and the first half of March.  For example, as shown in exhibit 12, the rise in long- term yields  has not caused the U.S. equity market to retrench.  As shown in exhibit 13, until the past week or so, corporate debt spreads have been relatively stable.  A lso, in the foreign exchange markets, the carry trade remains alive and well.  One way to see this  is in exhibit 14 , which illustrates the change in the value of the yen against  high-June 27-28, 20075 of 261yielding currencies such as the Australian dollar and New Zealand dollar as well as against the U .S. dollar and the euro.  As can be seen, in the late February selloff, the yen rallied , and the high-yielding currencies sold off sharply.  In contrast, during the recent rise in interest rates, the yen weakened and the high -yielding currencies appreciated.  Similarly, as illustrated in exhibit 15, although volatility in the U.S. Treasury market moved up sharply (shown by the rise in the MOVE index), volatility in the equity and foreign exchange markets remained quite low.    In the foreign exchange markets, movements between  the major c urrencies  continue to be driven mainly by changes in expected interest rate differentials.  Exhibit 16 shows the movement in the spreads between the September 2008 Eurodollar futures yield versus Euribor futures for Europe and Euroyen futures for Japan.  As can be seen here, interest rate expectat ions shifted more sharply upward in the U nited States  relative to Japan than relative to Europe.  Not surprisingly, as shown in exhibit 17, the dollar appreciated more sharply against the yen than against the euro over this period.  The yen’s weakness, which has been persistent but stealthy, may begin to receive more attention.  After all, as shown in exhibit 18, while the nominal yen/dollar exchange rate has fluctuated in a relatively narrow range in recent years, the real effective yen exchange rate has d eclined sharply over this period—a rate of decline that may be intensifying.  For example, in May the real effective exchange rate of the yen —as estimated by the BIS —had fallen to its lowest point since the early 1980s and had declined nearly to  half of its early 1995 peak .  Although the June BIS data are not yet available, the rate of depreciation has likely increased over the past month.  Although calm generally pervades U.S. financial markets, there is one important exception worthy of note.  The subprim e mortgage space is still very unsettled —hurt both by poor housing market fundamentals and by the problems of two hedge funds sponsored by Bear Stearns.  Exhibit 19 shows the behavior of the spread on the ABX 06-2 index, which is an index based on a basket of credit default swaps on underlying cash securities.  As can be seen, the spread has increased to a new high , and underlying CDS spreads have also increased.  There is a danger that forced liquidation of illiquid subprime -based securities could exacerbate the pressure on this market.  However, it should be noted that the Bear Stearns-sponsored hedge funds that are in trouble are not particular large; the problems of these hedge funds appear to be mostly exceptional rather than the norm; and the counterparty exposures generated by these hedge funds are broadly distributed and have already shrunk sharply in size.  That said, there still are risks that forced selling could drive market prices down sharply, leading to lower marks for other portfolios of asset s related to subprime mortgages.  This, in turn, could lead to margin calls, investor redemptions, and further selling pressure in this market.     In terms of lessons learned, three points come to mind.  First, high credit ratings don’t fully capture measures of risk.  The ratings are based on the risk of default, not the market risks associated with illiquidity.  As a result, highly  leveraged portfolios of highly rated but illiquid assets are subject to significant market risk that the ratings June 27-28, 20076 of 261"
96,20070807,"CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Today is also Vincent Reinhart’s final FOMC meeting.  Vince went to work at the New York Fed in 1983 and came to the Board— PARTICIPANT.   Is he here?  MS. SMITH .  He’s coming. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  He’s coming.  Well, he gets docked for...  [Laughter]  MR. KOHN.  Make sure he submits a leave card.  [Laughter]    CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, let me make a couple of other announcements, and then we’ll move on.  First of all, in the days when Don Winn was the head of the Congressional Liaison Office, it was customary for him to present during the luncheon after the meeting an update on congressional matters.  Laricke Blanchard, whom I think most of you know, is now the head of the Congressional Liaison Office.  We would like to begin that tradition again.  We have lunch, of course, for President Moskow, but if there are a few minutes after the adjournment, Laricke will provide us with a short update.  He has already circulated a written summary.  So if we don’t get to the update , at least we will have th e summary .  In the future we are going to try to have a congressional update at every meeting.   Second, on communications, the subcommittee sent a memo to the Committee on July 25.  Broadly speaking, the recommendations were that we should now focus on expanding the FOMC projections as our next step in increasing transparency, that  we submit trial-run projections in September as we did for August and  live projection s, so to speak, for the October meeting, and that we vote in October to approve this step.  M y sense from June was that there was a general agreement on this approach.  We would like to give you several more opportunities to comment and to discuss details.  We will poll you between now and the September meeting on remaining issues.  In September, there will be an agenda item for final August 7, 20074 of 136discussion of various issues that might come up.  In October, we will have another opportunity to talk about it.  I would like, if possible, to take a vote at the October meeting, which would be followed by a roll -out about three weeks later, with a press release and  with  a speech by me, and then by  the information in the minutes that would come out.  So that is where we are.  Again, we will have an opportunity to talk about the program on an agenda item in September. The subcommittee also recommended, based on the discussion we had earlier, that we vote on the entire statement.  I would like to make that also an agenda item in September.  I have asked Scott Alvarez, our General Counsel, working with Monetary Affairs, to provide us with a memo that  will address two issues.  First, what is the legal status?  What specific action do we have to take to allow the Committee to vote on the full statement?  Secon d, it would be worthwhile to have them take one more look to see whether there are any unintended consequences.  For example, would this inhibit us in any way if there were intermeeting moves or any special steps being taken?  But the plan would be to have a brief discussion in September on this memo, to take a vote, and, if we agree, the full statement would be subject to a Committee vote.  Today, let’s stay with the old process, which still allows a vote on the balance-of-risk assessment.  Let me raise an item of business here.  Since Vince Reinhart clearly has disappeared, we need to vote for a replacement.  We need to nominate and elect a new secretary and economist to the FOMC whose position would be valid until the first regularly scheduled meeting of 2008.  Would you like to make a nomination? MR. KOHN.  I nominate Brian Madigan, with pleasure. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Other nominations?  [Laughter]  If not, all in favor say “aye.”  Opposed?  Carried unanimously.  Congratulations, Brian. August 7, 20075 of 136MR. MADIGAN.  Thank you very much. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  I will wait until Vince appears.  He may be looking at financial markets this morning, and so we will wait until he appears to bid him farewell.  Let’s go ahead,  then , to the authorization for Desk operations and t urn it over to Bill Dudley.  Bill? MR. DUDLEY.1  Thank you.  As you all know, there has been considerable financial market turbulence since the last meeting:  Problems in subprime mortgage credit have persisted and intensified; credit -rating  agencies have begun to downgrade asset -backed securities and CDOs (collateralized debt obligations) that reference subprime debt; the problems in subprime have spread into the a lt-A mortgage space and into parts of the prime mortgage market; corporate credit has been infected, with high-yield bond and loan spreads moving out sharply; and stock prices have faltered.  Although markets generally have been functioning well in terms of liquidity and the ability to transact, there have been some important exceptions.  The nonconforming residential mortgage market and the structured -finance product markets —especially the CDO and CLO (collateralized loan obligation) markets —have been significantly impaired , and there are concerns about the ability of some asset -backed commercial paper programs to continue to source funding via that market.  As a consequence, market expectations with respect to monetary policy have shifted sharply, with market expectations consistent with considerable monetary policy easing over the next year.  Mar ket participants are worried about the effect  of tightening credit standards on housing and about the deterioration in the market function in structured finance, which could broaden and be self- reinforcing, ultimately damaging the macroeconomy.    I am goi ng to be referring to this handout as we go through these comments.  In tracing the  source of the turmoil that we have experienced recently, we find that the deterioration of the subprime mortgage sector continues to play an important role in several ways.   First, the deterioration in underlying credit quality continues unabated.  As shown in exhibit 1, delinquencies of more than sixty days for recent ABX index vintages have continued to move higher, and the pace of deterioration—measured by the steepness of the curves —has, if anything, worsened.  Note that the newest vintage—07-2, so the second half of 2007—does not show any benefit from improved underwriting standards.  That stems mainly from the fact that the pipeline to build these securities is relative ly long— with the average loan referenced by  this index more than six months old at this point .  It also may reflect the fact that this newest vintage gets —in contrast to earlier vintages —less benefit from earlier home -price appreciation.   As a consequence of this poor credit performance, ABX spreads have continued to widen sharply.  This is shown in exhibit 2, which shows the performance for ABX BBB - tranches across vintages, and exhibit 3, which shows the performance for the various tranches of the 07- 1 vintage.  T he deterioration in the                                                  1 Materials used by Mr. Dudley are appended to this transcript (appendix 1).  August 7, 20076 of 136"
97,20070810,"rolled over is coming due.  But I would say that, at this point , the U.S. commercial paper market is still functioning,  and that’s where we are right now.   CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Brian, would you like to add anything?  MR. MADIGAN.  No, that was complete, Mr. Chairman.  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Are there any questions for Brian or Bill?  President Lacker.  MR. LACKER.  Bill, I have a couple of things.  There are asset -backed commercial paper program s that are backed by mortgage- backed securities.  How much of those are showing up in our mortgage -backed tranch es in recent RPs, in recent interventions like yesterday ’s?  I guess you don’ t find out until later in the day how much of that shows up in today’s intervention.  Another question I have would be how late in the day you feel that  you can do another RP operation.  MR. DUDLEY.  What was the second question, Jeff?  MR. LACKER.  The other one is, How late in the day do you think you can do an RP operation?   Then a third question I have has to do with the RP market in general.  I ’ve heard about asset -backed paper going into RP programs instead of outrights, and I’m wondering whether  that’s  affecting trading in the RP market and whether there are RP spreads for different collateral .  What are you hearing about that ? MR. DUDLEY.  As far as what we g et in terms of propositions  today, we’re assuming that it will be mostly mortgage -related RP s since we did a single tranche  and did not distinguish among  different types of collateral .  But I don’t have the answer to that question in terms of what the composition of today’s $ 19 billion RP was ; we are presuming that it will be mostly mortgage related .  As far as how late in the day, we can go fairly late.  Obviously the effectiveness  diminishes considerably if we go later in the day, and I think it is more symbolic.   Our feeling is that the $ 19 billion we added  today should be more than enough, and so we would expect the fed funds rate to come off.  The reason the D esk statement said  that we would come back if necessary  was that  we August 10, 20074 of 12wanted to reassure people that this wasn’t their only chance to get reserves if things were to deteriorate as we go throug h the day.  So I think we’ll take a look at where things are  at midmorning .  If the fed funds rate is still trading firm to the 5¼ target, I think we would come in fairly early —midmorning. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Other questions.  President Hoenig.  MR. HOENIG.   Yes.  I don’t know if Tim , Bill, or maybe Brian can answer this, but I’m interested in whether we’re seeing or having conversations with any of the banks in terms of lines of credit being pulled or any kinds of pressures they might be se nsing  that would have implications for the discount window as side effects.  MR. DUDLEY.  This is Bill Dudley.   I’m not aware of any news on that front.  I think Washington Mutual will be the one on which you would be most focused, given what they said overnight in terms of  their filing.  Obviously, they  are focused on mortgage -related product s, so I think they would probably  be having the most difficulty today.  I’m not aware of any other places with problems.  VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  T om, t his is Tim.   We have no indication that  the major, more diversified institutions  are facing any funding pressure.  In fact, some of them report what we classically see in a context like this, which is that money is flowing to them.  That, of course, could change quickly.  B ut apart from t hose that are more narrowly in the mortgage market that can’t basically sell any non -agency product s, I don’t think we’re seeing any sense of funding pressure.  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Governor Mishkin.  MR. MISHKIN.  Yes, I’d just like to understand a bit more about what’s going on in terms of Europe.  My understanding is that  yesterday , when the European Central Bank injected all  that August 10, 20075 of 12liquidity , a lot of it was done through borrowing from their standing facility.  Do we have an idea of what exactly the banks ar e using those funds for?  MR. DUDLEY.  Our understanding, Governor Mishkin, is that they’re using them essentially to fund some of the commercial paper  in Europe that’s running off.  Also, I think some of the funds are  just ext ra liquidity , precautionary balances  for reserves.   We received  a comment overnight that suggested that there was a potentially fairly significant misallocation of reserves within Europe as people were hoa rding their liquidity.  So some of the funds are  probably being used to replace commercial paper, but some of them are  probably just being held as precautionary balances.  MR. MISHKIN.  So is it spending directly?  Are the  banks  buying commercial paper, or are they lending directly to the people who can’t roll over their commercial pape r? MR. DUDLEY.  I don’t know the answer to that.  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Poole.  MR. POOLE.  Is there a downside  to providing funds more generously than we are now, deliberately pushing the fed funds rate decidedly below 5¼ just to try to smooth every thing over here?  MR. DUDLEY.  Well, if we are successful, we should expect that the fed funds rate could soften significantly, but there’s no way that we can stabilize it at 5¼, if that’s your question.  One consequence of being aggressive and adding reser ves is that , if we’re successful , late in the day the funds rate could be trading  at 1 or 2 percent.  That’s a possibility. MR. POOLE.  Let me restate the question .  If it appears this morning after trading for an hour or two that we’re still not decisively below 5¼, it would seem to me that we ought to consider August 10, 20076 of 12"
98,20070816,"rate over the next month of less than 5 percent.  This is consistent with a significant rise in risk premiums .  Second, over the past two days, we have seen a sharp decline in Treasury bill rates.  Although a diminished supply may be a partial explanation, flight -to-quality concerns appear to account for most of the sharp move down in yields.  Some investors have reported that dealers are very reluctant to sell Treasury bills.   Third, ot her measures show that risk aversion has increased.  F or example, interest rate swap spreads have widened significantly, and the spread between on- the-run and off -the-run Treasuries has increased.   Fourth, equity prices around the world have moved lower.  The S&P 500 index is now down roughly 10 percent from its peak.   Fifth, the so -called carry trade in currencies i s unwinding with a vengeance.  The yen has appreciated sharply  against the dollar, even as the dollar has strengthened against many other curre ncies, such as the euro.  The yen- dollar rate has fallen below 114.   Sixth, market volatility has spiked.  The V IX measure of implied volatility for the stock market has climbed above 30, well above the peak it reached in late February and early March.  Implied volatility in fixed income in currency markets has also moved up sharply.   The market turbulence and the rise in risk aversion have created several areas of vulnerability.  First, there is the risk that money market mutual funds could suffer losses on certain asset -backed commercial paper programs that have weak backstops.  This could conceivably cause some funds to “ break the b uck.”   In the worst case, this could even result in a run from these funds by investors.  Second, worries about the exposure of the financial guarantors to the mortgage market could cause problems to  spread from this area to areas that have up to now been more sheltered from stress, such as the municipal securities market.   The intense market turbulence has caused investors to become more worried about the downside risk to the economy.  As a result, investors now anticipate significant monetary policy easing in the weeks and months ahead, much more than even a week ago.  For example, September federal funds futures currently imply a 4.92 percent federal funds rate for the month, 33 basis points below the current 5¼ percent target , and the  Eurodollar future s strip through mid- 2008 is consistent with roughly 100 basis points of easing over this period.  Thank you.  I’m happy to take  any questions.   CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Are there questions for Bill?  President Lacker.  MR. LACKER.   Bill, do we still sterilize discount window loans?  MR. DUDLEY.   Yes, discount window loans will be an increase of reserves into the banking system.  We would have to be making offsetting adjustments either  to our portfolio or  to our rep urchase interventions.  Absolutely.  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Hoenig, I believe.  August 16, 20074 of 37MR. HOENIG.  Yes.  I just have a question for Bill.   Can you elaborate on your comment about  the effects and the perceptions of weak backstops on some of the issuers?  I didn’t quite catch it, and I’d like to know a little more , if you don’t mind.  MR. DUDLEY.   Oh, sure.  The asset -backed commercial paper programs have a wide variety of backstops to protect holders of commercial paper.  Some have bank lines .  Some have credit co -return swaps that basically are equivalent to  bank line s.  So if the programs are terminated and the collateral has to be liquidated, the banks are on the hook for the diff erence between the collateral and the par value.   A third kind of backstop, though , has turned out to be quit e weak, and that’s what  is called the credit enhancement backstop.  That’s when you might have a commercial paper program that’s basically funding AAA- rated assets, and the backstop is just a little overcollateralization of those AAA assets.   The problem is that , in some cases , the degree of overcollateralization is too small relative to where those AAA assets currently trade.  For example, in one as set-backed commercial paper program, the credit enhancement was 2 percent of the AAA assets .  I talked with  the person who runs that entity, who  said that a lot of their AAA assets , if they had to be liquidated today , would sell in the range of 88 to 92 cents on the dollar.  So if they were liquidated, the commercial paper holders would actually have losses.  MR. HOENIG.  So when you were talking about the third backstop as weakened, the lines of credit are still there, and the banks aren’t able to back away  from those at this point or are not backing away?  MR. DUDLEY.   Well, they look to be pretty solid.  We don’t seem to have the problem that cropped up in Canada where , my understanding is , commercial paper programs that were put in place or backstops that were put in place before  January 1 of this year  had a market disruption clause:   The backstop was operative only if the circumstance was deemed a market disruption, August 16, 20075 of 37which gave the provider of the backstop the argument, well, this wasn’t a market disruption —it was an event specific  to this particular issuer.   Now, the Canadians, through some moral suasion, managed to clear th at up, but we don’t have that particular issue.  MR. HOENIG.  Bill, are you hearing any discussion of kicking in the “material adverse” clauses ?  Are  those are being talked about or thought  about, do you know?   MR. DUDLEY.   I haven’t heard any discussion about that.  MR. HOENIG.  Okay.  Thank you. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Fisher.  MR. FISHER.  Bill, is there any evidence of a credit cru nch in households?  Are we seeing or are you hearing about any lagging of receivables on credit card payables or any other evidence that households with good credit are having trouble?  MR. DUDLEY.   I think there has been some evidence of a modest uptick in  credit cards and auto loans, but I don’t think you can characterize it as severe.  I also would say it is in the  early days.  The really  intense part of this market disruption has happened pretty recently.  I would be surprised if you found anything showi ng up in real time.   From an economic perspective, if I can put on my old economist hat for just a moment, I would say that the market disruption in terms of its macro consequences presumably will be felt mostly through the provision of mortgage credit   in the nonconforming mortgage loan area —large mortgage loans , subprime mortgage loans , or alt-A mortgage loans .  The  sum of all those  was a fairly significant portion o f the mortgage market last year.   Obviously, the depository institutions can take up some of th e slack, but I think it’s probably pretty reasonable to think that mortgage credit availability and mortgage credit underwriting standards are going to be quite different this year than they were in 2006.  MR. FISHER.  Thank you.  Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. August 16, 20076 of 37"
99,20070918,"contract ion of the asset- backed commercial paper (ABCP)  market ; the virtual shutdown of the collateralized debt obligation (CDO) and collateralized loan obligation (CLO) markets; the sharp shifts we saw  into and out of Treasury-only versus prime money market mutual funds, which in turn disrupted the Treasury bill market;  and the anticipated pressure on bank balance sheets and the upward pressure on term funding rates.    The pressure on bank balance sheets is coming from three major sources.  First, investor demand for securitized non-agency mortgage-backed securities has dried up.  Bank originators now have to hold such loans in their bank portfolios.  Second, bank backstop liquidity facilities have been triggered as investor appetite for asset- backed commercial paper has fallen sharply.   Third, banks are expected to have difficulty syndicating the bridge loans that they provided to finance leveraged buyouts.   Of these three sources of pressure, the rollup of ABCP programs has been, in my view, the most important.  The magnitude of the potential funding requirement is the largest , and how much will come back onto bank balance sheets is very uncertain.  The constraint on mortgage loan origination can be seen most visibly in the widening of the spread between fixed -rate prime jumbo mortgage loan rates  and conforming mortgage loan rates.  As you can see in exhibit 1, the spread has widened from around 25 basis points to around 100 basis points in recent weeks.  The sharp contraction in the ABCP  market began when commerc ial paper investors became aware that their investments could be vulnerable to loss but were uncertain as to the extent of their exposure in particular programs.  This fear of loss had a legitimate basis for those ABCP programs that finance mortgage- related assets without full bank credit enhancement.  An inability to roll over these programs in the current market would force the liquidation of the assets.  In the current market, that could lead to investor losses.  The problem started in extenda ble commercial paper market programs, where the credit enhancement backstop by banks was typically either absent or less than 100 percent .  The problem then quickly migrated to s tructured -investment vehicle (SIV) programs, which suffered from similar shortcomings.  From there, the problem spread as risk -averse investors started to shun the entire asset class.  Asset -backed commercial paper rates rose for those programs that were able to roll over their outstanding commercial paper.  This is shown in exhibit 2, which c ompares unsecured and secured commercial paper rates.  The volume of outstanding asset-backed commercial paper shrank sharply as some issuers were unable to roll over their maturing paper.  Exhibit 3 illustrates the downtrend in the volume of outstanding ABCP.  Exhibit 4 shows the maturity structure of outstanding asset- backed commercial paper and highlights the high proportion of paper that is now being rolled on an overnight basis.  The pressure on the asset- backed commercial paper market was temporarily exacerbated by the behavior of money market mutual fund investors, who shifted funds last month from prime money market funds to Treasury-only money market funds (see exhibit 5).  Because the total assets in money market mutual funds are nearly four times the size of outstanding Treasury bills, these flows led to a large, albeit mostly transitory fall in Treasury bill yields.  Th at is shown in exhibit 6.    September 18, 20074 of 188The good news is that the money flows into the prime money mutual funds have stabilized.  This reflec ts greater discernment among investors about the risks associated with different types of asset -backed commercial paper and the widening yield differentials between prime and Treasury -only money market funds.  It is noteworthy that those areas of the asset -backed commercial paper market with underlying structural problems—primarily the extendable, SIV, and SIV- lite portions of the market —represent only a small proportion of total asset- backed commercial paper outstanding.  For example, as shown in exhibit 7, SIV programs represented  only about 7 percent of the asset -backed commercial paper market before the recent sharp contraction.  Moreover, as shown in exhibit 8, much of the asset- backed commercial paper market does not finance residential mortgage asset -backed securities, so there is less uncertainty about the underlying value of the assets.  A lso, much of the market has solid credit support, with 100 percent  bank  credit enhancement.  This suggests that, as time passes, investors will gradually be able to  distinguish between the different types of the ABCP programs and stability will return to the multi- seller, bank -sponsored programs.  Already, the pace of contraction of the overall ABCP market has slowed significantly.  However, the extendable and SIV pr ograms are likely to continue to be under pressure.    The third source of balance sheet pressure stems from the sharp contraction in CDO and CLO issuance.  As can be seen in exhibit 9, CDO and CLO issuance volumes have plummeted in recent months.  The vir tual closure of the CDO market  has led , in turn, to a virtual cessation of high- yield debt issuance—illustrated in exhibit 10.  These developments have created uncertainty for commercial and investment banks about their ability to syndicate the large volume of loan and debt commitments that they have made to finance private equity buyouts.  These institutions are faced with the prospect that they may have to carry such loans on their books for an extended period at a discount to  par value.  Syndication will be more difficult because the ability to transform a large proportion of these obligations into marketable investment -grade products through the alchemy of structured finance is not currently an available option.  This pressure on bank balance sheets—both existing and anticipated —has led to significant dysfunction in financial markets.  In particular, primary dealers have pulled back in their willingness to finance the security positions of investment banks, hedge funds, and other leveraged investors.  Exhibit 11 illustrates the median repurchase- rate bid -asked  spread by primary dealers for thre e types of collateral —GSE MBS, p rime MBS, and high -yield corporate debt —at overnight, one-week, and one-month maturities.  As can be seen, there has been an upward trend in bid- asked  spreads, especially at the one- month maturity.   Exhibit 12 illustrates the median haircuts applied against such collateral.  Again, there has been an increase, which has been particularly pronounced at the one-month maturity.    At the s ame time, this balance sheet pressure and worries about counterparty risk have led to a significant rise in term borrowing rates.  Banks that are sellers of funds have shifted to the overnight market to preserve their liquidity, and this shift has September 18, 20075 of 188starved the term market of funds, pushing those rates higher.  As shown in exhibit 13, the spread between the one -month LIBOR  and the one-month interest rate swap rate has widened sharply, and the one-month LIBOR  has generally traded considerably above the anticip ated level of the overnight federal funds rate.  The same pressure on funding rates has been also evident in euribor rates (see exhibit 14).  The rise in term rates has pushed  banks that depend on funding from the interbank market into the overnight market.  In addition, these depository institutions have turned to the Federal Home Loan  Bank  system as a source of term funding.  For example, FHLB advances rose $110 billion in August.  In contrast, despite the 50 basis point reduction in the spread between th e discount rate and the federal funds rate target, the dollar value of discount window borrowings remains modest, as shown in exhibit 15.  This reflects the lower cost of FHLB advances, the ability to borrow at longer terms from the FHLB, and the lack of s tigma in using such  advances as a source of funding.    So where do we go from here?  Clearly, the adjustment process is far from over.  Asset -backed commercial paper programs are still being rolled up , and there is considerable uncertainty about how diffi cult it will be to roll some of this paper over quarter -end.  Moreover, it remains unclear what proportion of leveraged loan commitments commercial and investment banks will be able to syndicate and at what price.  Despite the big backlog and the end of the August doldrums, there has, as yet, been little syndication activity.  The good news, of course, is that as time passes, the uncertainty about bank balance sheet pressures and funding requirements should lessen.  Moreover, investors’ ability to distinguish between “good” and “bad” ABCP programs and structured -finance products should continue to improve.  The bad news is that the stress caused by the forcible deleveragin g of the nonbank financial sector could lead to further losses accompanied by headlines that could further damage investor confidence.  Moreover, the increased reliance by banks on overnight funding increases rollover risk and may limit the willingness of banks to expand their balance sheets to accommodate the deleveraging of the non bank financial sector.   In the mortgage sector, depository institutions will undoubtedly—at the right price —take up the slack in the prime jumbo mortgage market.  But nondepository institutions are unlikely to be able to originate and securitize nonconforming mort gages in appreciable volume for some time.   The tone in financial markets has improved a bit in recent days.  Nevertheless, we still appear to be in an environment in which the dominant theme is risk aversion. This can be seen in a matrix that measures the correlation among the price movements in the major asset classes  (see exhibit 16) .  In times when markets are calm and untroubled, the correlation coefficients a re generally low.  As you can see in the e xhibit, which examines these correlations since the August 7 FOMC meeting, the correlation coefficients have been very high recently.    In the foreign exchange markets, two developments are worth noting.  First, the turmoil in money markets did impair the functioning of the foreign exchange swap market.  This made it more difficult for banks in Europe that are structurally short of dollars to obtain the dollar funding needed to fund their assets.  In recent days, this September 18, 20076 of 188"

This meeting is Karen Johnson’s last.  She attended her first meeting in 1991 and has been a regular participant for the past ten  years, so she has ninety-one total FOMC meetings to her credit.   Karen has been  briefing the FOMC on international financial and economic matters since she became head of the International Finance Division in 1997, and she has done a great job of covering about 95 percent of the world’s population and about two-thirds or more of the world’s economic activity.  Also, as the head of IF, she has logged an awful lot of miles to World Bank– IMF meetings, the BIS, and elsewhere.  She has given me a lot of good advice on jetlag, I can assure you.  She is going to finance her retirement with f requent -flyer miles.  [Laughter]   So, Karen, I am sure every member of the Committee would like to join me in thanking you for your dedication and your excellent advice and counsel.  Best of luck.  [Applause]  MS. JOHNSON.  Thank you. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I have the less pleasant dut y of reminding everybody about the Wall Street Journal  article on our communications policy that appeared some time ago.  I don’t think anybody actually leaked the story, because the way Greg Ip works is that he goes around and talks to each person and gets a little of the story and then builds it up in that way.  Nevertheless, I think it is obviously bad for our institution when our internal deliberations become public, and so let me just ask everyone, please, to be especially car eful about maintaining confidentiality.  Thank you. October 30-31, 20074 of 162For o ur first item today, in light of Karen’s retirement, we would like to propose Nathan Sheets to be an economist for the FOMC until the first meeting of 2008.  Do I have a motion? SEVERAL.  So moved. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Without objection.  Thank you.  Next, we turn to Bill Dudley. MR. DUDLEY.1  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I am going to miss Karen as my fellow scribe at the BIS .  She also was the person who identified who was actually speaking.  [Laughter]   Two crosscurrents have dominated financial markets since the September 18 FOMC meeting:  (1) greater discrimination by investors with respect to credit quality across asset classes versus (2) ongoing deterioration in credit quality within the class of mortgage- related assets .  On the one hand, underlying market function has generally improved.  In particular, investors have shown greater ability to differentiate between the corporate and the mortgage sectors and between different types of products such a s collateralized loan obligations (CLOs) versus collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) .  Most of the asset -backed commercial paper market is no longer under duress, bank funding pressures have abated somewhat, and the issuance of CLOs  and high-yield debt has increased .  On the other hand, those areas more closely linked to the U.S. housing sector remain under pressure.  This includes the subprime mortgage market, the mortgage- backed securities market, and financial entities —such as mortgage and financial guarantors —that have significant exposures to these asset classes.    The tension between the improved ability of investors to discriminate among risky assets versus the deteriorating fundamentals is illustrated in the performance of the ABX indexes .  These indexes  measure the cost of buying protection on different tranches of particular vintages of mortgage-backed securities that hold subprime mortgage loan assets .  I will be referring to the handout in front of you.  Exhibit 1 shows the performance for the 07-01 vintage—that is,  mortgage- backed securities originated mainly during the second half of 2006.  As can be seen, the prices of the lower -rated tranches have continued to plunge in response to rising delinquency rates for subprime loans and the virtual shutdown of the subprime mortgage market.  In contrast, the performance of the AAA- rated tranche has held up better, especially until very recently.  This suggests that investors are more carefully distinguishing between the implications of widespread subprime losses for those tranches, such as AAA, that are in a senior position in the structure versus lower- rated tranches, where the losses may well be large enough to wipe out their value altogether.  Similarly, investors appear to be doing a better job of discriminating between the different types of asset -backed commercial paper programs.  Those with high-quality, diversified                                                  1 Materials used by Mr. Dudley are appended to this transcript (appendix 1).  October 30-31, 20075 of 162collateral or strong bank support or both are performing well.  In contrast, those programs with less solid support—mainly SIV and extendible programs—in which the commercial paper holders are more vulnerable to loss continue to hit liquidity and capital triggers and are gradually being wound down.  As shown in exhibit 2, the overall asset -backed commercial paper market has been contracting recently at a much slower pace than earlier in the summer .  Moreover, secured commercial paper rates have narrowed significantly relative to the overnight index swap rate and relative to top -quality unsecured commercial paper ( exhibit 3).    The abil ity of banks to securitize assets also appears to have improved.  In particular, as shown in exhibits 4 and 5, CLO and high- yield debt issuance has picked up.  However, CDO issuance remains very depressed relative to the level of issuance earlier in the ye ar.  Investors have lost confidence in this product as market prices have plunged and the rating agencies have begun to cut their ratings, often very sharply, on many outstanding CDOs.  Market participants are more willing to buy corporate debt for three reasons.  First, the underlying fundamentals in the corporate sector remain good.  Second, the underlying assets are much easier to value.  Third, investors are more willing to trust the credit ratings in this area.  The rating agency models have been battl e-tested over a much longer period and have been shown to be robust across a broad range of environments.  In contrast, the ability of banks to securitize nonconforming mortgage loans remains impaired.  Nevertheless, spreads between jumbo and conforming mortgage loan  rates  have come in a bit (see e xhibit 6).  This may reflect diminished pressure on bank balance sheets from other sources.    Overall, term funding pressures for banks have diminished as banks have gained greater clarity about their future funding needs and the need for excess liquidity has diminished.  Nevertheless, term funding pressures still persist.  As can be seen in exhibit 7, although the spreads between one-month LIBOR  and the one-month overnight index swap rate and three -month LIBOR  and the three-month overnight index swap rate have narrowed, these spreads remain high relative to the level of spreads evident at the beginning of the summer.  Exhibit 8 shows the same spreads for Europe—they have also come in but remain higher than normal.  Although the credit default swap (CDS) spreads for the large investment banks and the large commercial banks narrowed following the last FOMC meeting, much of this improvement has been reversed over the past two weeks as the housing outlook has deteriorated further and as the earnings announcements for several major financial institutions have disappointed investors.  Similarly, the CDS spreads for mortgage insurers and financial guarantors have widened.  These CDS spreads are shown in exhibit 9 .    The b roader bond and equity markets have generally shown improvement.  In the fixed  income market, credit default swap spreads have fallen somewhat for the high-yield debt market (see exhibit 10), and the U.S. equity market has largely recovered  over the past couple of months (see exhibit 11).  Interestingly, despite the poor earnings of the financial sector and the outlook for slower U.S. growth, earnings expectations of equity analysts for 2007 have declined only slightly, and the decline October 30-31, 20076 of 162"
101,20071206,"those in the United States and the United Kingdom.  This may reflect, in part, the term funding operations of the European Central Bank.  The ECB monetary policy framework permits the ECB to provide a large amount of term funds to many different depository institutions that are secured by a broad range of collateral.  In addition, little stigma appears to be associated with the use of the ECB’s standing facility, in contrast to the United Kingdom and the United States, where stigma plays a much more important role in limiting borrowing from such facilities.    The upward pressure in term funding markets and the uncertainty about forward LIBOR  rates have  caused impairment of the foreign exchange swap market—a market used by many European banks to obtain dollar funding.  In this market, bid-asked spreads have widened, transaction sizes have dropped, and some dealers have stopped making markets.  As noted earlier, some of the upward pressure on term funding markets represents balance sheet adjustments for the year-end.  Currently, the cost of the two- day year -end turn is about 11 percent.  As shown in exhibit 4, the year-end premium has moved irregularly higher over the past six weeks to more than 600 basis points.  As can be seen in exhibit 5, this is much greater than what typically has occurred in other years.  However, it is much less than what was evident in 1999, when Y2K put significant upward pressure on implied forward rates over the year-end turn.    Although term funding pressures have been partly influenced by the year-end, it is important to recognize that these pressures are expected to persist as we mo ve into next year.  Exhibit 6 illustrates the spread implied by market expectations going forward.  As can be seen, although the spread is expected to drop about 40 basis points in January, the expected spread remains wider than in November and much wider than the very narrow margin that was evident before the August market turmoil.  Some have wondered whether one-month and three-month LIBOR  rates exaggerate the degree of funding pressures.  After all, LIBOR  rates are “offered” rates, and they represent the cost of funds at 11:00 a.m. in London.  Perhaps they do not reflect the true marginal costs of funding for banks that are perceived to be healthy.  There is something to this argument.  The spread between one-month LIBOR  relative to one-month OIS  rates is  high relative to the spreads on other sources of bank funding, such as certificate of deposits, term federal funds, and AA -rated commercial paper.  These other spreads are shown in exhibit 7.  But these other spreads are also considerably higher than normal and have been moving up recently.  This demonstrates that term funding pressures cannot just be dismissed as being narrowly based on the dollar needs of European banks.  Moreover, upward pressure on term rates is evident more broadly.  For example, as shown in exhibit 8, thirty- day asset -backed commercial paper rates and the spread to OIS rates have been moving up recently and are also very elevated.   So what is driving the upward pressure that is evident in term funding markets?  As I see it, there are three factors:  (1) the year -end, (2) balance sheet pressures , and (3) worries about counterparty risk.  I have already discussed the year- end effect.  I think it is very difficult to differentiate between balance sheet concerns and December 6, 20074 of 51counterparty risk.  Ba lance sheet concerns might be characterized as , Do I want to lend at term?  Counterparty risk might be characterized as, Do I want to lend at term to you?  I have no doubt that balance sheet pressures are important.  Bank balance sheets are under pressure from two sides.  On one side, capital is being eroded by mark -to-market losses and higher loan -loss provisions, and there is the risk that more such losses are ahead.  On the other side, bank balance sheets are growing as banks are limited in their capacit y to securitize nonconforming mortgages or to  sell off leveraged loan commitments and as assets that formerly had been off balance sheet, such as those in financial conduits and SIVs  (structured investment vehicles), have come back on board.  The balance sheet pressure is most evident in the shift in the composition of bank assets.  Exhibit 9 shows the year- over-year growth rate in the balance sheets of U.S. commercial banks for commercial and industrial loans and for other securities —that is, securities other than Treasuries and agencies.  On a year-over-year basis, commercial and industrial loans outstanding are now growing at an annual rate of nearly 20  percent, and other securities holdings are rising at an annual rate of more than 30 percent.  To make r oom for these assets and to restrain the pace of aggregate balance sheet growth, banks have cut their holdings of Treasuries and agencies.  As shown in exhibit 10, these securities holdings have declined at an annual rate of nearly 10 percent over the past  year.  Thank you.  I would be happy to take any questions.  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you, Bill.  If you have questions for Bill, please raise your hand.  Okay.  I don’t see any questions.  So, Brian, why don’t we go on to the next stage. MR. MADIGAN.  Gi ven the circumstances that Bill discussed, policymakers might wish to explore possible  policy measures that might help address the strains in bank funding markets.  A range of options that involve the discount window could be considered.  These options might include (1) a temporary reduction in the spread between the primary credit rate and the target federal funds rate; (2) the adoption of a term credit program, under which term credit could be extended, potentially at a lower rate than the primary credit rate, at a borrower’ s initiative ; and (3) the adoption of a term auction facility  (TAF) at which term discount window funds would be auctioned at the System’s initiative.   All these options share the potential advantage that their announcement would provide a highly visible signal of the Federal Reserve’s willingness to provide adequate liquidity to promote market functioning.  At the same time, it is clear that what ails financial markets now is not simply a shortage of liquidity.  There are more fundamental problems of credit losses, credit risk, and balance sheet capacity that these options cannot address.  But easing banks’ concerns about access to liquidity could be helpful in the current circumstances.  I will now briefly summarize the advantages and disadvantages of each of these options.  Of course, various combinations of these options are also possible, at least in principle; but the marginal effectiveness of exercising multiple options is not clear , and rolling out more than one initiative might ru n the risk of suggesting a greater degree of concern on the part of the Federal Reserve than is actually the case.   December 6, 20075 of 51The first option is a reduction in the primary credit rate that would temporarily narrow the spread of that rate over the target federal fun ds rate, say to 15 or 25 basis points.  This approach has several possible advantages.  First, from one perspective it has the lowest operational risk, as it does not involve the creation of new discount window facilities ; and by the same token , it does not require a lightning campaign to educat e banks on the characteristics of a new facility.  Second, this approach is simpler for the general public to understand.  Third, this approach would be relatively easy to coordinate with parallel foreign central ban k actions to reduce the spreads on their own lending facilities —assuming that they were inclined to do so.  A reduction in the primary credit spread has some disadvantages.  These disadvantages relate primarily to the difficulty in predicting the reaction of banks to the change.  First, it is quite possible that the stigma of borrowing at the window would persist or even intensify.  If so, a reduction in the primary credit spread would likely be ineffective in stemming money market pressures.  Conversely, i t is also possible that banks will respond nonlinearly to the reduction in the spread and demand quite large amounts of primary credit.  Given the unpredictability of the banks’ demand for discount window funding, the Desk could experience significant diff iculties in reserve management under the approach of reducing the primary credit spread.  Another option would be to establish a term credit facility, under which banks could come to the window at their own volition for fixed-term discount window loans, sa y of twenty- eight -day maturities.  This option was not covered in the memorand ums that you recently received.  These loans could well be priced differently from  primary credit, partly to help sharpen the distinction from primary credit.  This option shares some of the potential drawbacks with the first option that I discussed.  In particular, it is difficult to predict how banks would react.  In order to help guard against the effects of abrupt and large increases in discount window borrowing that would com plicate reserve management, the Federal Reserve could require the borrower to provide advance notice of, say, two days before drawing funds.  Even with this notice, however, such a program might risk triggering very large demands for discount window credit whose absolute size could pose reserve management difficulties and balance sheet issues for the Federal Reserve.  Reducing this risk might require applying limits on individual banks’ borrowing through some form of rationing.  Determining such limits and explaining them to the banks and the public would complicate the design, exposition, and implementation of this program.  The third option that might be considered is a term auction facility.  This program would be generally similar to the auction credit f acility discussed by policymakers in September.   The TAF has several advantages relative to the other two options.  First, it would allow the Federal Reserve to retain close control over the supply of reserves because we would determine the auction amounts—at least assuming that the minimum bid rate is not binding.  Second, the facility arguably has a better chance of avoiding stigma, partly because the auction format implies that no institution is being forced to borrow.  Third, each auction would reveal information about the strength of the demand for funds.  Finally, a TAF could also have potential longer- run benefits for managing reserves and conducting monetary policy both in routine circumstances December 6, 20076 of 51"
102,20071211,"they will allocate $20 billion in two tranches  to European banks needing dollars at the price that clears the U. S. TAF , so they may have to ration or otherwise allocate.  T hat is their problem.   The Swiss National Bank will also do a $4 billion one- time auction.  Let’s see, they are going to do an actual auction. MR. KOHN.  Are they?   I think with a reservation pric e. VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER .  With a reservation price is our understanding. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  At our stop- out rate?  MR. SHEETS .  The minimum bid will be one-month OIS. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  So they have the same auction plan that we have, essentially.  In addition, we are being joined by the British, who are doing two auctions of £10 billion each before year-end.  These are sterling auctions, not dollar auctions, but they are in fact of the same actual size as ours —an indication of the appreciation of the pound.  Finally, the Canadians were already planning to do some auctions before  the end of the year, and they will simply join us in announcing those at the same time.  In addition, the Japanese and the Swedes, although not planning anything in the near term, will issue statements supporting our actions and affirming their willingness to support liquidity as necessary.  So I am hopeful.  Again, I think our expectations should be modest.  This is not a one-shot deal.  W e will continue to try to a ddress these problems, but I am hopeful that the international aspect of this will also be at least somewhat reassuring to markets.   There will be , I think, a bit of disappoint ment today that we don’t cut the discount rate spread; b ut by tomorrow morning, I hope that will be resolved one way or an other. A few people have asked about informing their boards.  I have no objection to your informing your board if you wish in advance of the announcement—so long, of course, as it is December 11, 20074 of 138with the usual confidential ity rules.  What I might suggest to you to consider is that perhaps a compromise between doing nothing and informing your whole board might be to give a call to your chairman sometime  today and just give a heads-up, if you choose.  I am just indicating that we have no objection, to your doing that. There is one piece of business remaining associated with this, which is that we have to approve the $4 billion swap  request from the Swiss National Bank.  What I would propose to do is allow Bill to begin his report on Desk operations.  Subsequent to that, we can take questions, either on the financial conditions that Bill describes, on any of these aspects, and then I would like, along with the ratification of operations, to ask you at that time also for a vote on the swap .  So if there is no question or comment at this point, I will turn to Bill.  MR. DUDLEY.1  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I will be referring to the exhibits that you should have in front of you.  Over the past few months, the outlook for residential housing has continued to darken.  Rising inventories and tightening credit standards have led to outright declines in home prices in many major housing markets.  The deterioration in the subprime mortgage space continues.  As shown in exhibit 1, delinquency and foreclosure rates for subprime mortgages continue to rise very quickly ; and as before, the degree and the pace of deterioration are much worse for more recent vintages (see exhibit 2).  But most important, the problems in residential mortgages can no longer be thought of as a subprime or even an alt -A mortgage problem.  As shown in exhibit 3, delinquency and foreclosure rates on prime mortgages have moved up sharply in recent months.     The ongoing deterioration in the housing market has had a number of important implications.  The first important development is that highly  rated collateralized debt obligation (CDO ) tranches —including so- called super- senior AAA- rated tranches —are now vulnerable.  That is because these tranches typically are backstopped, in part, by lower -rated subprime ABS tranches and other mortgage- related securities product.   For highly rated CDO tranches to be protected against loss, it is important that the average loss rate on the underlying collateral stays relatively low and that the correlation in loss performance among the different assets that underpin the CDO stays low.  Unfortunately, for many of the CDOs issued in 2006 and 2007, these conditions no longer apply.  As housing has deteriorated, not only have expected loss rates climbed , but the correlation among the assets within CDOs has also moved sharply higher.  This has occurred because a growing proportion of BBB- rated  and A-rated ABS tranches now appear likely to suffer losses.  At a 10  percent  average                                                  1 Materials used by Mr. Dudley are appended to this  transcript (appendix 1).  December 11, 20075 of 138loss rate on subprime ARMs, many BBB - and A- rated tranches are likely to survive.  There is a dispersion of loss rates—say between 5  percent  and 15 percent —that helps keep correlations low.  But at a 15 percent  loss rate, the same degree of dispersion protects many fewer tranches than before.  Instead, most of these tranches will become impaired.  As this occurs, the correlation rate will climb sharply.  The net result is that CDO tranches that were thought to be safe become highly vulnerable to losses.     Exhibits 4 and 5 illustrate the sensitivity of CDO performance to the mortgage loan-loss rate.  These exhibits summarize a study by UBS of a large number of CDOs brought to market in 2006 and 2007.  Exhibit 4 shows how sensitive the performance of the CDO market is to changes in underlying mortgage loss rates.  The base case scenario assumes a relatively favorable loss experience.  For example, in the base case, losses for subprime mortgages are assumed to be about 11 percent  for both 2006 and 2007 vintages.  In this case, tota l loss estimates for mezzanine CDOs are around 20 percent  and less than 5 percent  for high -grade CDOs.  In the base case, the losses for the super- senior tranches are trivial.  But when loss estimates increase 50  percent  above the base case, loss estimates  on the CDO tranches climb much more sharply.  For example, the average losses for the mezzanine CDOs triple, rising six  times faster than the rise in underlying loan losses , and expected losses on the super-senior mezzanine CDO tranches soar.  In this cas e, they are anticipated to lose about one-half of their value.  Exhibit 5 focuses on how a relatively modest change in the loss rate on the underlying mortgages leads to a sharp shift in the distribution of losses.  In the base case, the super -senior tranc hes of most CDOs are expected to suffer no losses.  However, at the higher loss rate on the underlying mortgages, about half the super- senior tranches are expected to lose more than half their value.     The CDO market is now fully implicated in the housing  crisis.  The rating agencies are now downgrading many CDOs , and the magnitude of the downgrades is often quite large.  As a result, the value of many CDOs has fallen sharply.  This has led to (1) large write -downs at some major financial institutions and (2) questions about the financial health of the financial guarantors that ensure some of the super -senior CDO tranches and that have other exposure to the residential mortgage market.  Exhibit 6 illustrates the large movements in two of the major financial guarantors’ share prices and credit default swaps over the last few months.  Moody’s recently indicated that MBIA —generally perceived as one of the stronger players —is “somewhat likely” to need to raise more capital to avoid a credit -rating downgrade.  MBIA announced yesterday that they are raising $1 billion in equity capital from Warburg Pincus.  The total outstanding volume of asset- backed commercial paper has begun to contract more rapidly again (see exhibit 7).  This contraction appears relatively bro ad-based —it is not just a n SIV story.  The Master Liquidity Enhancement Conduit (MLEC) continues to move slowly forward, with the syndication process having just started.  But the MLEC is not likely to be very large.  SIV assets have already shrunk sharply, and some banks have already taken SIV assets back on their own balance December 11, 20076 of 138"
103,20080109,"the Committee is going forward toward the end of January.  I think that would be very beneficial.  The markets  in part are suffering from just simple uncertainty about whether the Fed is willing to be proactive in addressing the downside risks, and I think if I am able to give some signal about our inclinations that would be quite helpful.  So, in short, the purpose of the meeting today is not to take any  action, but rather it is my attempt to consult with you, so that when I speak in public tomorrow and next week I will be representing the broad consensus of the Committee. With that, I would like to begin with some short briefings by Bill Dudley in New Yo rk on markets  and by Dave Stockton in Washington on the forecast—I think y ou received  materials today—and then give time for Q&A.  Following that, I would like , because I called the meeting, to give you my own views on why we need to be somewhat more proactive in risk management.  Following that, we will open the floor, take comments, and sort of see where we are at the end of the day.  I hope that works for everybody.  Okay.  If there are no comments, let me call on Bill Dudley to discuss the market situation. MR. DUDLEY.1  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I’ll be referring to the  chart  pack age that I hope you have in front of you.  Market function has improved somewhat since the December FOMC meeting .  This can be seen most notably in the term funding, foreign -exchange swap, and asset -backed commercial paper markets.  In addition, some of the risks of contagion—for example, from troubled SIVs and from financial guarantors to money market mutual funds or the municipal securities market—appear to have lessened sligh tly.  However, while market function has improved and contagion risks have diminished somewhat, the underlying strains on financial markets remain severe and may even have intensified.  This can be seen in a number of areas, including (1) the wide spread o f jumbo mortgage rates relative to conforming mortgages, (2) t he equity prices and credit default swap spreads of a broad  range of financial institutions , (3) developments in t he commercial mortgage -backed securities market , and (4) c orporate credit spreads and credit default swap spreads.   Put simply, market participants believe that the macroeconomic outlook has deteriorated significantly and financial asset  price movements broadly reflect that shift in expectations.    Turning first to the better news, term funding pressures have moderated considerably over the past few weeks.  As can be seen on the first page of the handout                                                  1 The materials used by Mr. Dudley are appended to this transcript (appendix 1).  January 9, 20084 of 60in exhibits 1, 2, and 3, term funding spreads have fallen sharply for dollar, euro and sterling rates.   For example, the one-month LIBOR –OIS spread is now 31 basis points, down from a peak of more than 100 basis points in December.  However, the narrowing in three -month term spreads has been much more modest, and neither spread is back to where it was in late October or early November .  Much of the recent improvement is undoubtedly due to the passage of year-end.  But coordinated central bank term funding actions, including the t erm auction f acility (TAF) and the dollar term funding auctions conducted by the ECB and the SNB, appear als o to have been helpful.  The first two TAF auctions went well, with bid -to-cover ratios of around 3 to 1 and stop-out rates below the 4.75 percent  primary credit rate.  Interestingly, term funding spreads narrowed notably on the two days when these auctions settled.  This supports the notion that the TAF auctions did contribute to a lessening of term funding pressures.  Moreover, market participants have generally reacted favorably to the news that the TAF auctions would continue and that the size of the Ja nuary auctions would increase to $30 billion per auction.  As hoped and anticipated, stigma appears to have been less of a factor for the TAF compared with the  primary credit facility.  The stop -out rate rose slightly in the second auction relative to the first, and some less  healthy institutions bid more aggressively in the second auction.  This suggests that, as depository institutions gain experience with the TAF, that  might lead to an even  further diminution of stigma.    As term funding markets have improved, the foreign exchange swap market has also improved in terms of function.  Bid- asked  spreads have narrowed , and transaction sizes have increased.  The all -in cost of funding via foreign exchange swaps has fallen back down to approximate the cost of straight dollar LIBOR  financing.   Improvement in market tone is also visible in the interest rate swap market.  As can be seen in exhibit 4, swap spreads have fallen notably from the peaks reached in the fourth quarter.  Another positive development has be en the improvement in the asset- backed commercial paper market.  The volume of ABCP outstanding has stabilized, and the spread between the thirty -day ABCP rate and the one-month OIS rate has narrowed sharply.  The spread relative to one-month LIBOR  is about back to what it was before the financial market turbulence began in August (exhibit 5).  Bank sponsors have generally stepped forward to take problem SIV assets back on their balance sheets , and this has reduced the risk of asset fire sales.  Also, the roll-up of SIV assets onto bank balance sheets has reduced the risk of further contagion to the money market mutual fund industry.  Finally on the positive side of the ledger, although the financial guarantors remain under significant stress (as shown in ex hibits  6 and 7, there has been no recovery in the share prices or CDS spreads for the two major financial guarantors—MBIA and A mbac ), this has had only a modest effect  on the municipal securities market.  Apparently, investors have decided that the quality  of the underlying municipal securities is quite good —the historical default experience after all has been very low—and therefore have not been that troubled by the decline in the quality of the insurance on these instruments.  That said, any actual downgr ade of the financial guarantors’ credit ratings could still disturb the municipal market, in part, through its potential impact on insured January 9, 20085 of 60municipal bond funds, which use the AAA ratings obtained from the insurance as a selling point to retail investors.   Despite these positive developments in terms of market function, financial conditions have tightened as balance sheet pressures on commercial and investment banks remain intense and as the macroeconomic outlook has deteriorated.  This can be seen in a number of respects.  First, large writedowns and larger loan -loss provisions are cutting into bank and thrift capital and pushing down equity prices.  For commercial and investment banks, the willingness of sovereign wealth funds and other investors to replenish capital has kept bank CDS spreads from widening back to the peaks reached a few months earlier.  In contrast, major thrift institutions face greater difficulties in attracting new capital because their core business has soured.  As a result, their CDS s preads have soared.  The spread between fixed -rate jumbo mortgages and fixed- rate conforming mortgages has climbed again (see exhibit 8).  This reflects the impairment of the mortgage securitization market and the lack of spare balance sheet capacity for commercial banks and thrift institutions.    Second, corporate credit spreads and credit default indexes  have widened sharply in the past few months, with a significant rise registered since year-end.  As shown in exhibit 9, for investment-grade debt, the widening in spreads has roughly offset the fall in Treasury yields.  As a result, investment-grade corporate bond yields have been relatively steady.  In contrast, for non- investment- grade corporate debt, the widening in credit spreads has dwarfed the decli ne in Treasury yields.  As a result, non-investment- grade  corporate debt yields have climbed sharply.  Although actual corporate default rates have remained unusually low, forecasts of prospective default rates have become much more pessimistic.  For examp le, Moody’s announced yesterday  that it had raised its  speculative corporate debt default estimate for 2008 to 5.3 percent  from 4.7 percent  earlier.  Exhibit 10 illustrates that, since mid -October, credit default swap spreads have been rising in both the United States and Europe.   Third, equity markets are under pressure.  For example, as illustrated in exhibit 11, the S&P 500 index declined in the fourth quarter and, up through yesterday,  has fallen about 5  percent  so far this year.  Moreover, the equity market weakness has broadened out beyond the financial sector.  For example, as of yesterday’s close, the N asdaq  index, which has little weight in financials, had fallen 8 percent  this year .  Global stock market indexes  have also generally weakened.    Interestingly, the dollar has been relatively unaffected by the deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook.  After rallying into year-end, the dollar has given back much of these gains over the past week.  But over the past few months, the dollar has mainly b een range-bound as opposed to being in the downward channel that applied for much of 2007 (exhibit 12 illustrates what the dollar has done lately against the yen and the euro ).    As the economic outlook has deteriorated, market participants’ expectations of monetary policy easing have increased markedly.  As shown in exhibit 13, the federal January 9, 20086 of 60"
104,20080121,"agencies.  The problem with the monoline guarantors is that raising  capital  has become much more difficult.  Ten days ago, for example, MBIA issued 14 percent surplus notes, which are now trading at about 70 cents on the dollar.  It’s n ot clear how much additional capital is needed to keep the AAA rating.  The go al posts keep moving.  S&P, for example, raised its loss estimates  on subprime mortgages about a week and a half ago , and this has implications for the monoline insurers in terms  of their capital adequacy.    So the bottom line is that, unless the monoline insurers raise significant additional capital soon, further rating downgrade s seem  very, very likely.  T his has three potential consequences that are noteworthy.  First, in the money market space, a number of money market products are w rapped by the monoline guarantors, including variable- rate demand notes, auction -rate securities, and tender option bonds.  Some of these securities have liquidity support, so if the securities can’t be rolled over , they’ll go to the banks, and this will increase the pressure on bank balance sheets.  For t hose without liquidity support , either they will be converted to longer- dated securities , which the investors will be surprised to find out they are holding, or th e dealers will have to take them back on their books to prevent the auctions from failing.  A second consequence from monoline guarant or downgrades would be to the municipal bond funds.  The loss of AAA insurance raises  the question of what the retail bond investors do.  Do they start pulling out their money and run?  So far things are pretty calm on that front.  For example, last week the net asset values of some of the major muni bond insurance funds actually increased a bit for the week.   So there are no signs of a run there yet, but we haven’t really explored this fully , given the fact that only one major monoline guarantor has been downgraded and that happened late, late last week.  Third, financial institutions have to mark down the va lue of the guarantors’ insurance as their financial conditions worsen.  In contrast, the monoline s don’t have to mark to market.  D owngrad ing the monolines frontloads the hit to capital and potentially aggravates the magnitude of the hit to capital because  market valuations can  overshoot.  So it is not trivial to transfer this  risk from the monoline s to the financial institutions given the distinction that  the monoline s do not have to  mark to market but financial institutions that use their insurance do.  At this point, monetary policy expectations  have priced in  a lot of easing over the near term.  As of Friday’s close, there w ere about 67 basis points priced in through the January meeting at the end of the month and  about 110 basis points priced in through the March meeting (if you look at the April federal funds futures contract ).  There is likely  more than that now given the decline in the equity futures market that we saw today.  So the markets are expecting quite a bit from the Fed.  I’ll be happy to take any questions, of course.  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Are there questions for Bill?  President Lacker?  MR. LACKER.  Can you explain that third consequence of monoline downgrades?  I didn’t quite get that.  January 21, 20084 of 32MR. DUDLEY.  The monoline insurers don’t have to mark to market the consequences of the deterioration in, say, the structured -finance product they insured.  All they have to do is pay out, as it is incurred, the interest that the structured -finance product can’t pay out.  So their losses are going to be realized only very gradually over a long period of time.  There is no sort of foreshortening of all  that into the present.  In contrast, if a monoline guarantor gets downgraded and so the financial institution no longer has the support of that monoline guarantee, they have to write down instantaneously the value of the assets that were wrapped by that guarantee.  So it’s quite a big difference in terms of the market impact as you transfer that risk from the monoline guarantors to the financial institutions that b ought that insurance. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Other questions for Bill?  President  Hoenig. MR. HOENIG.  Yes, Mr. Chairman.  I don’t want to get ahead of what you might be saying, but if Bill could give us a sense of what the markets are doing overseas, I would appreciate just his sense of things. MR. DUDLEY.  Well, the market on Monday morning in Asia was down somewhere around 3, 4, or 5 percent, and it was everywhere, including some of the emerging markets that up to now had performed pretty well.  India took one of its biggest one-day hits, for example, in a very long time.  Then, we got to Europe, and the declines in Europe were actually a little bigger than the declines that we saw in Asia.  For example, the Dow Jones S TOXX 50 Index, which is an index of 50 large European companies, was down 7¼ percent on Monday.  The market went down sharply at the open, it rallied back up a bit during the day, and then it c ame sharply down again at the close.  So for both indexes you are basically at or very close to the low for the day.   Bond markets reacted as you might expect.  Bond markets rallied as people became more pessimistic about the stock market.  In the currency market, we saw the sort of normal risk -January 21, 20085 of 32aversion behavior.  The e uro underperformed, the dollar was in the middle, and the yen appreciated as people were reducing their risk appetites.    I talked to some people about what was going on in Europe.  I didn’t really feel as though my contacts there were focused exclusively on the financial guarantor s.  That  was part of the story, but there were other parts of the story, including the idea that maybe decoupling isn’t going to happen to the degree that we hoped.  Also, part of the story was that the risks of recession in the U nited States  were increasing.  S o financial guarantors got  part of the blame for the stock market decline in Asia and Europe, but that by no means was the whole story. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Other questions?  If not, let me just talk about the issue here.  I was reluctant to call this meeting, b oth because of the holiday and because the Committee did express a preference on January 9 for not moving between regularly scheduled  meetings and I accepted that judgment on January 9.  However, I think there are times when events are just moving too fast for us to wait for the regular meeting.  I know it is only a week away, but seven trading days is a long time in financial markets.  As Bill described, over the holiday, global stock markets have been falling very sharply, both in Asia and in Europe.  As he mentioned, even though the U.S. markets are closed, the S&P 500 was off about 60 points today, close to 5 percent.  That makes the cumulative decline in the S&P 500 since our last FOMC meeting 16 ½ percent.   Obviously, it is not our job to target stock values or to protect stock investors, but I think that this is a symptom of both sharply mounting concerns about the economy and increasing problems in credit markets.  On the economy, the data and the information that we can glean from financial markets reflect a growing belief that the United States  is in for a deep and protracted recession.  Moreover, as we saw from the global markets today, the concern is rising that that recession will January 21, 20086 of 32"

DUDLEY.1  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I’ll be referring to the handout that you should have in front of you.  Ov er the past month, term funding pressures for banks have generally subsided.  But the bigger story remains the continued pressure on bank balance sheets, the tightening of credit availability, and the impact of this tightening on the outlook for economic activity.  The travails of the monoline financial guarantors —some of which have already been downgraded by one or more of the rating agencies —have exacerbated the worries about the potential for further bank writedown s and have created risks that some finan cial instruments that rely on monoline guarantees might no longer be viable.  At this juncture, whether the major monoline guarantors will receive the new capital needed to keep or restore their AAA  ratings remains uncertain.    I’ll start today by noting that U.S. and global equity and fixed -income markets have behaved in a way consistent with a darker economic outlook.  As shown in exhibit 1, the major U.S.  indexes  have fallen sharply since the December 11 FOMC meeting.  These declines in the stock market s have been mostly matched abroad, as shown in e xhibit 2.  At the same time, corporate credit spreads have risen in tandem with the equity markets’ decline.  As shown in exhibit 3, high-yield corporate bond spreads are up more than 100 basis points since t he December FOMC meeting, pulling the interest rates on high -yield debt significantly higher.  Investment -grade  spreads have also widened.  But for investment-grade debt, the decline in Treasury yields has been larger than the rise in spreads, lowering som ewhat the absolute level of yields.  Global credit default swap spreads have also increased sharply, as shown in                                                  1 The materials used by Mr. Dudley are appended to this transcript (appendix 1).

106,20080310,"type of coordination similar to the one we saw in December.   Again, the request is to increase the swap lines and to extend them, and we propose to extend them through September 30.  That requires a vote of the FOMC, and so, again, we have two items for your discussion. I would like to proceed as follows.  I am going to turn first to Bill Dudley and his colleagues in New York to give us a brief update on market conditions and then to outline for us the proposed term securities lending facility and how it would work and what we hope it would do in the markets.  I don’t think extensive exposition of the swaps is  necessary, but any questions are welcome.   After New York’s presentation, we have Bill, Brian Madigan , Scott Alvarez , and other staff here, if you have any questions.  Following that, we would have a go- round and get comments and positions, and then we proceed to votes.  So without further ado, let me turn to Bill in New York to start with a market update and then to talk a bit about the proposed facility.  Bill.  MR. DUDLEY.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Financial conditions have worsened considerably in recent days.  Credit spreads have widened, equity prices have declined, and market functioning has deteriorated sharply.  Although there are many factors that can be cited to explain what we are seeing —including the acute weakness in the U.S. housing sector, a deteriorating macroeconomic outlook, and the loss of faith in credit ratings and structured -finance products—we may have entered a new , dangerous phase of the crisis.  Major financial intermediaries are pulling back more sharply and along more margins than previously—shrinking their collateral lending books and raising the haircuts they asse ss against repo collateral.   For a time, this adjustment was occurring in a relatively orderly way , but we appear to have passed that point about ten  days ago.  The failure of Peloton—a major hedge fund —and the well-publicized problems of Thornburg Mortgage and Carlyle Capital Corp oration in meeting margin calls have  triggered a dangerous dynamic.     That dynamic goes something like this:  Asset price declines —say , triggered by deterioration in the outlook—lead to margin calls.  Some highly leveraged firms are unable to meet these calls.  Dealers respond by liquidating collateral.  This puts downward pressure on asset prices and increases price volatility.  Dealers raise haircuts further to compensate for the heightened volatility and the reduced liquidity in the market .  This, in turn, puts more pressure on other leveraged investors.  A vicious circle ensues of higher haircuts, fire sales, lower prices, higher volatility, and March 10, 20084 of 39still lower prices , and financial intermediaries start to break as a liquidity cris is potentially leads to insolvency when assets are sold at fire sale prices.   This dynamic poses significant risks.  First, it impairs the monetary policy transmission mechanism.  We have seen that in recent weeks in the sharp widening between mortgage rat es on an option-adjusted basis and Treasury bond rates.   Second, as hinted at above, there is a systemic issue.  If the vicious circle were to continue unabated, the liquidity issues could become solvency issues, and major financial intermediaries could co nceivably fail.  I don’t want to be alarmist, but even today we saw double-digit stock price declines for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.  There were rumors today that Bear Stearns was having funding difficulties :  At one point today, its stock was down 14 per cent before recovering a bit.  Third, the problems in one financial market disturb others.  We have seen the problems move from subprime to alt-A mortgages to jumbo prime mortgages and now even agency mortgage- backed securities .  Commercial -mortgage- backed  securit y spreads  and corporate credit spreads have also widened , and we have seen considerable distortions in the municipal market.   The deterioration in market function can be seen in a number of ways.  First, t erm funding spreads have widened back out.  For example, the one-month LIBOR –OIS spread today is 56 basis points, up from its low point in 2008 of 16 basis points, which was reached  in January.  Second, h aircuts for residential MBS have increased sharply, and if anything, the rate of deterioration in terms of haircuts has accelerated markedly in the last week.  Third, bid- asked spreads for transactions on many types of financial instruments have widened, indicating a growing liquidity problem in the market.   To address these issues, the Federal Reserve has responded by increasing the size of the TAF program and by implementing a large, term, single -tranche RP program.  Together, these two programs will likely cumulate to total outstandings of  about $200 billion.  In addition, as the Chairman mentione d, the ECB and the SNB today have submitted requests to increase their foreign exchange swap draws and restart their term funding auctions.  But there are limits to  what these programs can do.  The TAF provides liquidity only to depository institutions—this liquidity is not necessarily passed on readily to primary dealers and to other financial institutions.  Although term RPs do provide some assistance to primary dealers, these operations are limited to the highest quality collateral—Treasuries, agencies, and agency mortgage- backed securities .  Moreover, as both programs are scaled up, there is a large impact on reserves that must be offset by Treasury redemptions, sales, or reverse repurchase operations.  Frankly, t here are limits to our ability to adjust our portfolio quickly without our actions becoming a source of disruption to financial markets.     For this reason, the s taff has proposed a new facility, the t erm s ecurities lending facility , or TSLF.  A memo from the N ew Y ork Fed staff and a term sheet were circulated to the FOMC earlier today , and these documents discuss in some detail this March 10, 20085 of 39proposal.  Let me give a summary of what I see as the most important points.  In brief, this facility would expand the Federal Reserve’s securities lending program for primary dealers by lending securities secured for a term of 28 days, rather than overnight, by a pledge of other securities—T reasuries, agencies, agency mortgage-backed securities , or AAA -rated private- label mortgage- backed securities .  The la st category  is not currently eligible  for open market operations (OMO).  Currently, our securities lending program is overnight and exchanges only Treasuries for Treasuries.   The purpose of this facility is to help alleviate the rapidly escalating pressures evident in term collateral funding markets.   So how would this facility help to accomplish this?  By providing the ability to swap illiquid mortgage -backed collateral for Treasury securities, the program would reduce the uncertainty among dealers about their abili ty to finance such collateral.  The expanded supply of Treasuries obtained in the collateral swaps would improve the ability of primary dealers to finance the positions on their balance sheets.  This should, in turn, increase the willingness of dealers to make markets across a range of securities.  Better market -making, in turn, should lead to greater liquidity for these securities.  This, then, should reduce price volatility and obviate the need for dealers to assess higher haircuts against such securities .  The liquidity option provided by the TSLF should reduce liquidity risk more generally.  The program should help slow, or even reverse, the dynamic process of reduced liquidity, greater price volatility, higher haircuts, margin calls, and forced liquidation.    Why does the staff recommend that the scope of collateral be broader than OMO -eligible collateral?   The staff believes that a program based only on OMO collateral could help improve liquidity in those markets.  An improvement in liquidity in these core markets could help other related markets.   Despite this, the staff recommends that the TSLF go one step further and also accept AAA- rated private- label  residential -mortgage- backed  securities  in this program .  The staff believes that it is important to  take this additional step because the level of dysfunction in the non- agency mortgage -backed securities  market is pronounced, this market is large, and steps to improve market function in this asset class are likely to have positive consequences for the availability and the cost of mortgage finance.  In other words, improvement in this area would make monetary policy more effective and would likely generate significant macroeconomic benefits.  To limit the credit risk exposure of the Federal Reserve, the f acility for non-OMO- eligible collateral would be limited to AAA -rated residential -mortgage -backed  securities  assets not on review for downgrade.  In addition, the securities would be repriced daily , and appropriate haircuts would be applied against such se curities.  Why not go further?   Although the SOMA lending facility could be extended to include other asset classes such as commercial -mortgage -backed securities , corporates , and municipals, the staff recommends against such a broader extension for two rea sons.  First, these markets are not under the same degree of duress as the residential -mortgage- backed securities  market.  Second, adding additional asset March 10, 20086 of 39"

Second, the $2 per share purchase price for Bear Stearns was a shock given the firm’s $70 per share price a week earlier and its stated book value of $84 per share at the end of the last fiscal year.   The disparity between book value and the purchase price caused investors to question the accuracy of investment banks’ financial statements more generally.     The contrast in the behavior of investment bank equity prices versus credit default swap ( CDS ) spreads is revealing.  Share prices fell sharply, but the CDS spreads narrowed a bit, indicating a lower risk of default.  For example, Lehman’s stock price fell 19  percent , but its CDS narrowed by 20 basis points, to 450 basis points, yesterday.  This underscores the difference between the $2 per share buyout price for Bear Stearns —less value  than people thought—and  the introduction of the P rimary Dealer C redit F acility (PDCF) —a reduction in the risk that a liquidity problem could drive a firm into insolvency.   I have a few words about the PDCF, before moving to a discussion of market developments since the January FOMC meeting.  The PDCF should help to restore confidence among repo investors.  It essentially creates a tri -party repo customer of last resort —us.  When investors have concerns about the ability of a dealer to fund itself, they are reluctant to roll over their own repo transactions.  The reason is the fear that the clearing bank may not send their cash back the next morning when the overnight repos mature.  This fear may not be misplaced.  If the clearing bank is worried about whether investors will stay put, the clearing bank may decide to keep the cash.   In that case, the investors would be stuck with the securities that collateralize the repo transactions.  The PDCF should break that chain of worry by reassuring the clearing bank that the Fed will be there as a lender to fund the repo transactions.  The repo investors are reassured that the clearing bank will send back their cash the next day and thus are willing to roll over their repo transactions.  At least that’s the theory.  As noted, the PDCF  should provide some comfort to the counterparties of the se firms that these firms will, in fact, be able to fund their obligations.  Yesterday, the major money market mutual fund complexes did roll their outstanding repos with the major investment banks.  However, the jury is still out on whether the PDCF will be sufficient to stabilize confidence.     High use of the PDCF would result in a large increase in the amount of reserves added to the banking system.  I think it is important to go on record on that  because,  if that were to occur , over the short run the N ew York Desk might not be able to drain reserves sufficiently quickly to keep the federal funds rate from trading extremely soft to the target.  We will make all efforts to make the “short run ” as short as possible.  But realistically, there is a good chan ce that the federal funds rate could trade soft relative to the target, especially  through the end of the current reserve maintenance period.  In fact, yesterday we saw that, although it started the day quite firm, the funds rate crashed at the end of the day, and the effective fed funds rate for the day was 2.69 percent.  It depends, in large part, on the volume of use of the PDCF.  March 18, 20084 of 127Stepping back from developments of the past few days, recent weeks have been marked by rapid and, at times, disorderly deleve raging of financial holdings within the global financial system.  As I discussed last week, the most pernicious part of this unwinding has been the dynamic of higher haircuts, missed margin calls, forced selling, lower prices , higher volatility, and still higher haircuts, with this dynamic particularly evident in the mortgage- backed securities  market.    I’ll be referring to the handout from here.  Over the past six weeks, we have surveyed a number of hedge funds and one REIT about the haircuts they face for financing different types of collateral.  As shown in exhibit 1, the rise in haircuts has been most pronounced in non- agency mortgage -backed securities.  But even agency MBS ha ve seen a significant widening of haircuts in recent weeks.  The collateral funding pressures have been particularly evident for residential-mortgage- backed securities collateral.  This is due to several factors including  very unfavorable fundamentals for housing, a high level of uncertainty about the ultimate level of losses, and an overhang of product for sale, both currently and prospectively.  In our discussions with market participants, unleveraged players have been unwilling to step in to buy “cheap” assets for several reasons.  First, there are few signs that housing is close to a bottom.  Second, a significant amount of product sits in weak hands and, thus, could be dumped on the market.  Third, this particular asset class has characteristics that exacerbate price volatility  and, therefore, risk.  For example, when spreads wid en and yields climb, prepayment speeds slow.  This extends duration.  When the yield curve is upward sloping for longer maturities, the rise in duration generates an increase in yields.  The rise in yields also reduces housing affordability, which puts further downward pressure on home prices, increasing prospective losses on the mortgage loans that underpin the securities.  Signs of distress in this market include  the following.  First, a sharp widening in option-adjusted mortgage spreads— as shown in exhibit 2, option-adjusted spreads for conforming fixed -rate mortgages have widened  considerably since the January  30-31 FOMC meeting , though they have come in quite a bit over the past couple of days.  That’s good news.  Second, jumbo mortgage spreads relative to conforming mortgages rates remain very wide.  As shown in exhibit 3, this spread has averaged more than 100 basis points this year.  The current yield on prime jumbo loans is around 7 percent , a margin of about 3½ percentage points over ten -year Treasu ry note yields.   Third, mortgage securities prices continue to fall.  For example, as shown in exhibit 4, the prices for AAA -rated tranches of the ABX 07 -01 vintage continue to decline.   Fourth, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac reported large fourth-quarter loss es, and their stock prices and CDS spreads have performed accordingly (exhibit 5).  The sharp decline in the equity prices has made the companies reluctant to raise new capital , despite the prospects of higher-margin new business, because additional share issuance at the current share prices would lead to massive dilution for existing shareholders.  Fifth, t he yield levels on many mortgage -backed securities have climbed significantly above the yield on the underlying mortgages that underpin the securities.  This is the opposite of how securitization is supposed to work.  This March 18, 20085 of 127phenomenon reflects the glut of supply of such securities on the market and the added risk premium attached to assets that are typically held on a mark -to-market basis.   Although the re sidential mortgage market is the epicenter of the crisis, distress has been  evident much more broadly—with the municipal market fully implicated in the period since the January meeting.  The deleveraging process evident among financial intermediaries operating outside the commercial banking system has led to a widespread repricing of financial assets.  When available leverage drops, risk -adjusted spreads have to rise for leveraged investors to earn the same targeted rate of return as before.  This helps explain why the problems in the residential mortgage market  have infected financial markets more generally, leading to wider credit spreads ( exhibits 6 and 7) and lower equity prices (exhibit 8) both in the U nited States  and abroad.  As leverage is reduced and spreads widen, financial arbitrage implies that all assets should reprice.  The risk -adjusted returns from holding different asset types should converge— recognizing that the degree of leverage that is available in markets may differ across asset classes in accordance with divergences in price volatility, liquidity, transparency, and other characteristics.    Of course, the notion of convergence to equivalent risk-adjusted returns is an equilibrium concept, and we are not in equilibrium.  The events of the past week underscore that point.  But there are plenty of other examples of disequilibrium at work .  For example, for mortgage-backed securities, the losses implied by the prices of the AAA-rated ABX index tranches appear to be high even relative to the d arkest macroeconomic scenarios.  The municipal bond market is also a good example of how market valuations can become unusually depressed when supply increases rapidly.  Then the value inherent in the securities becomes broadly known, this mobilizes new mo ney, and risk-adjusted returns come back down relatively quickly.  Term funding spreads also indicate greater stress within the financial system.  As shown in exhibits 9 and 10, the spreads between one-month and three -month LIBOR – OIS spreads have widened sharply in recent weeks, even before Bear Stearns’ s demise.  We are sitting today at 56 basis points for the one-month LIBOR –OIS spread and 77 basis points for the three-month LIBOR –OIS spread, about the same as yesterday morning.    As you are all aware, we have been active in responding to the growing market illiquidity.  Exhibit 11 illustrates the results of the TAF auctions.  Note how propositions and the number of bidders have increased recently and the spread between the stop -out rate and the OIS rate has risen over the past few weeks.  Even before the P rimary D ealer C redit F acility was implemented this weekend, we were in the middle of a historic transformation in the Federal Reserve System’s balance sheet.  We are increasing the supply of Treasuries held by the public (either outright or borrowed) and reducing the supply of more- illiquid collateral held by the private sector.  Even excluding the uncertain impact of PDCF borrowing, this shift will speed up noticeably over the next month or two.  Our cu rrent plans are  to increase the size of the TAF to $100 billion, scale up the single-tranche RP book to $100 billion, renew and increase the size of the foreign currency swaps with the ECB and the SNB March 18, 20086 of 127"
108,20080430,"Transcript of the Federal Open Market Committee Meeting o f April 29 -30, 2008  April 29, 2008—Afternoon Session   CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Let’s formally begin the meeting.  Let me start by welcoming our new colleague, Jim Bullard from St. Louis, over there in the heartland section of the table.  [Laughter ]  We welcome you, and we look forward to your contribution and to working with you.  I want just to note that there has been some interest in doing more work collectively—Board  members and  Presidents —on various issues relating to bank supervision and regulation.  We have some work streams planned, Governor Kohn will talk about this a bit tomorrow during our lunch, and  we will discuss some of those things.  Let me now turn to Bill Dudley to discuss Desk operations.  Bill, if you would, also talk about some of the  proposals for expanding liquidity support.  Thank you.  MR. DUDLEY.1  Certainly.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The financial market environment has improved markedly since mid-March.  However, concern about the circumstances that led to the demise of Bear Stearns may have provided added impetus to the ongoing deleveraging process.  The result has been improvement in the broader equity and fixed -income markets but heightened term funding pressure within the financial system.    Turning first to the broader markets, improvement is evident across most broad asset classes both in the United States and abroad.  As shown in exhibit 1 of the handout in front of you, the broad U.S. equity indexes have recovered much of their earlier losses.  Although the financial sector still lags behind, financial share prices have, in the aggregate, recovered more than 10 percent  off the ir mid-March  trough.  Credit markets have also improved.  As shown in exhibit 2, corporate credit spreads in both the investment- grade  and the high -yield sector s have narrowed somewhat.  Moreover, global credit default swap spreads —as shown in e xhibit 3 —have fallen significantly.  As shown in e xhibit 4, measures of implied volatility in the Treasury, equity, and foreign exchange markets have decli ned.    Signs of a recovery in risk appetite can be seen very clearly in the subprime mortgage-backed securities market and the municipal securities market, both which                                                  1 The materials used by Mr. Dudley are appended to this transcript (appendix 1).  April 29–30, 20084 of 266had earlier experienced significant distress.  Exhibit 5 shows the price performance of the AAA-rated tranches of the last four ABX subprime vintages.  As can be seen, the AAA-rated tranches have recovered even though housing activity and home prices have continued to decline at least as fast as anticipated.  In the municipal market, crossove r buyers have entered, attracted by municipal bond yields that exceed those available on Treasuries of comparable maturities.  As seen in exhibit 6, although the ratios of tax -exempt to Treasury yields of comparable maturities remain elevated, there has been considerable improvement during the past two months.  This improvement has occurred even though the outlook for the monoline financial guarantors remains poor.  Ambac’s announcement last week of a $1.7 billion loss in the first quarter made—thus far—barely a ripple in the broader market.      The introduction of the primary d ealer c redit f acility  (PDCF)  seems to have helped to stabilize the repo markets.  That improvement, in turn, has caused the equity prices of the four remaining large investment banks to recover somewhat and their credit default swap spreads to fall sharply (exhibits 7 and 8).  The PDCF backstop facility also appears to have helped break the negative dynamic of higher haircuts, forced asset sales, lower prices, higher volatility, and s till higher haircuts that was in place in the weeks leading up to the Bear Stearns liquidity crisis.   Although the collateral haircuts set by the major dealers for their hedge fund clients in our April 9 survey—shown in e xhibit 9 —are considerably higher than in the previous month, our contacts indicate that this rise occurred mostly around the time of Bear Stearns ’s demise.  Over the past few weeks, haircuts have stabilized.    Despite the improvement in the broad market indexes and in the equity prices and  credit default swap spreads of most major financial firms, term funding pressures have intensified rather than subsided.  As shown in exhibits 10 and 11, the pressures have been evident at both the one-month and the three-month tenures  in the United State s, the e uro area, and the United Kingdom.  The additional deleveraging by the investment banks following the demise of Bear Stearns may have intensified the pressure on commercial bank balance sheets or the urge for banks to delever.   The LIBOR  indexes  took a jump upward following a Wall Street Journal  article that alleged that some of the 16 LIBOR  panelists were understating the rates at which they could obtain funding.  The British Bankers Association reacted by threatening to throw out any panelist that was not wholly honest in its daily posting of its costs of obtaining funds at different maturity horizons.  The BBA announcement appears to have provoked an outbreak of veracity among at least some of the panelists.  As shown in exhibit 12, the LIBOR  fixing rose nearly 20 basis points in the few days immediately after  the article.  The dispersion in offered rates between the highest and lowest posting banks also increased.  There is considerable evidence that the official LIBOR  fixing understates the rates  paid by many banks for funding.  For example, as shown in exhibit 13, the all -in cost of FX swap financing into dollars out of euros has recently climbed to more than 30 basis points above the cost of LIBOR  funding.    April 29–30, 20085 of 266The term funding pressures appear to be mainly the consequence of the deleveraging process that is still firmly under  way.  Balance sheet capacity has become strained in three ways.  First, pressures to carry more assets on the balance sheet have increased in a number of ways.  For example, some types of assets can no longer be securitized , and balance sheet assets are created when lines of credit are drawn upon.  Second, loan-loss provisions and mark- to-market losses have cut into capital , at least until recently, faster than  banks have been able to raise new capital.  Third, desired capital ratios have undoubtedly risen as financial markets have become more volatile and the macroeconomic outlook has worsened.  These pressures have sharply pushed up the shadow price of balance sheet capacity , and term funding spreads undoubtedly reflect that pressure.  As evidence, note how the spread between jumbo and conforming fixed- rate mortgage yields  in exhibit 14 has mostly tracked the trajectory of term funding spreads shown in exhibit 13.  Because banks can securitize conforming mortgages but not jumbo mortgages, this widening spread likely reflects the rise in the shadow price of balance sheet capacity.  The term funding pressures have also been evident in the strong demand exhibited in our biweekly TAF auctions.  As shown in exhibit 15, the spread between the stop- out rate and the minimum bid rate has risen sharply since late January , despite the large rise in the size of the TAF auctions over this period.     In contrast, t he demand by primary dealer s to borrow Treasury securities in our term securities  lending facility  (TSLF)  has been less intense.  It is unclear whether this reflects the large and immediate scale of these auctions ($175 billion offered over four weeks) or less need by primary dealer s, who rely heavily on secured repo borrowing for their short-term funding needs.  As shown in exhibit 16, two  of the five  auctions have not been fully covered.  Besides  providing liquidity to the primary dealers, the TSLF auctions have helped to generate a dramatic improvement in Treasury market functi on.  As shown in exhibit 17, before  the first TSLF auction, overnight Treasury repo rates were unusually low, and the Treasury market was distorted by a growing number of security fail ures (that is,  dealers w ere unable to deliver promised securities) and a large number of securities trading special ( that is,  with a repo rate below the rate on general Treasury collateral).    So have the TAF and TSLF auctions been helpful in improving market function?  Although it is impossible to know what the counterfactual would have been without the auctions, most evidence suggests that the se auctions have improved market function.  Although a recent study by John Taylor and John Williams found no statistical evidence that t he TAF auctions have had an effect on term funding, the choices in terms of econometric design made it very difficult for this study to have found an effect .  Interestingly, minor changes in the specification used by Taylor and Williams produce statistically significant results with the expected sign —in other words, the TAF auctions reduced the spread.    They say that a picture is worth a thousand words.  Exhibit 18 documents the Federal Reserve’s major initiatives over the past eight months relative to th e LIBOR –OIS spread.

109,20080625,"Transcript of the Federal Open Market Committee Meeting o f June 24-25, 2008   June 24, 2008—Afternoon Session   CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Good afternoon, everybody.  Why don’t we begin, as usual, with the Desk report and Bill Dudley.  Bill.  MR. DUDLEY.1  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I’m going to be referring to the handout that you should have in front of you.  Financial markets have become more resilient to bad news in recent weeks.  Although the news associated with several important groups of financia l intermediaries —including investment banks, commercial banks, and the monoline insurers—has not been favorable, contagion has been limited compared with some of our earlier experiences during the past year.  Moreover, the types of vicious feedback loops t hat were evident, for example, in early March have  been largely absent more recently.     Despite this, much of the news has not been good.  Looking first at the U.S. equity and credit markets, a good portion of the improvement that occurred in the run-up to the April FOMC meeting has been unwound recently.  The broad U.S. equity indexes  are only marginally above their low points reached in mid -March and the price of the Standard & Poor’s 500 financial sub-index has fallen to a new trough (exhibit 1).  In co ntrast, corporate credit spreads have held on to m uch of the gains achieved after mid -March.  As shown in exhibit 2, the spreads on both investment-grade and high- yield corporate debt have been quite stable recently.  However, as shown in exhibit 3, corpor ate credit default swap spreads have widened over the past few weeks.    Most of the major investment banks have continued to struggle.  As shown in exhibit 4, the share prices of the four remaining independent U.S. investment banks remain depressed.  Furt her write -offs, capital -raising (which is increasing the number of common share equivalents outstanding), and investors’ concerns about the consequences of deleveraging on long- term profitability have all been important factors weighing on share prices.  I n contrast to this poor equity- price performance, credit default swap (CDS) spreads remain much narrower than at the time of Bear Stearns’ s demise in mid -March ( exhibit 5).  The establishment of the Primary Dealer Credit Facility  and the Federal Reserve’s role in the acquisition of Bear Stearns by JPMorgan  Chase are undoubtedly both important factors behind the divergence of equity prices and credit default swap spreads.   Lehman Brothers, which reported a second -quarter loss that was considerably larger than expected, has been under the most stress.  However, in contrast to Bear Stearns’s experience in mid -March, Lehman’s short-term financing counterparties have generally proved to be patient.  The financing backstop provided by the Primary Dealer Credit Facility  has been cited by many counterparties as a critical element that has encouraged them to keep their                                                  1 The materials used by Mr. Dudley are appended to this transcript (appendix 1).  June 24–25, 20084 of 253financing lines to Lehman in place.  The investment banks have begun to rapidly deleverage their balance sheets.  As shown in exhibit 6, the gross leve rage ratios for Lehman Brothers, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley all fell sharply in the second quarter.  This stands in marked contrast to the rise in leverage ratios that persisted through the first quarter of this year.   Regional banks have also come under considerable strain recently.  Deterioration in their construction lending, commercial real estate , and residential mortgage books has caused many banks to raise their loan -loss provisions sharply.  Potential acquirers of troubled regional banks have been discouraged by the accounting requirement that these banks must mark down the assets of the bank that they’re acquiring to the current market value at the time of the acquisition.    The financial guarantors have also been under stress.  Both Standa rd & Poor’s  and Moody’s recently downgraded Ambac and MBIA.  The Moody’s downgrade of MBIA was particularly sharp —five  notches to A2 from AAA.   These downgrades  of the monoline guarantors have a number of important implications.  First, the firms that have purchased protection from Ambac and MBIA will have to take significant write -downs.  Citigroup, Merrill Lynch , and UBS appear to have the largest exposures to these two firms.  Second, the ability of Ambac and MBIA to establish new AAA -rated subsidiaries that would enable them to write new municipal bond insurance is increasingly in doubt.  Most likely, these firms will be forced to go into runoff mode in which they can no longer write new business.  Third, the financial resources of these firms will be strained by the downgrades.  For example, MBIA said that, as a result of the downgrades, it may have to pay out $2.9 billion to satisfy certain contracts and post up to $4.5 billion of additional collateral.  Fourth, the risk of a default or a restructuring event by a major monoline guarantor could potentially unsettle the CDS market.  As shown in exhibits 7 and 8, the share prices of the monolines have continued to slide , and their credit default swap spreads have risen further.  As has been the case for som e time, there remains —even after the credit  rating downgrades —a big disconnect between the CDS spreads of these firms  and their credit ratings.    Despite these rating downgrades, the effect  on the municipal securities market has been muted compared with  the turmoil evident in the first quarter.  Put simply, much of the adjustment in the short- term municipal market—for example, the demise of the muni auction rate securities market and the restructuring of many variable rate demand notes (VRDN) and tender option bond (TOB) securities, has already taken place.  Although the yields on the VRDNs wrapped by Ambac and MBIA have increased sharply, up to now much of this paper has been remarketed rather than put back to the liquidity providers.  The effect  on the municipal bond market has been even more subdued.  As shown in e xhibit 9, the ratio s of 10- year and 30-year municipal yields to comparable Treasury yields ha ve risen only slightly recently and remain  well below the peaks reached in mid -March.  Investors have already been looking through the credit ratings of the monoline insurers to the quality of the underlying tax- exempt issuer.    June 24–25, 20085 of 253The performance of term funding markets also suggests a greater resilience to bad news.  Subsequent to the May expansion of the TAF auction sizes and the increase in the foreign exchange swap lines with the European Central Bank and the Swiss National Bank , one-month and three-month LIBOR –OIS spreads have narrowed significantly ( exhibits 10 and 11).  The decline in term funding sp reads is particularly noteworthy because it stands in contrast to the widening that occurred in the last month of the three preceding quarters—September, December, and March.  The increase in the size of the TAF auctions has also been associated with a dec line in bid-to-cover ratios. A lso, as shown in exhibit 12, the spread between the stop- out rate and the minimum bid rate has been relatively low.  In contrast to the U.S. auctions, the bid- to-cover ratios in the ECB and SNB auctions have risen sharply over the last three auctions ( exhibit 13).  This likely ref lects several factors including ( 1) a reduction in the willingness of U.S. banks to lend at term to European banks—due mostly to balance sheet constraints and (2) strategic bidding behavior.  As you re call, the ECB auction is a noncompetitive auction with the stop- out rate determined by the TAF auction.  As a consequence, increasing the bid size in the ECB auction will not raise the price that the banks will have to pay, and that encourages more bidding in the ECB auctions.  This strategic bidding explanation, however, is undercut by the fact that European banks have also been strong bidders in both the TAF and the SNB auctions.  The introduction by ICAP of a competing measure of bank funding costs—the N ew York Funding Rate (NYFR)—has mostly bolstered the credibility of LIBOR .  The NYFR rates have consistently been within 1 or 2 basis point s of LIBOR .  However, it is unclear how much this conformity reflects the accuracy of LIBOR .  It is possible that the  NYFR respondents use LIBOR  as a benchmark for their own responses, since LIBOR  comes out earlier in the day than when they have to respond.    Demand for the t erm s ecurities lending f acility (TSLF) auctions has also generally been subdued.  Only one of the last nine auctions has been fully subscribed.  This mainly reflects the convergence in Treasury and non -Treasury repo financing rates.  Following the first TSLF auction, Treasury repo rates rose sharply.  Given the minimum bid rates for the s chedule 1 an d schedule 2 auctions of 10 and 25 basis points respectively, the convergence in repo rates has eroded the economic appeal of the TSLF auctions as a funding vehicle.  The $80 billion of the single -tranche repo program has been more attractive as a source o f funding.  Moreover, the PDCF backstop has made investors more willing to finance the non- Treasury collateral held by the investment banks and other primary dealers, and this has also reduced the demand for TSLF borrowing.    The continued rise in commodi ty prices has been another important market development.  As shown in exhibit 14, both energy and agricultural prices have been rising sharply.  Although the weakness of the dollar has often been cited by analysts as a causal factor behind the surge in com modity prices, the recent rise in energy and food prices has been accompanied by a slightly stronger, rather than weaker , dollar (exhibit 15).  Nevertheless, short-term movements in the dollar and oil prices do June 24–25, 20086 of 253"
110,20080724,"The reason s I thought that we should discuss this now instead of waiting for the meeting in a couple of weeks are, first, that there is considerable interest in what we are going to do with  these various facilities and already some reporting about them , and I think it is better for us to get this out sooner rather than later.  If we dec ide today to take these steps —in particular , if we decide to lengthen the TAF —for purposes of coordinating with ECB , they would have to get approval from their governors as well.  The bottom line is that our announcement would be next Wednesday morning, so we would not be quite ready to announce for a few more days.  In addition, because I do want everyone to  have a chance to give their views  and we have only a one-day meeting coming up, I thought it would be better to get this done before the FOMC meeting .  Again, the issue at hand is whether to make these two additional modifications to our liquidity program. I am going to turn to New York and ask Bill Dudley to brief us on these proposals.  He will be assisted by Debb y Perelmuter and Sandy Krieger .  After that, there will be time for Q&A with them ; with  Brian , who is here; with  Scott Alvarez ; or with  anyone on the staff.  Following that, we will have an opportunity for discussion.  The votes are actually kind of complicated because the responsibilities for these programs are divided in various ways between the Board and the FOMC.  B ut we will get to that, I gue ss, at the appropriate time.   So let me now turn over the meeting to Bill Dudley.  Bill.  MR. DUDLEY.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As outlined in the memo circulated earlier to the Committee from Brian and myself, the staff is proposing two innovations to our suite of liquidity facilities.   First , we are proposing to add a $50 billion options program to the TSLF.  There is a precedent for this.  We auctioned options in advance of Y2K.  This  proposal calls for selling options to primary dealers in a series of auctions beginning several weeks before each quarter-end.  The options would be for the right to borrow Treasuries from the SOMA portfolio in exchange for schedule 2 collateral for a short period of time (a week or so) over the quarter-end period.  If the option is  exercised, the dealer would pay a fixed rate for the borrowing (we have currently penciled in this rate at 25 basis points, annualized —the same as July 24, 20084 of 50the minimum bid rate on 28-day TSLF borrowing).  The fine points of the program, such as the rate an d the precise timing and tenor of the borrowing that the options would reference, would be determined after consultation with the primary dealer community.  As you recall, in the rollout of the original TSLF program, we consulted with the dealer community after the program was announced.  The dealer comments did result in changes in the program that we believe made it more effective, and the dealers certainly did appreciate the opportunity to have their views heard before the program was implemented.  We an ticipate that an options facility would be helpful in providing a means for dealers to purchase insurance that could be used to secure funding over stress periods such as quarter- end and year -end.  Because the options would be auctioned well in advance of quarter -end, dealers should be able to better plan their funding needs over that period.  The options program should help reassure dealers that they will be able to finance their less liquid collateral over these high -stress balance sheet periods.  Greater  comfort on the part of the dealers is likely to reduce the risk of a margin spiral in which forced liquidation of illiquid collateral leads to lower prices, higher volatility, and higher haircuts, which, in turn, provoke further liquidation.  Debby Perelm uter will discuss the TSLF options proposal in greater detail in a few minutes.   Second, we are proposing to extend the maturity of Term Auction Facility  loans to 84 days from 28 days.  The size of the total program would remain unchanged at $150 billion.  The auction cycle would remain biweekly, with the size of each auction cut proportionately to the rise in maturity—to $25 billion per auction in six biweekly cycles covering 12 weeks from the current program of $75 billion in two biweekly cycles covering  four weeks.  We also are proposing to change our overcollateralization rules.  In the current program, we require that TAF bids must not exceed 50  percent  of pledged collateral.  But the overcollateralization can be withdrawn after the loans are made.  Un der the new rules, we would change this standard so that the sum of all outstanding term TAF and term PCF loans could not exceed 75  percent  of available collateral, both initially and throughout the term of the loans.  As the Chairman noted, the ECB and th e SNB have indicated that they will modify their programs accordingly.  The ECB is seeking to raise its swap line authority to $60 billion from $50 billion.  They are seeking to do this because the current swap line of $50 billion is not easily divisible into a six  biweekly auction cycle.  We anticipate that they will decide to raise their biweekly auction size to  either $9 billion  or $10 billion—so the total swap draw is likely to rise to either $54 billion or $60 billion.  The motivation for the maturity extension is provide greater support to term funding markets.  For some time, banks have asked for longer- term maturity TAF loans.  This is attractive to them for two reasons:  ( 1) almost all of these loans will extend over quarter-ends—periods in which ba lance sheet stress is likely to be greatest —and ( 2) the longer maturity would also help banks extend the average maturity of their borrowings .  This change will also put the maturity of TAF loans more on par with the ninety -day limit of the primary c redit f acility.   Sandy Krieger will discuss our TAF maturity extension proposal in more detail shortly.    July 24, 20085 of 50So what will these two programs do?  My own view is that these new proposals are evolutionary rather than revolutionary.  They are unlikely to result in a dramatic improvement in term funding conditions.  However, they are likely to be helpful at the margin.  In particular, I think they will help reduce the risk of the type of margin spiral that could potentially turn a period of balance sheet stress into something systemic.  In my view, this is a worthwhile goal.  Better to take steps now to reduce the risks of bad outcomes than wait to respond only after the bad outcomes occur.  Introduction of these program innovations also will demonstrate that the Federa l Reserve is actively on the case, refining its liquidity suite in order to make its tools more effective.     Will introduction of these changes be alarming to the market ?  I don’t think so.  Because they would be announced simultaneously with the extensio n of the PDCF and the TSLF programs, the changes are likely to be perceived as an ongoing refinement of the existing programs rolled out as a package with the PDCF and TSLF extension rather than as a program that signals great concern about problems known to the Federal Reserve but not to market participants.    Should we worry that the $50 billion TSLF options program further commits the Fed’s balance sheet , making it more difficult to respond to large, unanticipated PCF or PDCF borrowing?  Although this i s a legitimate issue, it should be emphasized that the Federal Reserve has other means of easing its balance sheet constraints, which the staff has been actively pursuing.  Also, the regular TSLF program has been undersubscribed—currently only $113.5 billion of TSLF loans are outstanding.  This will climb to $123.1 billion tomorrow, when today’s auction settles.  This means that there is a bit more headroom than suggested by the $175 billion size of the TSLF auction  program and the $200 billion that was authorized.  Moreover, in the worst-case scenario of massive PCF or PDCF borrowing, I wonder whether the $50 billion claim on the Fed’s balance sheet represented by the options would indeed be significant at the margin.  Debby Perelmuter will now explain how we anticipate that  such a TSLF options program would work.      MS. PERELMUTER.  Thanks, Bill.  We will propose auctioning the options in two $25 billion offerings.  This will allow dealers to adjust their bidding behavior in response to the first auction results.  The first  TSLF options program (TOP) auction is currently anticipated during the week of September 1 for the option to lock in TSLF financing over the September quarter- end.  We expect to hold the second auction two weeks later .  These auctions w ill be in addition to our ongoing TSLF auction cycle.  Thus, there will be two TSLF schedule 2 auctions totaling $125 billion and another two TSLF schedule 1 auctions totaling $50 billion that will also span quarter-end.  The plan is to hold TOP auctions a gainst schedule 2 collateral in weeks on either side of the two regular TSLF schedule 2 auctions during the months ahead of quarter-ends or year -ends.  The first of these auctions would be for $25 billion.  If that auction is undersubscribed, we intend to add the unused option authorization to the second auction two weeks later.

111,20080805,"MR. DUDLEY.1  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I am going to be referrin g to the handout in front of you.  It seems to be getting thicker at every meeting.  Since the June FOMC meeting, financial markets have been characterized by two distinct phases.  Until the middle of July, share prices weakened substantially, and credit spreads widened.  The financial sector’s difficulties were at the forefront as housing -price declines continued to pressure this sector.  The IndyMac failure led to uninsured depositors taking losses, and this roiled the regional banking sector.  The equity prices of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac plummeted , and their ongoing viability was called into question.  The passage of housing legislation that provided support to the GSEs then led to an improvement in investor sentiment and a modest recovery in share pri ces.  As shown in e xhibit 1, financial sector shares led the recovery.  However, the overall improvement in the broad market indexes  was very modest, both in the U nited States and abroad (exhibit 2).  Moreover, no meaningful improvement was evident in the corporate debt or CDS markets.  CDS spreads have not changed much, and spreads of asset -backed securities have begun to widen again (exhibits 3 and 4).   Despite intermeeting news that I would characterize on balance as more bad than good, this news did not trigger the type of risk -reduction spasms by investors that have sporadically plagued financial markets over the past year.  Exhibits 5 and 6 compare the correlation of daily asset  price changes across a broad array of asset classes in July to the corres ponding period in March.  The blue boxes denote correlations with absolute values of more than 0.5.  As can be seen, asset price movements have become much less correlated.    Although the mood is slightly improved today compared with a few weeks ago, the underlying news, especially from the financial sector, remains quite bleak in most respects.  In particular, there is little conviction that financial shares have reached a bottom.  This can be seen in the unusually high volatility of financial s hare prices (exhibit 7) and the positive skew in options prices for financial firms, in which the price of a put has been much higher than an equivalent out-of- the money call ( exhibit 8).  Financial market participants are paying more to protect the downside than to participate on the upside.    Merrill Lynch’s recent experience is reflective of the challenging environment faced by financial firms.  Merrill Lynch raised new equity capital and announced that it had sharply reduced its net ABS CDO exposure.  Investors were initially pleased that the company had bitten the bullet, and the share price rallied in response.  But further consideration tempered the initial enthusiasm—and there are more articles on this in the Wall Street Journal  today .  A closer look revealed  some troubl ing aspects of the transactions.  First, Merrill Lynch took an additional $4.4 billion of CDO write -downs from the June quarter-end valuation date.  Merrill Lynch sold CDO exposures with a par value of $30.6 billion to Lone Star for $6.7 billion.  At quarter- end, these positions had been carried on the books for $11.1 billion.  Second, this transaction resulted in a drop in net CDO exposure of only $1.7 billion because Merrill Lynch                                                  1 The materials used by Mr. Dudley are appended to this transcript (appendix 1).  August 5, 20084 of 145provided 75 percent  nonrecourse financing to Lone Star.  Merril l Lynch gave away all the upside on these assets in exchange for a payment equal to 6 percent  of their par value.   Third, Merrill Lynch’s equity issuance reportedly resulted in 38 percent  dilution to existing shareholders.  The dilution was exacerbated by the terms of an earlier share issuance agreement with Temasek , a Singapore sovereign wealth fund.  This agreement granted Temasek a “make whole” provision if, within 12 months, common stock was issued at a price below Temasek’s $48 per share investment.   This result ed in Merrill Lynch ’s paying $2.5 billion to Temasek, which Temasek then rolled into a new $3.4 billion share investment.     Over the past month, the troubles of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have taken center stage.  Rising loan delinquencies for prime single -family mortgages caused share prices to plunge.  This eroded confidence that the firms would be able to raise new equity capital and raised concerns about the viability of the se firms.  This, in turn, intensified the downward pressure on share prices.  As a result, investors began to lose their enthusiasm for the firms’ debt.   Investors in short-term discount notes were uninterested in taking on any potential credit risk.  As a result, issuance volumes fell, and discount note rates climbed (e xhibits 9 and 10).  Some investors in the firms’ longer-term debt obligations—including some major foreign central banks—became unwilling to add to their long-term agency debt and agency MBS positions, and one or two of the central banks actually cut their positions somewhat.  However, longer-term debt spreads did not change much because the loss of central bank demand was offset by buying from U.S. fixed -income asset managers , who believed that the implicit Treasury support of GSE debt was likely to be harde ned ( exhibit 11).  Fannie and Freddie responded by issuing less debt.  To husband their liquidity, the two firms have backed away from purchasing agency mortgage- backed securities for their own portfolios.  The removal of this bid was one factor that caused the mortgage basis—the spreads between the option-adjusted yield on agency MBS and other benchmark yields,  such as Treasuries and interest rate swaps —to widen significantly ( exhibit 12).    The Congress responded by enacting housing legislation that included provisions that hardened the implicit government guarantee and, thus, reduced debt rollover risk.  The Treasury now has authority to lend the GSEs an unlimited amount of funds, the magnitude being constrained only by the debt- limit ceiling.  In respon se, discount note issuance costs have fallen  in the most recent auctions .  However, enactment of the legislation has not generated any comparable narrowing in the mortgage basis or resolved the longer-term outlook for the GSEs.  The mortgage basis remains wide  in part because Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have few incentives to expand their balance sheets.  Although their regulatory capital is still well above minimum levels, these capital standards are under review.  Moreover, because further losses are likel y in coming quarters, it is unclear how long this excess capital will be available to support portfolio growth.  Of course, the two firms could respond by issuing new equity.  However, the low level of these companies’ share prices makes this option unattractive.  To raise sufficient funds to ensure long- term viability would cause massive dilution for existing shareholders.  To put this in perspective, the current market capitalization of Freddie Mac is only about $5 billion.  This compares with  a August 5, 20085 of 145book of business in terms of its portfolio and guaranteed book of $2.2 trillion.  Because the GSEs will likely remain reluctant to expand their balance sheets in the near term, the mortgage basis will probably remain elevated, keeping mortgage rates high.  This will intensify the downward pressure on housing activity and prices, which in turn will lead to greater loan delinquencies and losses.  The consequence will likely put further pressure on Fannie’s and Freddie’s capital positions.  So what’s the bottom line?  In my view, the legislation has helped to avert— at least for now —a meltdown in the agency debt and agency MBS markets.  But the passage is no panacea for ensuring the viability of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac or in enabling the two firms to provide significa nt support to the U.S. housing market.    One consequence of the GSE -related turbulence was a temporary pickup in demand in the most recent s chedule 1 TSLF auction , on July 25 (exhibit 13).  As term mortgage agency repo spreads widened relative to term Treasury repo rates, the cost of borrowing via the TSLF became more attractive.  This illustrates how the TSLF program can act as a shock absorber and reduce volatility in term repo rates.  With the exception of the July 25 auction, the TSLF auctions continue to be undersubscribed with relatively stable bid -to-cover ratios.   In contrast to the turbulence evident in the financial sector, the bank term funding markets have been relatively stable since the June FOMC meeting.  As shown in exhibits 14 and 15, the s preads of one-month LIBOR  and three-month LIBOR  to OIS remain elevated in the United States, Europe, and the United Kingdom.  However, this masks the fact that forward funding rates appear to have risen significantly.  As shown in exhibit 16, the forward t hree-month LIBOR –OIS spread has risen about 20 basis points over the past three months.  This spread is now anticipated to remain elevated at around 50 basis points on a one- to-two-year time horizon, indicating that market participants expect term funding pressures to  persist for the foreseeable future.  Before the crisis, the spread was about 10 basis points.  The U.S. TAF auctions also show a stable trend.  As shown in exhibit 17, the bid-to-cover ratio remains around 1.2 to 1, and the stop- out rate has been quite steady over the past five auctions.  In contrast, as shown in exhibit 18, the bid- to-cover ratio for the ECB dollar auction continues to climb.  As I noted in an earlier briefing, part of this rise reflects the fact that the ECB auction is noncompetitive.  The bids are prorated , and the banks pay the U.S stop-out rate.  Larger bids by European banks in the ECB auction do not affect the interest rate they pay for such funding, and that encourages more-aggressive bidding.  Conversations with the ECB  staff indicate that they are concerned that the outcome could be a bidding spiral.  Individual banks could keep raising the size of their bid submissions to ensure a stable amount of dollar funding.  It is possible that these pressures could eventually encourage the ECB to switch to a  Swiss National Bank type of multiple -price auction.  This would eliminate the incentives to bid more and more aggressively on the part of the European banks.  However, such a change probably would result in a higher stop-out rate in the ECB auctions compared with  the U nited States  or Switzerland.  ECB officials might not be fully comfortable with such an outcome.     August 5, 20086 of 145"
112,20080916,"what is going on right now, how we have responded to it, and what I think the issues are.  Just to give you a snapshot of what has happened since Sunday evening, stocks are down worldwide—4 percent plus everywhere.  Yesterday, the U.S. stock market was down about 4½ percent, and S&P futures indicate a lower opening today.  As you might expect, there has been a big flight to quality, especially into the Treasury bill market.  Ten -year Treasury note yields  fell about 30 basis points yesterday, and there has been a big rally throughout the Treasury curve.  The big thing , where there has probably been the most severe stress in the market , is in dollar liquidity for foreign banks.  As you remember, foreign banks, especially in Europe, have a structural dollar funding shortfall, and they look to execute foreign exchange swaps or borrow in the dollar LIBOR  market to fund that.  There was s ignificant upward pressure in that market —overnight L IBOR  rates today were 6.44 percent —and that pressure in Europe is leaking over into our market.  Yesterday the federal funds rate opened at     3 to 3½ percent.  D espite our doing a $20 billion repo at our normal 9:30 a.m. time, the upward pressure on the funds rate yesterday continued.  It rose to as high as         6 percent in the late morning, and that is why we came in with a second operation of $50 billion around noon yesterday.  To try to have more effect on this issue, this morning we came in much earlier than we normally do—around 8:00 a.m.   We did a $50 billion overnight repo .  The funds rate at the time was trading at 3¼ percent.  I think this means that we are obviously adding way too many reserves for the current maintenance period; but the good news is that, when this maintenance period is over a week from tomorrow, we get a fresh start.  S o at the current time  I think we will see essentially a lot of firmness in the funds rate in the morning and then the funds rate trading  down to zero late in the day.  Where the funds rate averages relative to the target is going to be somewhat difficult to say.  Yesterday, despite the collapse in the funds rate to essentially zero at the end of the day, the funds rate was quite firm relative to the target.  I don’t remember t he numbers, but it was in the 2½ percent range.  W e are going to try to hit the target on average, but it is going to be very difficult.  In the current circumstances,  it probably is more sensible—at least my advice would be—to err on the side of providing enough liquidity to the market rather than trying to be cute and worrying just about the target federal funds rate.   Now, the Lehman filing has also intensified the pressure on Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs in a number of respects.  T he Lehman failure means that investors now view the debt of Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs as having much more risk than it did on Sunday.  This means that these firms need bigger liquidity buffers than they had before, and it does have implications for long- term profitability.  As a consequence, their share prices fell very sharply yesterday.  Morgan Stanley was down about $5 a share, to $32, and Goldman Sachs’s stock was off 18 points, to $135.  Morgan Stanley experienced a modest, but not insignificant, pulling back of their c ounterparties and  ate into their liquidity buffer by a measurable degree.   The Lehman problems also were evident in some other areas.  This is very incomplete, but the ones that came to my attention were money market funds—e specially , the Reserve Fund that had large withdrawals, and they encountered a significant liquidity September 16, 20084 of 108problem.  I am actually not sure how that was resolved, but I think that State Street was in the situation of having to cover a very large shortfall of the R eserve Fund last night.  The r isk here, of course, is that, if AIG were to fail, money funds have even a broader exposure to them than to Lehman, and so breaking the buck on the money market funds is a real risk.  T he capital resources of the entities that are associated with the money market funds often are quite modest, so their ability to top up the money funds and keep them whole is quite limited.  Thus the money market funds are definitely one important issue in  how this contagion could be broader.  The second issue is the people who are dealing with Lehman and who have positions with Lehman as their counterparty and how they wind up those positions.  As you know, the parent filed for bankruptcy, but the U.S. broker- dealer is still in operation.  But being in operation doesn’t mean that they are necessarily conducting business in a normal way.  One issue that has received a lot of attention is from some of the asset managers on their mortgage TBA positions with Lehman.  Apparently, the sell side can net these up pretty easily through  the FICC  (Fixed Income Clearing Corporation), but the asset managers have positions with Lehman to either take on mortgage-backed securities or to sell mortgage -backed securities on a forward basis, and they are not really sure what those positions are going to be when we get to that date.   Lehman was not executing those trades yesterday, and so these asset managers are in  the very unfortunate position of not knowing what to do.  Do they offset their Lehman position with a trade elsewhere or not?  So that has been another very open -ended issue for the market.   In terms of market function yesterday , it was manageable in the sense that markets did trade.  But I think it is much too soon to think that we are going to make it through just based on yesterday’s m ove because that  move, even though it wasn’t particularly severe in terms of , for example, the share price movement, did cause quite a bit of damage, and people are still pulling away.    Of course, we also have the issue of AIG.  The AIG problem is at least starting as a liquidity crisis.  The problem with AIG is that the parent company doesn’t have a lot of liquidity resources and doesn’t have easy ability to funnel liquidity up from their subsidiaries because most of the subsidiaries are regulated entities.   So AIG is running into two problems:  One, they are unable to roll their commercial paper and, two, as their ratings are downgraded —they were downgraded by Moody’s yesterday, I think from AA minus to A minus, but don’t quote me on that—they have to post a lot more collateral against their derivatives exposures and also with respect to their GIC (guaranteed investment contract ) business.  So AIG is in a situation in which the parent is basically going to run out of money—today, tomorrow, Thursday, or ve ry, very soon.  Now we say it’s a liquidity thing, but a lot of times when people look closer at the books they find out that the liquidity crisis may also be a solvency issue.  I think it is still a little unclear  whether AIG’s problems are confined just to liquidity.  It also may be an issue of how much this company is really worth .  Finally, let me talk a bit about the facilities that we introduced over the weekend.  Basically, we did two things.  We broadened the P rimary D ealer C redit Facility (PDCF) si gnificantly in terms of collateral eligibility .  Whereas , before, the PDCF September 16, 20085 of 108took investment- grade  securities only, we broadened it to include basically  everything that is in the tri- party repo system.  W e felt that , by backstopping the tri-party repo system  completely , we would reassure tri -party investors that they didn’t face rollover risk, and so we would keep tri-party investors investing with the banks.  That seems to be mostly what happened, at least yesterday.  We did get quite a bit of PDCF  borrowing yesterday evening, but it was predominantly Lehman.  It was about $28 billion of Lehman borrowing.  I think the total borrowing was something on the order of $42 billion.  That is telling you that most of the borrowing we had was associated with Lehman ’s not being able to roll over their tri-party repo positions with their investors.  We don’t really know the reasons for the other borrowing, but it probably was mostly to test the facility as opposed to actual need.   So broadening the PDCF  collateral eligib ility does seem to be working, so far at least, in keeping tri -party investors in the game and continuing to provide funds to the other primary dealers.  The second thing we did was to the T erm S ecurities Lending F acility  (TSLF) .  In terms of the collateral requirements , that had been AAA- rated  RMBS, CMBS , and asset -backed securities .  We broadened  that collateral , so the terms are now the same as the old P rimary  Dealer C redit F acility .  We think that there is quite a bit of collateral that the primary dealers have in t hose AA, A, and BBB classes of  asset -backed securities, CMBS, and RMBS.  So we think that is going to provide more support to the primary dealers in terms of funding their liquid collateral in this environment.  We also increased the size.  Th e original authorization was for $200 billion.  Our auction schedule had been  $175 billion, and we put that $25 billion increase into s chedule 2.  Remember, there are s chedules 1 and 2.  Schedule 1 is Treasuries and agencies.  Schedule 2 is Treasur ies, agencies , and this other stuff.  So the schedule 2 auctions are going to go up in size, and we frontloaded that increase because the T SLF has not been fully subscribed.  We are actually going to be able to do two TSLF schedule 2 auctions this week of $35 billion, s o we are going to get quite a bit of TSLF liquidity into the market this week, which we think will also be helpful.  So that is where things stand.  Otherwise, I think things in the market are doing what you would expect.  There is a flight to qu ality.  Th e Japanese yen and the Swiss franc  are outperforming.  The dollar is sort of in the middle, and the high-yielding currencies continue to be under pressure.  But that is just what we have seen for the last year underlying the se risk trades.   I have a lot more material, so if you ask questions I can get into that.  But I think I will just leave it there.   CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Questions for Bill?  President Rosengren. MR. ROSENGREN.  Just an amplification on the State Street situation.  My understanding i s that no money actually went out.  There was $20 billion in withdrawals that came in late in the day.  They had a $7 ½ billion credit line.  State Street had enough collateral to September 16, 20086 of 108"
113,20080929,"All of the foreign central banks that have obtained dollar swap lines in response to dollar funding pressures in their home markets have decided, with some encouragement on our part , to seek an increase in the size of these swap line authorizations .  We just have to hear from the Bank of Japan —I think that’s the only one that’s outstanding —but we expec t to hear that shortly.  The actual draws on these lines may turn out to be considerably less, and the amounts that are actually drawn are likely to depend on market conditions.  The large increase in authorization should be considered as insurance in case market conditions continue to deteriorate and as reassurance to market participants that the world’s major central banks are determined to respond in force to mitigate dollar funding pressures.  By foreign central banks, the current lines are being double d for the larger participants and tripled for the smaller participants.  The increases are as follows, very quickly:   the Bank of Canada, $30 billion from $10 billion;  the Bank of England, $80 billion from $40 billion;  the Bank of Japan, $ 120 billion from $60 billion; the National Bank of Denmark, $15 billion from $ 5 billion;  the ECB, $240 billion from $ 120 billion; the Bank of Norway, $15 billion from $5 billion ; the Reserve Bank of Australia, $30 billion from $10 billion ; the Swedish Riksbank, $30 billion  from $10 billion ; and the Swiss National Bank, $ 60 billion from $30 billion .  Adding up all of this would result in an increase in our swap line authorization to $620 billion from $ 290 billion previously.  I think that t hese decisions have been made in response to the increasing turmoil evident in interbank markets, especially for dollar funding ; and by increasing the size of the authorization significantly, the intention is to reassure market participants that sufficient dollar funding will be available w ell into 2009.   The staff believes that these large increases are appropriate to reassure market participants that the world’s central banks are prepared to take extraordinary steps as needed to address ongoing strains in financial markets.  These strains are evident in a number of ways.  First, we’ve seen a sharp rise in overnight dollar funding rates and in term LIBOR –OIS spreads.  For example, on Friday, the three -month LIBOR –OIS spread was over 200 basis points, and in fact, LIBOR may actually understate the degree of funding pressure.  The NYFR index, which is  the U.S.- based alternative to L IBOR , has actually been much higher than LIBOR  over the past week or two.  So LIBOR actually may be understated.   Second, there have been many anecdotal reports of a  withdrawal of counterparties ’ willingness to engage in term funding activity.  So the tenor of almost all activity in the market now is overnight.   Third, there are growing liquidity strains at major financial institutions.  Obviously , Wachovia is part of  that story.   Fourth, we’ve seen a significant rise in the demand for our TSLF and TAF credit.  For example, the stop -out rate for the most recent TAF auction, which was a 28-day maturity auction, was 3.75 percent, significantly above the one -month LIBOR  rate at the time.   Fifth, we’ve seen a sharp rise in PCF and PDCF borrowings.  For example, on the week ending last Wednesday, PCF credit was $39.4 billion, an increase of about $18 billion from the previous week, and PDCF borrowing was $ 88 billion in the l atest week, up $ 68 billion from the previous week.  Last, European banking stra ins have been increasingly evident in recent days, especially this weekend following the announcement of the For tis rescue and the nationalization of B&B in the U nited Kingdom .  The European banking news has led to a sharp drop in the European equity markets —this September 29, 20084 of 16morning they’re down 2 to 3 percent —and the euro and sterling exchange rates have dropped quite sharply against the dollar, down about 2 percent.   Now, along with this increase in authorized swap l ines, Chairman Bernanke has approved the staff recommendation for a large increase in our term auction facility  (TAF)  program.  W e are proposing two changes in the TAF program.  First, we’re proposing to increase the 84- day TAF auction sizes to $ 75 billion per auction, from $25 billion.  That will start with the next 84-day auction that was scheduled for October 6.  The second change is that the Chairman has approved two forward TAF auctions totaling $150 billion.  These auctions  would take place in November, and they would auction short -dated TAF funds for one-week  or two -week term s over year -end.  Together, these two changes to the TAF program would increase the supply of TAF credit to $450 billion , from $150 billion currently.  The notion is that a larger commitment to TAF funding should help ameliorate market concerns about the availability of term funding and about the availability of such funding over year -end.  The effective dates for the swap lines and all the programs will  be extended, I think, to April 30, 2009.  This would enable the foreign central banks to extend 84- day TAF credit through year -end under their swap agreements.   Obviously, these commitments are likely to put considerable further strain on the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet.  In recent days we have been offsetting the large reserve additions with the Treasury SFP (supplementary financ ing program) cash-management bill issuance.  After this week’s scheduled bill issuance, the total amount of outstanding SFP obligations will reach $ 400 billion .  However, we cannot rely on this program indefinitely because the Treasury’s room under the debt limit ceiling is about $900 billion as of early last week and is shrinking rapidly  because of the S FP and other ongoing funding commitments.   PARTICIPANT .  It’s impossible to hear.   MR. FISHER.  Someone has had a Black Berry on during  the last two  or three sentences.  MS. DANKER.  New York, in particular, could you make sure you have no cell phones or Black Berrys near the micr ophones.  MR. DUDLEY.  I’ll make sure everything is off.  Probably I’m the culprit.  Poetic justice .  Let me just repeat the last stuff on the SFP.   After this week’s scheduled bill issuance, the total amount of SFP obligations will be $ 400 billion.  We can’t keep relying on that program indefinitely , though, because the Treasury’s room under the debt limit ceiling, which was $900 billion as of early last week, is shrinking rapidly because of that program and other ongoing funding commitments.  So that’s whe re the interest on reserves legislation comes in.  Assuming that the Congress enacts that legislation  this week, we will be able to pay interest on reserves.  I’ll leave that to Brian to talk about in more detail.   Thank you.  I’m h appy to take any questions.  September 29, 20085 of 16CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  So just to clarify, we’ll be asking you for the following two actions after the question- and-answer period.  One is, again, that although the Foreign Currency Subc ommittee was authorized to increase swaps, because we are ess entially doubling the outstanding swap lines, we would like to go back to the Committee for a vote , or to hear  your view s, to ge t approval for those swap lines, which pending approval , we plan  to announce shortly, right?  MR. DUDLEY.   At 10 a.m . CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Ye s, very shortly.  T he other thing, which also requires a vote, is that, in order to do  three -month swaps over year -end, some of the three -month swaps would go beyond January 30.  So we’re asking for the extension not for all programs but only for the swap lines to April 30 .  Is that right?  MR. DUDLEY.  Yes.  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  So that’s the second request —to extend the swap line authorizations to April 30 of next year.  With those two points in mind, are there any questions for Bill?  President P losser.  MR. PLOSSER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I was confused about April 30.  I thought I heard Bill Dudley say that he’s requesting the TAF be extended to April 30.  I s it just the swap lines , or is it both ?  Can I get some clarification? MR. DUDLEY.  J ust the swap lines.  The TAF program  doesn’t need an authorization because it is just within the discount window program.  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  T he issue of unusual and exigent is not coming up here because we’re not dealing with any section 13(3) lending to day.  President Evans.  MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I’d just like to review by asking a question.  The swap lines are very large now.  Could we review what could go wrong for our balance sheet in a September 29, 20086 of 16"
114,20081007,"to set up a $700 billion troubled asset relief program, or TARP, market conditions continue to deteriorate.  This is occurring in three broad respects.   First, market participants continue to pull back in their willingness to engage with one another.  This pullback is evident in elevated interbank lending rates and elevated foreign exchange swap bas es and market liquidity more generally.  The one -month and three- month LIBOR –OIS spreads have widened to 271 and 296 basis points , respectively.  That is up more than 175 basis points in the pas t three weeks since the September 16 FOMC meeting.   The all-in cost of dollar funding via the foreign exchange swap market, although bouncing around day to day, has actually been even higher than LIBOR , often by 100 basis points or more.  In addition to the interbank market, the commercial paper market has come under stress.  The breaking of the buck by the R eserve Fund led to a wholesale fli ght out of prime institutional money market funds.  This forced the liquidation of assets , which has led to impairment of the commercial paper market.   Term commercial paper rates are elevated, and the average tenor of commercial paper has shortened considerably.   Second, financial conditions continue to tighten, and in recent weeks, the tightening has been substantial.  Equity prices have plunged both in the U nited States  and abroad.  Corporate bond yields, especially for non- investment -grade debt, have increased substantially.  Short - and long -term tax -exempt rates have climbed, and credit availability has been even further impaired.   On the equity market side, for example, the S&P 500 index has fallen about 18 percent since the September 16 FOMC meeting.  Although there is considerable uncertainty about the appropriate metrics and weights to use in examining the evolution of financial conditions over time, most data are consistent with the judgment that conditions have tightened significantly since the onset  of the crisis, despite the 325 basis point reduction in the federal funds rate target.   Compared with  the pr evious  two monetary policy easing cycles, there have been four important divergences.  First, corporate bond yields have climbed.  In pr evious  cycles, the widening credit spreads w ere more than offset by the decline in Treasury note and bond yields, causing corporate bond yields to fall.  Second, credit  availability has declined greatly in this cycle.  In the two previous cycles, the proportion of banks tightening credit standards actually fell through the easing cycle.  That stands in sharp contrast to what has been happening in this cycle.  Third, housing price declines have been far larger than in pr evious  cycles, in real and in nominal terms.   Fourth, the dollar has weakened actually much less than in the pr evious two easing cycles.   The third aspect of the market that I think warrants  noting is that the U.S. financial sector in particular remains under pressure, especially with respect to share prices and banks’ ability to obtain funding, especially term funding.  Today was a particularly bad day for financial shares, with double -digit declines common for many banks.  The only good news was that credit default swaps actually narrowed a bit, maybe  helped by the introduction of our commercial paper  backstop facility or the fact that we’ve escalated so massively in terms of the term auction  facility and the foreign exchange swaps with our foreign central bank counterparts.    October 7, 20084 of 30On the inflation side of  the ledger , pressures continue to abate.  Since the last FOMC meeting, both industrial and agricultural commodity price indexes have fallen about 15 percent.  At the same time, the dollar has strengthened.  The fall in the commodity prices and the strengt h in the dollar are two factors that have contributed to a fall in breakeven measures of inflation on both the spot and the five -year, five-year-forward basis.   For example, the Barclays measure of five- year, five-year-forward breakeven  inflation has decli ned more than 60 basis points since the September FOMC meeting.  Today it was around 1.5 percent.  The interbank , money market , and capital market  dysfunction, the tightening of financial conditions, and the apparent easing in inflation risks have caused i nvestors to conclude that the FOMC is likely to lower its federal funds rate target in the near future.  Late today, the November federal funds futures contract implied an effective rate for the coming month of about 1.4 percent.  That’s more than 50 basis  points below the current target.   Interestingly, the failure of the FOMC to ease today actually led to a rise in October and November federal funds futures contracts.  Market participants presumably interpreted the introduction of the commercial paper funding facility as potentially a substitute for further monetary policy accommodation at this time.   Obviously, this is an extremely fragile and dangerous environment.  I am struck by the feeble market response to the substantial escalations implemented over  the past ten days.  These include expanding standing foreign exchange swap facilities’ capacity to $ 620 billion from $290 billion; expanding the TAF auction cycles to $ 900 billion from $150 billion; and proposing a major backstop for the commercial paper market.   With respect to the commercial paper market backstop facility, the market reaction today was generally positive, but market participants clearly want to know more in terms of the specifics, especially when the program will be up and operational.  Of course, I’m happy to take any questions.   CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  We’ll take any questions or comments at this point .  Since Bill has covered the financial area, are there any questions for him?   President Lacker.  MR. LACKER .  Bill, you said you were struck by the feeble reaction of markets to expanding our credit programs?  MR. DUDLEY.  Yes.  T he markets didn’t take as much solace as I would have hoped, given the degree of escalation of those provisions.  MR. LACKER.  So what would it have looked like for the m to have taken much solace?  I mean, what prices and quantities would change?  October 7, 20085 of 30MR. DUDLEY.  Well, for example, I would expect that LIBOR –OIS spreads might narrow rather than widen.  I might expect that equity prices would have taken some comfort from our efforts.  So generally I think the reaction was somewhat disappointing, frankly.  MR. LACKER.  Could it be that some fundamentals are going on there that market participants don’t view it as addressing?  MR. DUDLEY.  Well, a fair point is that the Federal Res erve cannot by its actions  solve the balance sheet constraints of the U.S. banking system.  The Federal Reserve by its actions cannot create capital for banks, and that’s obviously one of the problems at the core of what is going on in the financial system. MR. LACKER.  I want to ask you about the LIBOR  spread.  I t’s pretty striking,  but I’m wondering , Do you have data on the quantity of borrowing that’s going on in that market and what that LIBOR  figure  really represent s?  We have a bank in our District th at reports on the LIBOR  panel  but reports borrowing at 1 00 to 150 basis points below it.  MR. DUDLEY.  T he LIBOR  panel may understate the pressure on funding c osts for some banks .  But if you remember , the way the LIBOR  is calculated, it actually is a trunc ated sample size.  They throw out the highs , and they throw out the lows.  T hey get the median of people in that market.   Also, other measures , such as the New York NY FR, have actually tended to be elevated relative to LIBOR , and the FX swap rate— the all -in basis for dollar funding in the FX swap market —has actually been elevated relative to LIBOR .  So I think that what we’re seeing in the LIBOR  market is a pretty fair indication of the strains in term funding markets.  MR. LACKER.  In that LIBOR  panel, ther e are places where you can get individual banks ’ report s.  I haven’t looked in a week, but the last time I looked, the spread between the bottom bank and the top bank was over 150 basis points.  October 7, 20086 of 30"
115,20081029,"this could potentially add to market dysfunction.  I will be referring to the chart package that should be in front of you.  As you all know, the Lehman bankruptcy led to sharp outflows from prime money market mutual funds into Treasury-only funds (exhibit 1).  The result was a collapse in Treasury bill yields ( exhibit 2).  At the same time, the cost of financing Treasury securities via repo fell sharply —this is illustrated in exhibit 3 by the drop in the overnight general  collateral (GC) repo rate.  This increased the incentive for Treasury traders to short Treasury securities that were already hard to obtain because the effective cost of borrowing such securities is determined by the level of the GC repo rate.  As a result, Treasury fails, which represent Treasury securities that are not delivered as promised to their buyers, soared.  Treasury fails were also exacerbated by the withdrawal from the securities lending market of some large holders  of Treasuries,  including some major foreign central banks.  Although Treasury yields fell sharply and Treasury bills were in great demand, the rise in fails resulted in a sharp diminution of trading and liquidity in the Treasury securities market.  The fact that there are severe market -functioning problems in the asset class that is in greatest demand —Treasuries —underscores the scope and severity of the markets’ broader dysfunction.    At the same time, the outflows from prime money market funds led to a sharp drop in the demand for c ommercial paper, a significant rise in commercial paper rates , and a shortening of commercial paper maturities ( exhibits 4 and 5).  Term bank funding spreads rose sharply, with the one- month and three -month LIBOR –OIS spreads increasing to levels that make the earlier peaks look like modest speed bumps (exhibits 6 and 7).  The Lehman bankruptcy caused counterparty risk concerns to intensify.  Moreover, the Lehman bankruptcy disrupted a number of markets because participants in these markets were uncertain ho w to adjust their long- and short-position exposures that offset their open positions with Lehman.  The result was a sharp drop in the willingness of counterparties to engage with one another, especially at term.  Essentially, the result was a massive coor dination problem that has led to a very unattractive equilibrium.  I would put it this way :  “I won’t lend to you even though I think you’re okay because I am not sure others will lend to you either .  I need some assurance that others will lend to you in order to have some assurance I can get my money back if I need it.”  Even though it has been in the interest of all parties to engage, no party has  been willing to go first.    In response, the Federal Reserve dramatically expanded its programs of liquidity  support.  The size of each TAF auction has been raised to $150 billion—the same size as the entire TAF program just six weeks ago .  Fixed-rate tender dollar auctions were implemented by the BoE, the BoJ, the ECB , and the SNB .  The asset-backed commercial paper money m arket mutual fund liquidity  facility (AMLF) and the commercial paper funding f acility (CPFF) were implemented, and plans for a money market investor funding f acility (MMIFF) were announced.  The Federal Reserve and other central banks stepped forward to engage in transactions with a broad range of bank and, in the case of the Fed, nonbank counterparties.  The hope, of course, is that October 28–29, 20084 of 206this willingness to engage will reduce rollover risk and therefore encourage others to re-engage with their counterparties.     At least for now, the escalation in the size of the TAF auctions appears to have been sufficient to satisfy the demand for dollar funds in the United States.  As shown in exhibit 8, the first two auctions of $150 billion have been slightly undersubscribed.  Currently, about $300 billion of TAF credit is outstanding.  Demand for dollar funding in Europe has increased sharply even though the cost is much higher than in our TAF auctions.  Whereas the two most recent TAF auctions were stopped out at the OIS rate, which is the minimum bid rate, the foreign fixed -rate tender operations have been conducted at a rate of OIS plus 100 basis points.  As shown in exhibits 9 and 10, swap outstandings have grown to nearly $500 billion currently.  The ECB swap size is currently about $280 billion, more than half the total amount of swaps outstanding.  The amount of outstanding swaps is likely to climb sharply when the first 84- day fixed -rate tender operations are conducted in Europe next week.     The CPFF fac ility is another important element in the Fed’s program of liquidity escalation.  As you know, this facility provides a backstop for domestic issuers of A1/P1-rated commercial paper.  Issuers can sell commercial paper to the facility at three- month term fo r an effective cost of OIS plus 200 basis points for nonfinancial and financial issuers and OIS plus 300 basis points for asset -backed commercial paper ( ABCP ).  This facility complements the AMLF , which lends funds to banks at the primary credit facility r ate against the ABCP purchased from money market mutual funds.  Yesterday was the first day that the CPFF was open for business, and a number of borrowers issued commercial paper to the facility totaling more than $50 billion.  At the close of business las t week, 79 issuers had registered to use the facility, paying 10  basis points, or $580 million, to cover the potential issuance of commercial paper.  The 10 basis point fee provides a little equity to get the program off and running.   Finally, the most recent facility, the money m arket investor funding f acility, was announced last week.  This facility will provide liquidity to five conduits that will purchase commercial paper and certificates of deposit of designated issuers from 2 a-7 money market mutual f unds.  It will likely be several more weeks before this facility is operational.    The escalation in the provision of liquidity and some of the other initiatives I will discuss shortly have led to a grudging improvement in the interbank funding markets and in the commercial paper market.   Reviewing the earlier exhibits, most term funding spreads have narrowed, but the improvement is modest relative to the earlier deterioration.  It is unclear at this stage whether the modest extent of improvement reflects the limited ability of additional capacity and breadth in terms of liquidity provision to restore confidence, especially at a time that the macroeconomic outlook has deteriorated globally , or whether it will just take time for these liquidity facilities to restore confidence and some semblance of normality to the money markets.    October 28–29, 20085 of 206The expansion of the Fed’s liquidity provisions has been accompanied by escalations on two other fronts.  First, the FDIC announced a bank funding guarantee program.  Although the terms and conditions of this program have not yet been finalized, the program is likely to guarantee most of the new senior debt obligations of participating depository institutions and their associated holding companies up to a cap of 125 percent of the maturing obligations through June 30, 2009.  Importantly, new interbank funding will be covered.  How this affects the federal funds market remains to be seen.  Second, the Treasury has committed $250 billion of funds from the TARP program to inject as preferred stock into the banking system.  Nine large banks announced two weeks ago that they will accept $125 billion of preferred stock investment from the Treasury.  Over the past few days, the Treasury announced that an additional $35 billion of capital ha s been committed.   The FDIC guarantee announcement and the TARP capital infusion have been effective in shoring up confidence in the major U.S. banks.  As shown in exhibits 11 and 12, credit default swap spreads for most major U.S. financial institutions h ave narrowed sharply.    But the guarantee of the senior debt of depository institutions and their associated holding companies has generated some unintended consequences for those firms not covered by these guarantees.  In particular, the credit default s wap spreads for major nonbank financials have narrowed less than those for the banks (exhibit 13).  Moreover, the funding costs for the GSEs have climbed, especially for short- term discount note issuance.  The funding costs for Fannie and Freddie for both long- term and short-term debt are shown in exhibits 14, 15, and 16.  However, the fear that funds would flow out of prime money market funds back into bank assets guaranteed by the FDIC has not been realized —at least not yet.    The expansion of the Fed’s facilities and the open -ended nature of the fixed- rate tender dollar operations by the foreign central banks that we are funding by  swaps have led to rapid expansion of our balance sheet.  Exhibit 17 provides a snapshot of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet at different times before and during the crisis.  During the first 13 months, the size of our balance sheet was little changed.  We accommodated our liquidity programs mainly by selling Treasury securities.  During the next stage, which began around the time of the Lehman bankruptcy filing, we expanded our balance sheet but drained the reserve additions primarily by having the Treasury issue supplemental f inancing program bills and plac ing the proceeds on our balance sheet.  However, the capacity to cont inue to drain reserves via SFP bills was unlikely to be a long-term solution because the Treasury would ultimately be constrained by the debt limit ceiling.    The passage of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 granted the Federal Reserve the authority to pay interest on reserves immediately.  This was very important because it meant that we could expand our balance sheet size by  unsterilized reserve additions but at the same time keep the federal funds rate from crashing to zero by paying a positive interest rate on holdings of excess reserves.  Further rapid balance sheet expansion appears inevitable as the takedown from the TAF auctions and the fixed -rate tenders expands further and as our new facilities, October 28–29, 20086 of 206"
116,20081216,"Transcript of the Federal Open Market Committee Meeting o n December 15 -16, 2008 December 15, 2008—Afternoon Session  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Good afternoon, everybody.  We welcome Chris Cumming, who is sitt ing in for New York.   As you know, under the extraordinary circumstances we added an extra day to the meeting .  The purpose of the meeting taking place today is to discuss the zero lower bound and related policy and governance issues, and I hope that the discussion today will set up our policy decisi on for tomorrow.  Just for preview purposes, the program  today will start with Bill Dudley and Q&A.  We’ll then have a staff presentation on the zero lower bound and alternative policies.  We’ll have a go-round on those issues, including nontraditional poli cies and communications associated with it and so on.  Let me just mention that on the agenda for tomorrow , after the policy decision, we have the subcommittee’s report on long -run projections and the quarterly projections.  We put that there to save time and to make sure that we met our deadlines ; but obviously there’s some linkage between that and the discussion today, and if anyone wants to bring that up today, please feel free to do so.  Finally, if we’re very efficient —as I hope we will be —I’d like to get to the staff economic briefing at the end of today, if possible —if not, not —and then there’s dinner afterwards.   So without further ado, let me turn to Bill  Dudley .  Bill.  MR. DUDLEY.1  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Unfortunately this package is a little thicker than usual, but that’s the way it goes, I guess.  The stimulus provided by monetary policy to the real economy depends not only on the level of the federal funds rate but also on the health of the financial system.  The ability of market participant s to intermediate and act effectively as the transmission channel between the change in the federal funds rate target and financial asset prices is critical.  When bank and dealer balance sheets are constrained as they are now, this transmission mechanism is impaired , and traditional monetary policy instruments become limited in their ability to support economic activity.                                                       1 The materials used by Mr. Dudley are attached to t his transcript (appendix 1).  December 15–16, 20084 of 284The recent sharp deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook and the forced deleveraging of the nonbank portion of the financial sector ha ve led to sharp declines in asset values during the past few months.  The consequence will be further big mark -to-market losses for investment and commercial bank trading books and a significant increase in loan -loss provisions on commercial bank loan books.  These losses are likely to intensify the vise on financial firm balance sheets , and that is likely to further impede the Federal Reserve’s efforts to ease financial conditions.  As a consequence, a broadening of our suite of liquidity facilities that bypass banks and dealers may prove to be necessary.    Equities, corporate debt, and securitized assets—especially commercial -mortgage- backed securities (CMBS) —have all been hard hit, and the commodity  sector, the preferred asset class of choice earlier in the year, has been clobbered.  As shown in exhibit 1 of the handout , U.S. equity prices fell sharply beginning in September.  Although the aggregate indexes  have bounced off their low points, the S&P 500 index had still fallen 30 percent  between the end of August and the end of November.  This is the relevant quarter for Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, which report this week.  In the current calendar quarter, despite the rebound, the S&P  500 index has declined about 25 percent.  The carnage has also been evident abroad, especially in emerging markets.  The corporate debt market has scarcely been more hospitable.  The high -yield  corporate bond yield for some broad indexes  has climbed above 20 percent  (exhibit 2).  Assuming a 20 percent  recovery rate on defaults , yield levels in this sector appear to fully discount a default experience consistent with the peak reached in the Great Depression.   The securitization markets have performed little better.  Not only are most securitized markets shut to new issuance, but also the yields on even the highest- rated outstanding tranches have climbed sharply.  Exhibit 3 illustrates the current spreads for different types of AAA-rated consumer securitizations—credit cards, auto loans, and student loans.  Exhibit 4 illu strates the sharp deterioration in valuations in the CMBS  market.  The left panel shows spreads on a basket of post-2003 vintages.  The right panel shows the price performance of particular AAA -rated CMBS tranches.  Most have fallen about 20 points in the past quarter.      Commodity prices also continue to plummet.  As shown in exhibit 5, the declines have been particularly pronounced in the energy and industrial metals sectors.  In contrast, gold prices have held up quite well (exhibit 6), especially since the October FOMC meeting.  Gold prices presumably have been supported by the drop in global short-term interest rates, which reduces the carrying cost of owning gold.  It is also possible that gold is viewed as a hedge against the risk that central bank policy actions could ultimately prove inflationary.  Presumably, the fear may be that the exit from these policies could be delayed or prove more difficult to engineer than generally anticipated.     This poor performance of financial and real assets has a n umber of important implications.  In particular, the earnings of most major financial intermediaries will be very poor this quarter.  For example, the two investment banks that report this December 15–16, 20085 of 284week are almost certainly likely to record large mark -to-market los ses. The Wall Street Journal  reported earlier that Goldman Sachs will report a loss of around $2 billion when it reports tomorrow morning.  This may actually understate the carnage because compensation booked for previous quarters can be reversed and the reversal of income taxes paid will reduce the size of the loss.  Commercial banks will also not be spared when they report next month.  Not only will they have significant losses on their trading books, but also loan -loss provisions are likely to climb sharply.  JPMorgan indicated last week that the current quarter has been terrible, and they have been one of the best-performing commercial banks.  The sharp decline in asset prices is also likely to reinforce the deleveraging process that is occurring throughout the financial sector.  Although hedge fund performance in November was better than in the pr evious months, preliminary figures show that the aggregate index continues to slide ( exhibit 7).  We’re down about 17 or 18 percent so far this year, and that’s the worst performance in hedge fund history in the aggregate by a significant margin.  Although the redemption deadlines for year-end have generally passed, this pressure will persist into the first quarter and beyond for two reasons.  First, many fund-of-funds managers will get another round of redemption requests before year-end, which will cause them to ask for monies from the hedge funds that are part of their fund-of-funds families in the first quarter.  Second, some hedge funds restrict or “gate” the rate of withdrawals.  For example, Citadel suspended all redemptions for their two biggest funds through March 31.  This means that there will be a backlog in unfulfilled requests that will take time to satisfy.   The Bernard Madoff scandal may also lead t o additional redemption requests.  The losses suffered by dealers and banks mean that their balance sheet constraints will continue to stymie  the Federal Reserve’s efforts to supply liquidity to prospective borrowers.   As shown in exhibit 8, recent TAF auctions have been undersubscribed, and as shown in exhibit 9, the amount of dollar liquidity supplied via our swap lines has stabilized even though term LIBOR  remains elevated well above the minimum bid rate that we charge on those auctions and the fact that  swaps are open -ended in size.  The problem is no longer one of supplying sufficient liquidity to the banks and dealers.  The problem is getting these intermediaries to pass th e liquidity onward to their clients.    Balance sheet constraints reveal themsel ves in many guises.  Although LIBOR -OIS spreads have narrowed somewhat, they remain very elevated relative to historical levels ( exhibits 10 and 11); jumbo mortgage rate spreads remain wide relative to conforming mortgage rates (exhibit 12); and cash instr uments that take balance sheet room trade at significantly higher spreads than  the corresponding derivatives that don’t.  Exhibit 13 illustrates the spread between high -yield  cash bonds and the corresponding CDX high -yield  derivatives index.  This widening in that basis is one reason that some banks have taken large losses in the fourth quarter.  Evidence that balance sheet constraints are impeding the availability and cost of credit continues to proliferate.   This is obviously important because, if credit is not available on reasonable terms, this is likely to exacerbate the downward pressure on the economy.  December 15–16, 20086 of 284"
117,20090116,"January 16, 20094 of 69organizations, so losses for them are taken pretty seriously.  What was most important was a very large loss that Merrill Lynch d eclared for the fourth quarter today, much larger than market expectations—in the mid-20s pre-tax.  The concern was that a large loss on the Merrill L ynch acquisition, which Bank of America just closed on January 1, might shake market conf idence in Bank of America itself. The proposal that Bank of America request ed from us and that we ultimately agreed to provide is in two parts. One is a capital injection of $20 billion from the Treasury from the TARP funds—that is in th e form of preferred stock.  It is very much like the preferred stock that was i ssued in the CPP (capital purchase program) to other banking organizations, ex cept that the interest rate is higher.  It is a uniform 8 percent interest rate right from the star t, rather than 5 accelerating to 9, I believe, under the CPP.  The capital injection has some  conditions tied to it.  One condition is that dividends be restricted to a penny a sh are per quarter for the next three years.  There is also an executive compensation requirement that is more severe than the executive compensation requirements that apply under the CPP but very much like the exec comp restrictions in the Citi deal .  So the highest management of Bank of America, roughly the to p thirty officials, had their bonus es cut 40 percent for the next two years, and their bonuses are based on the 2007 performance.  There are also restrictions on corporate activities, on the use of corporate jets, and on various extra corporate expenditures, which are subject to Treasury review. In addition to the capital in jection, the U.S. government agreed to provide some downside protection for a period of time on a pool of ring-fenced assets.  This part was also modeled on the Citi deal.  The maximum size of the pool is $118 billion.  The pool includes a variety of residential and commercial real estate securities, including some structured instruments—CDOs and the like.  The underlying assets include a range of prime, subprime, a nd alt-A assets.  There are also some derivatives—in fact, a larg e derivative book on real es tate and other corporate assets—and some leveraged loans.  The term  of the downside prot ection is ten years on the residential-mortgage-based assets a nd five years on everyt hing else.  The way it is structured, Bank of America has a deduc tible of $10 billion.  That is the first loss position on any losses in this pool. After the Bank of America loss position, the U.S. government will share losses on a 90/10 basis with Bank of America, the government taking the next 90 percent and Bank of Ameri ca, 10 percent, for another $10 billion.  That $10 billion of losses is shared between the Treasury and the FDIC on a pari passu  basis, which is slightly different from the Citi deal.  The Treasury will take $7½ billion in losses potentia lly, and the FDIC is w illing to take $2½ billion. In exchange for providing that protecti on, the Treasury and the FDIC are getting $4 billion in preferred stock and some sma ll amount of warrants as a premium.  The losses will be based on actual losses that are incurred in the maturity and sale of assets from the pool, not on mark-to-market lo sses.  So if the pool continues to exist after they have gone through that series of  $20 billion in protection, then the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond stands ready to make a loan to Bank of America on the basis of the assets remaining in the p ool.  That loan would be on a nonrecourseJanuary 16, 20095 of 69basis—so recourse only to the assets in  the pool.  Again, Bank of America would share 10 percent of the losses alongside th e Reserve Bank in that pool liquidation.  The Reserve Bank is getting a commitment fee on this loan that begins immediately on signing the documents.  The fee is 20 ba sis points on the outstanding amount of the assets, which represents the potential amount that the Reserve Bank could lend against.  Once the loan has been drawn, th e Reserve Bank would also get an interest rate of OIS (overnight index swap) plus 300. That interest rate is the same that we have used in the Citi deal. The restricti ons that I went throug h on the preferred stock that the Treasury gets are also part of th e asset ring-fencing proposal and will last as long as the ring-fence continues to exist.  That is the summ ary of the deal.  President Lacker may have other comments to make , and I am happy to answer any questions. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Lacker. MR. LACKER. In putting this together, our staff benefited tremendously from what has been learned over the past two months in New York from trying to put pencil to paper and negotiate the details of the legal agreement pursuant to the term sheet for Citi.  We were able, at the margin, to improve in several respects on a couple of the provisions of this ring-fencing arrangement.  In our case, actually, the collateral is n’t going to be the underly ing securities.  It is going to be just Treasuries. But the loan agreem ent stipulates that the repayment amount is the amount of the outstanding balance of the loan mi nus the amount of credit losses they incur on the underlying assets.  In addition, we have a trigger point for advancing the credit that is a bit tighter than before and a c ouple of other minor things. But I want to thank the New York staff and the Board staff as well for doing a great job in helping us put this together. This obviously is an uncomfortable thi ng for any central bank to do. The terms of this deal are very consiste nt with the Citibank terms, so it seems like a consistent follow-through in term s of the conditions involved for the institution that triggered this intervention and the terms and structure of the interventi on.  So we were happy to cooperate with the System in carrying this out.January 16, 20096 of 69CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thanks, President L acker.  I agree with Jeff that this is uncomfortable. It is a significant improvement, I would say, over some of the things we have had to do in the past in that the Treasury obviou sly is taking by far the bu lk of both the capital investment and the fiscal risk and the FDIC is fully engaged as well.  The FDIC also announced its intention to expand the loan guarantee progra m to allow for up to ten-year covered bond type of instruments, which will be interesting.  They  are going to go out for comment on that, and we will see how that works out.  So they are very much engaged. I would make a couple of other points.  One is that we also had the benefit of knowing somewhat longer in advance than had been the case in other situations and so had more time to determine what strategy to follow.  I think the ag reement will reflect that greater time and greater attention. Finally, and this perhap s anticipates some of our later discussion, we have been very attuned not only to the credit risk s but also to the monetary policy implications of these deep-tail loans. We don’t expect to have to make the loan s, but if we do, we want to make sure that they don’t create balance sheet pr oblems in terms of our monetary polic y.  Both in this case and in the final negotiation with Citi, we have worked it out in a way that, if we make loans, it will be on a tranched basis so that we wouldn’t have to ma ke a loan of $300 billion or $100 billion in one shot—rather, somewhat smaller loans that could be better managed from a monetary policy point of view. So that is the overview. Let me see now  if there are any questions for Scott, for me, or for Jeff. President Fisher. MR. FISHER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I have two questions.  You may remember that, back when we first started down this pa th, we had a discussion—a t least I raised the subject—about a decision tree and about our assessing possible outcomes.  I can say this in front of the group; this is an insi de question.  After that discus sion, President Geithner and I had"

119,20090207,"February 7, 20094 of 65But given the schedule for Secretary Geithne r to announce the plan  on Monday, I thought this was an opportune point for us to review th e plan and the Fed’s potential role.  As you’ll see when I go through the plan with you, the details are fairly lacking.  There is  an overall structure.  That, in part, is on purpose. The political strategy  is to provide an overall structure with some  detail, but not a great deal of detail, with the id ea that the public discus sion and the congressional discussion will create some buy-in on the political side.  It’s like selling a car: Only when the customer is sold on the leather se ats do you actually reveal the price.  So the strategy, again, is to provide the framework to get the Congress involved within certain parameters, and then, only when there is some consensus on how the plan w ill work and what the key elements will be, to negotiate whether additional fundi ng beyond $350 billion is necessary.  But I think there are some advantages to that from a political point of view.  I will say that both I and the staff—Bill Dudley and othe rs—are somewhat concerned, at least given the way things stand now, about the market reaction.  First, the lack of details will create some uncertainty and concern, particularly because th ere’s not a great deal said about the “problem children,” the BAC and Citi.  Secondly, I think th e markets will be disappointed in the following sense: As I will describe, this is  a real truth-telling kind of plan.  It’s fundamentalist.  It’s not about giving the banks a break.  It’s not about using accounting principles to give them back-door capital. It’s very much market-oriented and “tough love.”  And I think we all will like that. I like that. But the banks’ shareholders aren’t going to be thrilled about it. As I will explain—and I’ll go through this w hole thing in detail in just a minute—the Fed’s role in the bank stabilization plan per se is minimal.  We may be called upon to do some transition or bridge-finan cing of parts of the aggregator ba nk concept to a more permanent, non-Fed financing, but we’re not invol ved in any wraps or anything  like that, so in the broadFebruary 7, 20095 of 65elements of the bank stabilization plan, we are pret ty much on the sidelines.  Where we are part of the overall stabilization plan  is in a proposed expansion of the TALF to include additional types of ABS.  An important element of that would be that the Treasury will be proposing legislative action to ensure that we can sterilize the effects of any expans ion of our balance sheet on bank reserves; and that would be, I think, a condition for us to fully meet the size of the expansion that they want. I’ll come  back to that in detail, but that, essentially, is where the Fed’s role is visualized.  Let me go ahead now and go through the plan.  I’ll talk about the ove rall plan.  I’ll talk about the Fed’s role. I’ll give you some reasons why I think the Fed’s role  is appropriate for the economy and advances our own narrow instituti onal interests.  Then we will take all the comments and questions that you would like to make.  Again, because this is a meeting, voicing your views is certainly appropriate. The first element of the stabilization plan is summarized as enhanced transparency about asset valuations and capital needs. So there’s a principle here that I believ e to be very important:  The more disclosure and clarity there is, the le ss uncertainty there is and the better the chance that we’ll come to some kind of stability. One part of this first element will be a coordinated supervisory scrub of at least the top 20 banks or so to ensure that we understand how th ey are valuing their assets.  We want to find some consistency in their marks, we want to fi nd consistency in their pr ovisioning, and we want to go beyond provisioning, which is focused on one-year losses, to l ook at expected losses beyond one year. So we’re going to do a tough scr ub of the balance sheets.  We’re going to require enhanced disclosure so that there will be  as much information as possible, with as much consistency as possible, about the balance sheets of the banks.February 7, 20096 of 65Another part of this element is that this is  going to be a forward-looking exercise.  In particular, the standard Basel II regulatory capi tal standards are to some extent going to be subsumed in the following sense:  There will be e ither explicitly or implicitly an analysis of bank balance sheets based not only on the current expectations or cu rrent modal forecasts, but on a stress scenario as well. And the presumption is that banks will have enou gh capital that they will be able to meet regulatory sta ndards even in the stress scenario; that means there will be some presumption of a capital buffer—not a permanent in crease in capital standards, but rather a temporary increase in capital required that coul d be run down over time in order to meet the standards even in a period of extreme stress. The language of the presentation will be something along the lines th at we want to be sure that our most important and largest banks, at  least, and all of those banks are going to be resilient, even in the case of a very bad macr oeconomic outcome.  A fo rward-looking approach gets around the accounting issues about reserving ve rsus marking to market, and we’ll be very aggressive in terms of trying to get a proactive ca pital injection.  They’ll use this scenario to size the capital needs of particular ly the top 20-25 banks, and, more over, we will be looking not strictly at Basel II standards, as I said, but also at market-rele vant standards, like TCE to total assets, as well as the Basel risk-weighted asset st andards.  So Step 1 is a scrub for consistency and an evaluation of the ability of  banks to meet capital standards even in a bad scenario in the future. The second element of the bank program is a cap ital facility.  Of cour se, the first line of defense, to the extent that banks can, is accessi ng private capital markets,  and they’ll be strongly encouraged to do so. Obviously, that is very di fficult except for a very few banks, so there will be a backup U.S. government capital facility.  What  appears to be now the most likely form of"
120,20090318,"March 17–18, 20094 of 26625 percent for the year. Foreign stock markets, which had fallen 15 percent to 25 percent from the beginning of the year  to a week ago Monday, are now down “only” 5 percent to 17 percent for the year. This, of course, reflects the deep, nearly global recession which has occurred in res ponse to the financial crisis.  The sharp contraction in credit is now a global phenomenon, resulting in credit losses, write-downs, and financial delevera ging occurring nearly everywhere. Financial firms also had a bit of a respite last week, in part based on predictions of better first quarter earnings, but overall they  remain very distressed.  The continued uncertainty regarding both the health of fi nancial firms as well as the nature of government assistance programs has weighed on their capital struct ures.  As can be seen in exhibit 2, both common and preferre d equity indexes for financial firms are down sharply during the intermee ting period.  In fact, preferred equity of financials has fallen more than 20 percent since late  January, while common equity prices are down less than 10 percent, re flecting increased risk of  suspended dividends or conversion of preferred equ ity to common.  This trend is even more pronounced for those firms that have already received government capital and, thus, for which the possibility of losses further up the capital structure is perceived to be largest. Perhaps more jarring is the very large widening of financial firms’ CDS spreads in recent weeks, which can be seen in exhibits 3 through 5.  Bank CDS spreads are now significantly wider than they were duri ng the height of the financial turmoil last fall, following the Lehman bankruptcy. This is truly extraordinary in light of the government programs that have been announced  or expanded in recent weeks:  the FDIC guarantee program, the announcement of the Administration’s stabilization plan, and several public statements that systemically important firms will not be allowed to fail during the current crisis. The widening of CDS spreads reflects several factors.  First, in the U.S., there is deep concern that the current bank stress as sessment will result in actual or de facto nationalization of some institutions; this raises  the possibility that debt holders as well as equity holders will take a hit. Sec ond, financial firms with more opaque balance sheets—commercial banks, insurance companies, and some finance companies, such as GE Capital—have experienced larger in creases in CDS spreads.  The lack of clarity about the size of “toxic” assets and how legacy accrual assets will be marked has led to questions about thei r viability.  In fact it’s notable that the CDS spreads of the two former investment banks, which larg ely mark their balance sheets to market, have not widened in recent weeks, although they remain at very high levels.  Third, market liquidity continues to deteriorate in  nearly every market where the Fed has not intervened, including CDS.  Thus, the price impact of even small CDS trades and small positions can move spreads sharply; for example, a relatively small number of investors continuing to take short positions in financial CDS may be responsible for the bulk of the price action in recent week s.  Finally, and perhaps most importantly, investors are very concerned about whethe r the “strings” attached to government assistance for financial institutions or mark ets will be changed in the future.  In particular, the risk that the “rules of th e game” for debt investors will be changed—March 17–18, 20095 of 266after investments have been made—has rise n sharply in recent weeks.  To quote a member of our Treasury Market Practices  Group, “the rules coming from Washington change every other day; no one is willing to invest in anything.”  It’s worth noting that this risk extends beyond investments in  banks and is a reason that some investors are not planning to use the TALF, no ma tter how attractive the economics of the program may be. In response to continued deterioration in both economic and financial conditions, central banks around the world have eased  monetary policy conditions to an unprecedented degree in recent weeks.  Of the G-20 central banks, eighteen have eased monetary policy since the beginning of  the year.  In addition, exhibit 6 shows that most of the major central banks have lowered interest rates to near zero and embarked on programs to expand their bala nce sheets through a dditional liquidity programs as well as credit-easing and quant itative-easing programs.  Credit-easing programs have generally focused on purchases of commercial paper and corporate bonds outside of the U.S. In the U.S., the investment-grade cor porate bond market is the rare credit market that is operating fairly normally, but this is not the case in many countries. The local market responses to these new programs—some of which I will discuss in a moment—have generally been positive,  but their relative impact globally is harder to discern. In particular, moveme nts in major dollar FX rates (exhibit 7) do not appear to be closely rela ted to changes in policy stan ce, the degree of central bank balance sheet expansion, or relative econom ic prospects.  For example, one might expect the euro, or at least the Canadian dollar, to have appreciated relative to the U.S. dollar since the beginning of the year, given the euro area’s higher policy rates and the Canadian economy’s re lative stability.  But, in fact, the dollar has appreciated against nearly every major currency since the beginning of the year.  Certainly, the dollar’s position as a reserve currency and its continued stat us as a safe haven have contributed to its appreciation. Last week’s intervention by the Swiss Na tional Bank to weaken the Swiss franc relative to the euro (exhibit 8) is one re flection of concern over the deflationary impact of an appreciating currency.  The SNB’s intervention last Thursday pushed the Swiss franc down nearly 3½ pe rcent relative to the euro in a matter of minutes.  While the SNB does not plan to engage in ongoing competitive devaluations, preventing a sharp appreciation of the curren cy, particularly vis- à-vis the euro, is a key component in its quantitative-e asing plan to prevent deflation. However, the United Kingdom probably wins the prize for the most aggressive quantitative-easing plan, at le ast in terms of its timetable.  Two weeks ago, the Bank of England announced an asset-purchase program focused on commercial paper, corporate bonds, and government securities.  Given the limited size of U.K. credit markets, the BOE announced that the major ity of the purchases will be of government bonds, and specifically over the next three m onths they will purchase as much as £75 billion of gilts in the 5- to 25-year maturity range.March 17–18, 20096 of 266The planned BOE gilt purchases amount to 5 percent of U.K. GDP, nearly 12 percent of total gilts, and 18 percent of nominal gilts held by the public.  To put this in some perspective, a similar-siz ed program in the United States, by these metrics, would entail purchases of U.S. Treasuries ranging from $585 billion up to nearly $750 billion over a three-month period.   Since the announcement, gilt yields have  fallen 19, 53, and 79 basis points in the 5-, 10-, and 20-year maturities, respectivel y, but 2-year yields have risen 38 basis points—they are not buying 2-year gilts.  As shown in exhibit 9, most of this was an announcement effect.  Interestingly, the sp read between the policy rate and the 10-year yield in the U.K. (exhibit 10) did not decline.  In other words, long-term yields have fallen in parallel with the polic y rate.  Finally, privat e credit yields did decline with the policy ac tion, particularly corporat e bonds, which the Bank of England will also purchase. However, as noted in exhibit 11, other yields, notably swaps, fell significantly less th an government yields, leading to an increase in swap spreads. Turning now to our own asset-purchase pr ograms, we have continued to purchase both agency MBS and debt at a steady pace.   Agency debt purchases now amount to nearly $47 billion and MBS outright purch ases total $219 billion, as well as an additional $69 billion in dolla r rolls, which I will discu ss in a moment.  Exhibit 12 shows that the spreads of both agency debt and MBS to Treasury yields have been fairly stable since the last FOMC me eting.  Notably, however, the conforming mortgage rate to households has continued to decline to about 5⅛ percent. There are several reasons for this, in cluding the introduction of our dollar roll program in early March.  In the first week of March, th ere was a nearly 100 basis point drop in the forward financing rate for MBS relative to the MBS cash repo rate (exhibit 13).  You may recall that the dollar roll market is like a “repo” market for forward delivery of agency MBS. To give an example, the March–April dollar roll transaction, which is what we’re purchasing now, is a transaction that simultaneously purchases MBS for delivery in March and se lls identical MBS to be delivered in April. By participating in the dollar ro ll market, we have lowered the cost of managing mortgage inventory and moved forward financing spreads back to levels that prevailed before last fall’s turmoil. In addition, as the refina ncing wave from January abates, mortgage lenders’ ability to process new mortgages has increase d, and they have tended to lower rates to borrowers. Finally, retail spreads, while high, have come down because of the improved liquidity and predictability of cond itions in the secondary mortgage market.  Since our purchase program began in Januar y, other investors and arbitrageurs have “followed” us into the MBS market.  Not only are bid-asked spreads lower, but, as shown in exhibit 14, the daily price volat ility of new MBS has declined steadily, reducing uncertainty about prices at which new mortgages can be sold."
121,20090429,"April 28–29, 20094 of 201since early March—but much of the narrowi ng has occurred outside the U.S. banking sector. Concern about the nature of govern ment intervention in the banking industry has prevented a significant narrowing in spr eads, despite stronger equity prices.  A comparison of exhibits 2 and 3 makes this clear.  Despite rising stock prices and declining volatility, most U.S. bank CDS sp reads have widened in the last month and a half. In contrast, European  banks, whose equity price performance is similar to that of U.S. banks, have had a narrowing of CDS spreads. Setting the CAP and the political envir onment aside for the moment, exhibit 4 shows that banks’ first-quarter performance surprised to the upside, with most large global banks beating the Q1 earnings expectations, in some cases by wide margins.  That said, however, the quality and the su stainability of these earnings have been questioned, and the uncertainty about ba nks’ ability to absorb future losses— particularly related to consumers, levera ged loans, and commercial real estate— remains high.  As you can see in the last co lumn, regulatory capital ratios for most large U.S. banks exceed requirements, but th eir ratios of common equity to capital (in the third column) remain quite low.  Tangible common equity relative to assets has become the de facto measure of bank health for most market part icipants, for a couple of reasons. First, losses have to be covered by revenue and common equity, and given market uncertainty about  the future size of bank losse s, more common equity is viewed as a sign of health regardless of other types of  capital.  Second, the public policy focus on potential needs for additional common equity (directly or through convertible preferred equity) has increased the market’s focus on that measure.  It is particularly interesting to note that European  banks, in the bottom half of the table, have significantly lower tangible common equ ity ratios (and regulatory ratios) than U.S. firms.  Moreover, most analysts beli eve that European banks are not as far along in writing down their assets as their U.S.  counterparts, and they have proportionally more recession-related losses ahead of them .  Nonetheless, European bank equity performance has been about the same as that for U.S. banks; and as I noted earlier, European bank credit spreads have narrowed, whereas those of U.S. banks have widened. Another measure of the near-term uncertainty  regarding U.S. banks can be seen in the term structure of bank CDS spreads in exhibit 5.  Normally CDS term structures slope up slightly. However, currently ba nks’ CDS spreads are inverted, suggesting that if banks can survive the next two years, then the pr obability that senior debt holders will face losses is significantly diminished. Despite the hand-wringing over the near-t erm future of the banks, liquidity conditions in many markets have improved.  In particular, some of the unexploited profit opportunities that we have noted in th e past are now actually being exploited.  For example, in exhibit 6, the spread between three-month fu nding in the foreign exchange swap market relative to LIBOR has narrowed to pre-crisis levels.  This reflects better liquidity and trading conditi ons as well as a willingness of banks and others to take some additional risk onto their balance sheets.  Similarly, exhibit 7 shows a decline in the average absolute  difference between actual and modeledApril 28–29, 20095 of 201Treasury yields, reflecting an increased willingness by market participants—banks, dealers, hedge funds, and so forth—to comm it balance sheets and to arbitrage away the price differences in the Treasury market. At the bottom of the page, exhibit 8 shows jumbo and conforming 30-year mortgage rates. Not only have both mort gage rates come down, but the spread between them (in orange) has actually na rrowed since the last FOMC meeting.  You might well be surprised at this.  After all,  the secondary market for securitizing jumbo mortgages remains closed, and the Fed purchase program is focused solely on conforming mortgages.  So one might expect  that, whatever effect the Fed’s program has had in lowering conforming rates, this pr ogress could well be to the detriment of the jumbo market.  But that is not what ha s happened.  Jumbo rates appear to have fallen about 50 basis points in response to the decline in Treasur y yields after the March FOMC meeting and notably have re mained at those levels since then. I have already highlighted one market  response to our Treasury purchase program; let me turn there next.  As you can  see in exhibit 9, th e FOMC’s program to purchase $300 billion in long-term Treas uries by September had an immediate announcement impact on long-term Treasury yiel ds.  But since then, long yields have drifted higher and are now just 10 to 15 basis points below the pre-March FOMC levels. Of course, it’s hard to know the counterfactual here.  Gi ven the large quantity of new Treasury issuance and less dismal m acro news, Treasury yields might be well above their mid-March levels in the absence of Fed purchases.  We are more encouraged by the effect of the purchas e program on volatility and liquidity.  Exhibit 10 shows that implied volatility in  both Treasury and swaps markets fell sharply on the announcement and have remained  low.  Actual volatility has fallen as well. Market participants tell us that , although our purchases may not prevent long­term Treasury yields from rising, they expect  that such increases will be more orderly because of our regular presence in the market.  Market participants are already discussing (and pricing) what  may happen when the Treasury purchase program ends.  At present, most expect that the Treasu ry purchase program will be expanded and extended beyond September. However, the risk that the program may expire in September is reflected in options prices.  Implied volatility over the next six months has fallen, but volatility over the subsequent  six months has been rising in recent weeks. The Desk is focusing its purchas es in the 2-to-10-year segment of the Treasury curve, consistent w ith the FOMC’s directive to help improve conditions in private credit markets.  As you can see from exhibit 11, we are making smaller purchases outside this target range—to the disappointment of some market participants—but will continue to concentrate most of the $300 billion in purchases between two and ten years. Somewhat to our surprise, we are purchasing a sizable amount of on-the-run Treasuries.  Because of the very large amount of new Treasury supply and the continued pressure on dealer s to keep their balance sheets small, on­the-runs are being offered to us in large si zes and at quite competitive prices relative to the market.  One last note about the Tr easury market:  This Friday a new market standard of charging for failures to deliver in the Treasury market will go into effect.  While we wholeheartedly believe that this will improve Treasury market liquidityApril 28–29, 20096 of 201when interest rates are low by reducing the incentives to deliberately fail, there may be some anomalous Treasury movements in upcoming weeks as market participants adjust to the new standard. Turning to the mortgage-backed-securit ies purchase program , exhibit 12 shows the daily pattern of our agency MBS purch ases, including the step-up in average size after the March FOMC meeting.  Our purchas es have been a little smoother in recent weeks largely because volatility is lowe r.  Early on we bought more on days when MBS prices were low and less on days when  prices were high.  As volatility has declined, there are fewer of those days.  In addition, because volatility is lower, originators are selling more forward and at  a steady pace, which is reflected in our purchases. We are purchasing TBAs (the  forward MBS) at about $135 billion per month, although we anticipate that delivery w ill be lumpy and that June deliveries of MBS, in particular, may be very large.  Exhibit 13 shows a limited announcement effect on agency MBS and mortgage rate s after the March FOMC.  Since then, however, primary rates have drifted lower,  and secondary MBS yields have been stable, despite the rise in Treasury yiel ds.  Given the size of our MBS purchase program, we are not surprised at our ab ility to influence secondary-market MBS yields, but we have a more limited ability to influence primary mortgage rates.  The good news is that the primary–secondary mort gage spread has not widened with the recent large refinancing wave (unlike earlier this year), bu t overall the spread remains quite wide by historical standards. The spread is affected by a number of other factors, including fees charged by the GSEs; the costs of hedging mortgage inventories, servicing spreads, and valuations; and the pricing power and capacity constraints of the originators. Unfortunatel y, our purchases can help to influence only some of these factors—specifically, hedging and pipeline costs—and the Administration’s housing program can help to  lower GSE costs and servicer costs, but the other factors (in part icular, pricing power and capac ity constraints) may, in the future, work to push spreads higher. E xhibit 14 makes clear why our ability to influence MBS yields is larger than our ability to move Treasury yields.  Our MBS purchase program—both to date and as pl anned through the end of 2009—represents a sizable portion of expected new MBS suppl y this year.  In contrast, our announced Treasury purchases amount to less than a th ird of expected issuance over the life of the program. Although the TALF subscrip tion in April was even smaller than we had anticipated, we are somewhat encouraged by the price response and the fact that non-TALF securitizations have come to market as well.  Exhibit 15 shows that secondary-market spreads on triple-A-rated ABS c ontinued to narrow after both TALF subscriptions. Moreover, the yields on new securitizations have been at least 100 basis points tighter (and in some cases, as much as 700 basis points tighter) than the spreads in exhibit 15. Much of this  drop in yield is du e to better liquidity conditions and the fact that TALF subscrip tions have provided the market with some price transparency for the first time in months.  As shown in exhibit 16, better liquidity and pricing have encouraged non-TA LF securitizations as well—particularly in auto loans and credit cards,  where activity had effectivel y ground to a halt last fall."
122,20090603,"June 3, 20094 of 20fall, and the banks’ capital-raising efforts si nce the release of the stress test results have exceeded expectations.  Gains in bot h equity and commodity prices reflect a growing belief that global economic growth has stabilized, if not exactly turned the corner. In short, the perceived tail risk of a sustai ned free-fall in the economy, combined with another financial meltdown, has receded fairly significantly.  The improvement in risky asset markets has been accompanied by significant increases in government bond yields and steep er yield curves around the globe.  This, of course, includes Treasuries and has some implicati ons for our purchase programs.  Similarly, the notable improvement in funding conditions  is reflected in reduced use of Fed liquidity facilities—and th at’s a good thing—but it aff ects our bala nce sheet. I will talk about our programs and our bala nce sheet in a few moments, but let me start first with what is mostly good news .  Since the April FOMC meeting, global equity markets are up 10 to 30 percent, led by particularly strong increases in emerging markets and stock prices of all t ypes of financial firms.  The improvement in the global growth outlook and the portfolio  reallocation toward riskier assets is reflected in the narrowing of credit spr eads nearly everywhere—with the largest declines in spreads occurring in the riskiest  asset classes and the riskiest countries.  Not surprisingly, the dollar has weakened notably, but in an orderly way.  It’s fallen about 8 percent on a trade-wei ghted basis since the April FOMC meeting.  Generally speaking, the dollar de preciation has been largest ag ainst currencies where equity performance has been the strongest and th e credit-spread tightening has been the largest.  The one exception to this, which is  a bit of a puzzle, is  the euro, where the dollar is nearly 9 percent weaker since late April. Turning to the United States, corporate credit spreads have tightened nearly 125 basis points for investment-grade co mpanies and 350 basis points for high-yield companies since late April.  In fact, co rporate bond rates themselves have actually fallen despite the backup in Treasury yields .  The largest banks continue to raise capital and issue non-FDIC guaranteed debt at  a fairly fast pace, and the ease with which this capital has been raised is notable.  Several of th e issues have been significantly oversubscribed, and the relatively muted effect of what in many cases is very significant dilution re flects both better economic news and increased confidence in the long-term viability of the large banks. Similarly, the spreads on most securitized products continue to narrow.  Yesterday’s TALF subscription supported $15½ billion of asset- backed securities, $11½ billion of which was financed in the TALF.  That’s 13 issues, and they covered nearly all the eligible asset classes.  Indi catives, which are quoted  spreads on existing consumer ABS, have continued to tighten, and the spreads on actual transactions have narrowed more than anticipated. Compared with the May TALF, the June subscription spreads are anywhere from 15 to  30 basis points narrower.  For a little longer term comparison, a Ford auto loan securitization yesterda y priced 130 basis points lower than a very similar issue in the inaugural March subscription of the TALF. Thinking ahead to exit—and this may be too soon—but there were several non-TALF credit card securitizati ons in the last week or two that were sold at spreadsJune 3, 20095 of 20at or below 100 basis points. In other words, they were sold at prices that make their financing uneconomical in the TALF.  The notable exception to this trend is the commercial-mortgage-backed securities mark et, where spreads widened very sharply last week in response to a proposed cha nge in ratings methodology by Standard & Poor’s. S&P’s changes, if implemented, coul d result in downgrades of nearly half of the most senior CMBS tranches eligible  for legacy TALF.  (It would also place S&P’s ratings judgments very far from its peers.)  Prior to the S&P announcement, the CMBS spreads had narrowed steadily in re sponse to the expansion of the TALF to new and then to legacy CMBS; but since the announcement, they have widened more than 100 basis points. All the factors I noted at th e last briefing have continue d to push Treasury yields higher. Less macro tail risk, an unwindi ng of last winter’s “flight to quality” investments, upward revisions  to both current and futu re Treasury supply, and the U.S. Treasury’s intentional shift of issuan ce out the yield curve have all contributed to an increase of nearly 65 basis points in  the spread between two-year and ten-year Treasuries in recent weeks.  It’s worth no ting that the 2-year yield hasn’t budged—all of the steepening is due to an increase in  the 10-year yield.  The yield curve is exceptionally steep, even by the standards of  past recessions.  Typically, the spread between the two-year and th e ten-year yield steepens steadily throughout recessions and continues to steepen into the recover y.  The current spread is 270 basis points— that is above the post-recession peaks in th e last few recessions and certainly much higher than previous levels la te in recessionary periods in the past.  In addition to the factors I’ve noted, a minority of market partic ipants have interpreted this steepness as evidence of significantly increased inflation ri sk, but that doesn’t seem to us at the Desk to be the consensus view in markets.   Reduced risk of deflation and improved liquidity in the TIPS market are the most co mmonly cited explanations for the rise in long-dated breakeven rates. I’ll repeat myself one more time by noting that the Treasury purchase program is not large enough to offset the factors that are increasing long-term yields.  We continue to purchase securities at a steady pace, with purchases concentrated in the 2-year to 10-year matur ity range.  You won’t be surprised that our operations continue to be met with very strong offers to sell securities to us. Turning finally to mortgage markets, until the middle of last week, the effect of both the MBS and the agency purchase programs had been to narrow spreads to more-normal levels in these markets and, in the case of MBS, to encourage the refinancing wave that began in March. Howe ver, there is a clear limit to how low the Desk could and should push MBS and agency yi elds relative to rising Treasury rates.  We don’t wish to push spreads so low that we “become the market.”  This would not only be detrimental to market functioning but  would also likely impair our ability to exit successfully when the time comes.  In the MBS market, we reached that limit last Tuesday, when the MBS–Treasury spread was 130 basis points, about 10 basis points below where it had been at the time of the April FOMC meeting.  On Wednesday of last week, MBS yields jumped over 40 basi s points, and the 10-year Treasury yield rose 20 basis points, with most of those in creases occurring in just a couple of hours during the afternoon. The proximate cause of the jump in yields was convexityJune 3, 20096 of 20hedging by mortgage servicers and originator s as the primary mortgage rate rose above 5 percent—the level widely viewed  as the “trigger” for households to refinance, or not refinance. But more fundamentally, the backup in MBS yields and mortgage rates was, frankly, inevitable gi ven the steady rise in Treasury yields. As is typical in the MBS market, on ce mortgage rates rose far enough that refinancing became unattractive, mortgage ex tension risk caused a positive feedback loop to ensue. With slower expected refi nancings, the duration of existing mortgages and their associated servicing rights in creased, which prompted selling of long-duration assets (MBS, swaps, and Treasurie s), which in turn pushed long-term rates even higher, which caused more duration extension, more sel ling, and even higher long-term rates.  You get the picture. By  the end of Wednesday, it was clear that the spring refinancing wave that we had been  experiencing was over.  The mortgage convexity vortex—that’s one of my favorite  descriptive terms of  this—has waxed and waned over the past week. There were la rge increases in rate s on Wednesday and on Monday and modest declines in rates on othe r days.  Regardless of the daily pattern, there is no doubt that mortgage rates have moved to a highe r level, and there is likely to be additional volatility in fixed-income markets in the near term. So what does this mean for the MBS purchase program?  Except for a single day last week, we have not significantly increased our pace of purchases, nor are we planning to. To do so, we believe, woul d only narrow MBS–Treasury spreads to the point that other investors would leave th e market.  Moreover, the supply of low-coupon MBS is likely to slow significantly in coming weeks, and so over time we will shift the composition of our purch ases toward higher-coupon, more-seasoned mortgages. If the rise in long-term rates persists—which it may if  there continue to be macro improvements, large Treasury supply, and convexity hedging—then the new supply of MBS is likely to fall to very low levels, at which point we will consider additional tactical changes to th e MBS program.  We are already considering several ways to adjust both the MBS and th e agency-debt purchase programs in such circumstances, and we will be reporti ng back to you with our findings and recommendations at the next meeting. Finally, as Brian and I noted in the memo  last week, the ba lance sheet has not grown as quickly as we had forecasted just a few weeks ago.  Essentially, the improvement in private funding markets—ev idenced by a 40 basis point decline in the three-month LIBOR rate—has accelerated th e shrinkage in our liquidity facilities.  As of the end of May, the liquidity faci lities were $255 billi on smaller than we expected a few weeks ago—mainly because of very large declines in participation in the TAF, swap-financed foreign dollar operations, and the CPFF.  Figures from this week’s operations suggest that the use of our liquidity faciliti es will continue to shrink, although perhaps not quite as rapidly as in the last fe w weeks.  As a result, our near-term projections for the balance sheet and the monetary base have been revised down. We now expect the ba lance sheet to grow about 3 percent per month over the summer. We will provide more details on balance sheet projections in a couple of weeks. In the meantime, I’m happy to take any questions."
123,20090624,"1 The materials used by Mr. Sack are appended to this transcript (appendix 1).       June 23–24, 20094 of 261Transcript of the Federal Open  Market Committee Meeting on June 23-24, 2009 June 23, 2009—Afternoon Session CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Good afternoon, ever ybody.  This is a joint meeting of the FOMC and the Board, as has been our custom in  the past, so I need a motion to close the meeting. MR. KOHN. So moved. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Let me fi rst welcome Brian Sack officially in his role as manager of the System Open Ma rket Account.  We look forward to a long and productive association. I also want to mention that I know there’s a great deal of in terest in the Administration’s financial regulatory reform plan and its implicat ions for the Federal Reserve.  Tomorrow at lunch after the meeting, I will update you on what I kn ow about it, and then we can have some discussion if you’d like. We have a substantial number of presen tations today.  The staff has made an extraordinary effort to provide us with a grea t deal of background information on the balance sheet, reserve management, exit strategy, and impor tant related issues.  If the Committee is willing, I’d like to go straight through the first se t of presentations with clarifying questions only and then have as much Q&A as the Committee would like and then a general discussion.  If that’s all right, then let’s begin with Brian Sack to report on market developments. MR. SACK.1  Financial markets improved furt her over the period since the last FOMC meeting, with risky asset prices risi ng on net, financial in stitutions raising new capital, and money markets co ntinuing to heal.  Those de velopments reflect, and in turn support, greater optimism about the economic outlook.  However, oneJune 23–24, 20095 of 261consequence of these events was that interm ediate- and long-term interest rates came under significant upward pressure. As can be seen in chart 1, Treasury coupon yields moved up markedly over the intermeeting period, with increases of 20 to 80 basis points.  The run-up was initially concentrated in longer-term yields, but more recently it spilled over into the two-year yield as well. The rise in the two-year yield was driven in  part by a shift in monetary policy expectations, as the “green shoots” theme continued to gain traction.  As shown in chart 2, expectations of monetary policy tightening this year remain limited, but the market now anticipates nearly 200 basis points of tightening over 2010. The upward movement in Treasury yields wa s the largest, howe ver, at horizons beyond the next year or two, as can be seen in the shift in the yield curve in chart 3.  The upward pressure on longer-term Treasury yields came from a variety of sources, including an improved economic outlook, an associated reduction in the risk of deflation, substantial increases in the s upply of Treasury debt, the need to hedge mortgage convexity exposure as rates incr eased, and an ongoing reve rsal of the flight­to-quality flows.  Our survey of primary de alers indicated that many of these factors were seen as “important,” as summarized in  chart 4.  An increase in upside inflation risk was also cited as a relevant, but less important, factor.  The upward pressure on yields occurred de spite the fact that the Federal Reserve continued to take considerable amount s of duration onto its own books through the large-scale asset purchase programs.  As shown in chart 5, the SOMA continued to accumulate longer-term assets through the th ree programs initiated by the FOMC.  As the chart indicates, those purchases have proceeded at a relatively steady pace towards their mandated sizes.  As summarized  to the right in chart 6, the Desk has purchased $170 billion of Treas ury securities to date, $90 bil lion of agency securities, and $577 billion of MBS. Our dealer survey  indicated that market participants are not expecting much expansion of the pr ograms beyond the currently stated limits.  The median survey response indicated no exp ected increase in the size of the agency and MBS programs and only a 15 percent ch ance of expansion of the Treasury program at this meeting, with the peak amount of Treasury purchases put at $363 billion. Given their current sizes, these progra ms have had different degrees of importance in their respective markets.  For Treasury securities, the SOMA purchases have simply been overwhelmed by new issuance.  As shown in ch art 7, the supply of new Treasury debt is far outpacing the accu mulation by SOMA, leaving the market to digest considerable amounts of new debt and putting upward pressure on yields.  That is not the case for MBS, however, where the Fed’s purchases to date have been large relative to the size of  the market and the flow of new supply. This pattern may explain why the MBS purch ases have had such a notable effect on the MBS rate. As shown in chart 8, the MBS current coupon rate fell sharply after the program was announced, both because th e Treasury yield declined and becauseJune 23–24, 20096 of 261the spread to Treasuries na rrowed.  That movement prompted a major refinancing wave, with nearly the entire universe of  outstanding fixed-rate mortgage loans becoming refinanceable.  The MBS rate subseq uently remained near 4 percent, even as the Treasury yield began to move up, in part because of a perception that SOMA purchases would be used to hold the line at that level.  Mo re recently, though, the MBS rate began to rise, with two important factors amplifying that movement.  First, the rise in yields reduced repayment ri sk, extending the duration of outstanding mortgages and causing mortgage holders a nd servicers to try to shed duration elsewhere—the convexity hedging mentioned above.  Second, mark et participants came to understand that the Fed would not ramp up the pace of its MBS purchases significantly in reaction to upward pressure on the MBS rate, in contrast to the expectations of many.  On bala nce, the MBS rate is 80 basis points higher than at the time of the last FOMC meeting.  Much of that change has showed through to the primary mortgage rate, which has increased about 60 basis points. Overall, our view is that the purchase programs have kept Treasury yields and mortgage rates lower than they otherwise would have been, though they are no longer at the very low levels that were obser ved ahead of the last FOMC meeting. The move towards higher yields has been accompanied by considerable chatter in the market about inflation risks.  As s hown in chart 9, break-even inflation rates moved up notably with the backup in nominal yields, with the five-year, five-year forward measure (the Barclays measure) ap proaching 2.5 percent.  However, some of the rise in recent months appears to reflect  that the risk of low inflation has been pared and that the liquidity of TIPS has improved.  Break-even inflation rates have not reached levels that would suggest that either inflation expect ations or perceived upside inflation risks were unusually high. That interpretation is  largely confirmed by the distribution of longer-term inflation out comes from our dealer  survey, chart 10.  The chart shows the evolution of the distribution over the la st three FOMC meetings.  In general, respondents have been shaving down the left tail, with most of the mass making its way into the 2 percent to 2.5 percen t bucket rather than into the upper tail.  Still, it is important to note that the in flation outlook is now seen as much more balanced, as reflected in bot h the survey and the level of  break-even inflation rates. I will close my discussion of yields by taking a longer-term perspective.  Although it seems that many factors are puttin g upward pressure on Treasury yields, the yield curve is essentially showing the same degree of steepness that has occurred around or just after the end of previous reces sions, as can be seen in chart 11.  Thus, despite the unprecedented fiscal deficits and the unprecedented expansion of reserves, the yield curve is not doing anything unprecedented.  Of course, one potential explanation is that the la rge-scale asset purchase programs have prevented a more severe steepening. The greater prospects for an economic recovery are also reflected in a broad set of risky asset prices. Corporate yield spread s, chart 12, came down significantly, with the investment-grade and high-yield sp reads narrowing by 176 and 405 basis points,"
124,20090812,"August 11–12, 20094 of 165positive earnings surprises in the quarter—a bout the highest percentage observed over the past fifteen years.  At the same ti me, investors continued to become more optimistic about economic prospects.  The re sponses to our dealer survey indicated that market participants raised their for ecasts for second-half growth and saw fewer downside risks to those forecasts. Given the news on earnings and the econom y, investors’ perceptions of risk declined further, as indicated by the drop in the implied volatility of equity prices, the middle left panel.  Corresponding with th at shift, investor s showed a greater willingness to hold risky assets.  Retail invest ors, for example, have been reallocating large amounts of capital out of the safest asset classes, su ch as money market mutual funds, as shown in the middle right panel.  That capital appears to be making its way into a range of riskier asset classes, in cluding equity and fixed-income funds both here and abroad. Given this shift in risk appetite, corporate bond spreads continued to narrow sharply, as shown in the bottom left panel, with the spread on the investment-grade index declining about 75 basis points and that on the high-yield index declining nearly 250 basis points since the last meeti ng.  Other risky asset classes, such as emerging-market debt and stoc ks, have also benefited. The panel to the right suggest s that the dollar has also been strongly influenced by shifts in investor risk appetite. In pa rticular, there has been  a tight relationship between the dollar and risky asset prices, he re captured by an emerging-market equity index, with the dollar appreciating last fall as investors attempted to move into safe assets and depreciating more recently as risk appetite returned.  On net, the dollar has fallen 1 percent to 2 percent on a broad, trade-weighted basis over the intermeeting period. The increased optimism about the economi c outlook has coincided with favorable developments in the financial sector.  Share prices of large financial institutions rose substantially, as shown in the top left panel of exhi bit 2, in response to robust earnings reports. Those earnings were fueled by strong profits in trading and investment banking activity.  The durability of those sources of revenue is questionable, but that did not  seem to trouble investors. Earnings results for smaller and regional financial institutions were not as strong.  Those institutions benefited little from the robust tradi ng gains that helped large firms.  Moreover, some regional banks posted greater-than-e xpected loan loss provisions for consumer loans, and many of  them have considerable exposure to commercial real estate and construction loan s.  Despite those hurdles, regional banks managed to meet their earnings expectat ions on average, and their share prices performed as well as those of larger  firms over the intermeeting period. The difficulties at CIT that surfaced in mid- July highlighted the fact that financial institutions can still run into difficulties.  Nevertheless, financial markets continued toAugust 11–12, 20095 of 165function well throughout that episode. Moreover, investors’ perceptions of counterparty risk in the financial sect or improved notably over the intermeeting period. CDS spreads for major financial in stitutions moved lower, by 50 to 200 basis points in most cases, as shown in the top right.  Moreover, the spread of LIBOR over the OIS rate, the middle left, continued to shrink, with the three-month spread falling below 30 basis points. At those maturities  shown, spreads have reached levels that many thought would constitute the post-cr isis normal.  Longer-term spreads, however, still remain elevated. One hurdle that the financial sector faces  going forward is the expiration of the FDIC’s temporary liquidity guarantee progr am (or TLGP) on October 31.  The TLGP has allowed financial institutions to issue de bt at a much lower cost than they would have otherwise paid, as indicated in the mi ddle right panel.  Financial firms currently have $330 billion of outstanding debt under the program, with maturities out to three years. As that debt matures and has to be rolled over into new securities, these firms will likely face higher financing costs.  However, given that the maturity of that debt is spread out and that firms have been making efforts to reduce their reliance on the program, market participants do not currently anticipate any problems around its termination. This argument raises a broader point to be considered.  While money markets and financial markets more broadly have healed  to a great degree, the improvement has been conditioned on a number of governme nt support programs—many of which are scheduled to expire over th e next six months.  Over the period between now and February 1, in chronological order, the ma rkets will need to digest the end of the Treasury’s money market guarantee program , the FDIC’s TLGP, the Fed’s large-scale asset-purchase (LSAP) program in Treasuries, the Fed’s MMIFF, the Treasury’s purchases of agency MBS, the Fed’s LSAP  programs in agency debt and MBS, the Treasury’s credit facility for the GSEs (or GSECF), the Fed’s CPFF, AMLF, PDCF, and TSLF, and potentially the Treasury’s TARP authority.  The good news is that we will all benefit from some much-needed acr onym relief; [laughter] the bad news is that there are many risks involved.  The e xpiration of any one of these programs individually seems manageable, but it is more challenging to judge the effects of removing them all together.  That is one r eason that we want to continue to monitor markets closely with this in mind. As shown in the bottom panels, securiti zed credit markets also improved over the intermeeting period.  Here the story very  directly involves the effects from government programs aimed at supporting thos e markets.  The consumer ABS market has made considerable strides in the right direction.  ABS spreads narrowed further, as shown to the left, and new issuance  continued at a decent clip.  These developments have been driven import antly by the ongoing support from the TALF facility. The July and August TALF subscriptions for ABS involved about $21 billion of TALF-eligible issuance, of which about $12 billion was financed through the facility. Improveme nts in the CMBS market ha ve generally been slower, but the market has reacted favorably to r ecent news about the inclusion of CMBS inAugust 11–12, 20096 of 165the TALF program and in the Treasury’s  PPIP program.  As shown to the right, CMBS spreads have narrowed significantly since the last FOMC meeting.  However, spreads are still very wide by historical  standards, and there has been no new issuance. With commercial real estate  prices falling, de linquencies rising, and considerable amounts of CMBS coming due thro ugh 2012, this sector is likely to face considerable pressure for some time. As shown in the next exhibit, the positive sentiment reflected in recent asset-price movements put upward pressure on Treasury yields.  However, the changes were fairly modest, with coupon yields moving up 5 to 15 basis points, on net, over the intermeeting period.  The market’s expect ations for monetary policy steepened a touch, as reflected in the rates on federa l funds and Eurodollar futures contracts, shown to the right. Our dealer survey helps to shed some mo re light on these policy expectations.  The middle panels show the distribution of outcomes for the federal funds rate that are perceived by the respondents for horizons  of 12 months ahead (to the left) and 18 months ahead (to the right).  As can be seen, the modal forecast is for the federal funds rate to remain unchanged at the 0 to 25 basis point range, even at that longer horizon. However, one feature of being at the zero bound is that th e risks tend to be skewed in only one direction. The dist ributions show that respondents see some probability of higher rates, with that probability building as the horizon extends through 2010. This skewed risk profile ha s presumably pulled the futures rates up relative to what is perceived to be the most likely outcome.  Overall, investors apparently expect that the recovery will be anemic enough to allow the Fed to keep policy rates low well into 2010—a view  that has been supported by FOMC communications. Even though it is seen as s till being a way off, market participants also focused on whether the Fed will face any difficulties  exiting from its accommodative policy stance. Investors reportedl y took some comfort from Chairman Bernanke’s op-ed piece in the Wall Street Journal  and his monetary policy testimony on July 21.  This subject was also addressed by several ot her FOMC members over the intermeeting period, with market participants taking note of the consistency of the message.  The discussion of exit is presumably aimed, in  part, at keeping longer-term inflation expectations anchored. As shown in the bot tom left panel, measures of the five-year five-year-forward breakeven inflation rate rose over the intermeeting period and are near the upper end of the range  seen over the past several ye ars.  Our interpretation of the level of the breakeven rate  is the same as it was at the last meeting—that it has moved up to levels that, while not alarming, show more balance in  the perceived risks around the inflation outlook. As shown to the right, our dealer su rvey indicates that the perceived likelihood of  CPI inflation from five to te n years ahead is the highest in the buckets from 1.5 percent to 2.5 percent—le vels that are consis tent with the long­term inflation projections of most FOMC members."
125,20090923,"1 The materials used by Mr. Sack are appended to this transcript (appendix 1). September 22–23, 20094 of 212MR. SACK.1  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Prices on a broad range of risky assets continued to rise over th e intermeeting period, fueled by an improving economic outlook and the low level of financing rate s arising from the current stance of monetary policy. Broad equity indexes, shown in the upper left panel, rose more than 7 percent on balance, adding to  the sizable recovery since the end of the first quarter.  Corporate bond spreads, the upper right, edged down further, leaving them dramatically improved from their levels earlier in the year. The gains over the past six months owe primarily to a more optimistic assessment of the economic outlook and a perception th at the downside risk s to growth have diminished.  Indeed, as captur ed in our primary dealer survey in the middle left panel, the upward revision in the expected path of GDP growth from earl ier in the year has been substantial. In addition, respondents also indicat ed that the downside risks around the expected growth path diminished notably over this period.  This shift has reduced the amount of uncertainty  that investors see in ris ky asset prices, as indicated by the relatively low levels of implied vol atility on equities, shown to the right. The gains in asset prices have been so dramatic that market observers have begun to wonder whether the markets have become too frothy, with some pointing to the extensive liquidity provided by the Federal Reserve as a contributing factor.  By many metrics, however, asset valuations do not look too extended.  The Board staff’s measure of the equity premium, shown in  the bottom left panel, is still high by historical standards. Likewise, by many m easures, corporate yiel d spreads still look relatively high, taking into account the outlook for defaults.  As shown in the bottom  right, expected corporate defaults have fa llen substantially since earlier in the year, which likely explains a considerable por tion of the narrowing of corporate yield spreads. Overall, risky asset prices have come a long way over the past six months, but so has the economic environment that they reflect. In contrast to the more accommodative c onditions in financial markets, banks continued to restrict credit to private borrowers.  As shown in the upper left panel of exhibit 2, the volume of privat e loans at commercial banks (the dark blue line) has declined sharply. This decline has not been  driven by a lack of  available funds, as deposits (the orange line) have risen sharply and other sources of funding have become more readily available.  In fact, banks have been accumulating Treasury and agency securities (the light  blue line) over this period. However, they have less appetite for adding credit risk  to their portfolios, as they  continue to repair their balance sheets and face additional loan write-downs going forward. Part of the decline in bank credit al so reflects weaker demand.  The business sector as a whole has little need to rais e new funds, and net borrowing by the sector has been negative in recent months.  In a ddition, firms with access to the market have shifted towards corporate bonds as a source of financing.  This shift can be seen in theSeptember 22–23, 20095 of 212amount of high-yield debt that has been issu ed since the first quar ter, the upper right panel. The pattern for consumer credit is similar in some regards.  Overall, consumer credit is contracting sharply, despite th e issuance of a decent volume of consumer-related ABS. As shown in the middle left panel, ABS issuance re ached $38 billion in the third quarter, near its pace from the previous quarter. Activity in the ABS market has been s upported to a great extent by the TALF, with nearly all of the ABS deals in the th ird quarter brought to the market through the TALF. However, there are signs that depe ndence on the TALF is beginning to wane.  Most notably, even though most issuance is TALF-elig ible, the amount of that issuance that is actually financed through the facility has been declining, a sign that private credit markets have improved e nough to make TALF financing relatively expensive for some borrowers.  At the September subscription, for example, only $6 billion of the nearly $17 billion of ABS issued ended up being financed through the TALF. The better financing conditions and the gr eater willingness of investors to take risk have led to a further decline in ABS spreads, shown in the middle right panel.  Spreads for AAA-rated consumer ABS have re turned to levels not seen since the middle of last year. Spreads also narrowed on outstanding CMBS, the bottom left, despite the ongoing worsening in the outlook for the commercial real estate sector.  The improvement in CMBS has been very much tied to government support programs, as the PPIP and the TALF have led market participants to antic ipate greater demand for these assets.  The nine PPIP funds are in the process of rais ing capital and should begin purchases of assets later this year, and the TALF has now included three su bscriptions covering legacy CMBS assets, financing over $4 bill ion of purchases.  In addition, a recently announced change by Treasury to the tax tr eatment of CMBS workouts seemed to provide a further boost to thei r prices.  Unfortunately, as sh own to the right, issuance of new CMBS remains completely shut down, and the TALF has yet to fund any new-issue CMBS.  Thus, the commercial real estate sector faces a very difficult credit environment going forward. Despite the broad increase in risky asse t prices, Treasury yields moved lower over the intermeeting period.  As shown in the upper left panel of exhibit 3, Treasury coupon yields declined 15 to 30 basis points, on net.  The most important sources of the decline in longer-term rates, according to our dealer surve y, were a decline in inflation expectations, a reduction in upsid e inflation risks, an d strong demand from foreign official institutions. Consistent  with those responses, forward break-even inflation rates, shown to the right, moved down over the intermeeting period.  Investors also see less inte rest rate risk, as suggest ed by the implied volatility measures shown in the middle left panel,  which have fallen notably from their elevated levels over the summer.  The perc eived reduction in upsid e inflation risk and the decline in interest rate volatility may have contributed to a narrowing of the term premium embedded in longer-term yields.September 22–23, 20096 of 212Investors also apparently marked down the expected pa th of monetary policy, as the substantial slack in the economy and other favorable inflation news supported the view that the Fed would remain on hold fo r an extended period.  As shown in the middle right panel, futures prices now suggest  a later start to policy tightening.  That brings the market pricing closer to the resu lts from our dealer survey.  As shown in the bottom left, most survey respondents do not expect the tight ening to begin until the third quarter of 2010 or later. The FOMC’s decision to taper its purcha ses of Treasury securities, announced at the last FOMC meeting, was well received by market participants.  This approach is widely seen by investors as  a prudent exit strategy, a nd the announcement did not prompt any response in Treas ury yields.  At present, the Desk has completed $289 billion of purchases, and it plans to wind down its remaining purchases over the next five weeks, as shown in the bottom right panel, while still reaching a cumulative purchase total of $300 billion. The exit from the agency debt and MB S purchase programs could prove more challenging, however. As shown in the upper left panel of the next exhibit, option-adjusted MBS spreads over Treasury yields  remain unusually tight.  In our view, Federal Reserve purchases have had a s ubstantial effect on MBS rates, partly accounting for this low level of spreads. Mark et participants seem to agree with that assessment.  As shown to the right, the res ponses to our dealer survey indicate that the purchase programs are seen as pushing down the current-coupon MBS rate by a significant amount, with an average response of  about 60 basis points.  However, it is worth noting that only a subset of responde nts chose to provide such estimates, and the responses vary over a wide range. Given these effects, some observers are concerned that the MB S rate will rise sharply as the Fed’s purchases come to an end.  The extent of these concerns should depend on one’s views about how the purchase programs affect the markets.  As we have highlighted in recent memos, the e ffect on market interest rates could come primarily through the stock of assets purchased, consistent with a portfolio balance effect. Under that perspective, even an abrupt end of the purchase program would not create market difficulties, as the stock of assets held outside the Fed would not change discretely. However, we have also highlighted the possibil ity that the flow of purchases could have some effect on rates due to various market imperfections.  In that case, one might be concerned about how the market would adjust to a sharp drop-off in asset purchases by the Fed. To gauge the scope of these different e ffects, we asked the respondents to our dealer survey about their views on how the Fed’s asset purchases affect the market.  The answers did not exactly settle the issue:   In rough terms, about one-third of the respondents said that the eff ects arise primarily through stoc k effects, one-third said primarily through flow effects, and one- third said through both.  [Laughter.] Moreover, in quantifying the effects of the purchase programs, most respondents saw"

The surge in the prices  of risky assets that has taken place since March cooled off over the inte rmeeting period, as investors took note of the economic risks that remain and the ongoi ng difficulties facing the financial sector.  As shown in the top left panel of the firs t exhibit, broad equity indexes declined modestly, on net, since the last FOMC mee ting.  That is a notable downshift from the gains posted over the previous four inte rmeeting periods, which averaged over 8 percent per period. The drop in equity prices occurred desp ite favorable earnings surprises for the third quarter. As shown in the top right pa nel, more than 80 percent of the firms in the S&P 500 index beat expectations—a n unusually high portion by historical standards. However, inve stors also focused on the growth of revenue, which was generally less impressive, and questioned the sustainability of profit growth.  Moreover, equity prices no l onger benefited from the subs tantial upward revisions to the economic outlook that had pr opelled earlier gains.  I ndeed, recent economic data have been seen as mixed, and the GDP forecasts of most market participants were essentially unchanged from the previous FO MC meeting, as indicated in the dealer survey responses in th e middle left panel. One factor weighing on st ocks was a growing con cern among investors about prospects for financial firms.  Banks’ earni ngs reports continued to highlight many of the problems facing that sector, and inve stors also became increasingly concerned about how pending regulatory changes would affect those institutions.  As a result, financial shares lost ground over the interm eeting period, as shown in the middle right panel. Nonfinancial firms continued to be seen as relatively h ealthy.  Indeed, yield spreads on corporate bonds narrowed furthe r over the intermeeting period, although at a less rapid pace than earlier in the year, as shown in the bottom left panel.  Overall, despite their sharp gains from earlier in the year, we do not see equity or corporate bond prices as stre tched well beyond fundamental values.  This can be seen in the Board’s equity premium measure,  shown to the right, which is wide by historical standards. It is also reflected  in recent work by the New York Fed staff on high-yield bonds, suggesting that those yiel d spreads are near th e levels expected given the outlook for defaults. Our assessment is that, overall, the levels of U.S. asset prices appear reasonable.   Nevertheless, this assessment  could change if the very rapid gains from earlier in the year were to continue.  In this regard, the flattening out of asset prices since the last meeting coul d be regarded as a favorable development, as it suggests that those prices ar e still connected to fundamentals. As shown in the next exhibit, Treasury yields were little changed, on balance, since the last FOMC meeting.  In part, this pattern reflects that the incoming economic news has been mixed and has not pr ovided any clear direction for yields.  Investors also took note of the considerable volume of commentary by Fed officials.  As shown in the top right panel, FOMC me mbers gave no less than 30 speeches in the month of October.  I’m all for Central Ba nk transparency, but this may be going a bitNovember 3–4, 20095 of 201far. [Laughter] Many of those speeches  were seen by the markets as containing directional information about the likely cour se of monetary policy, and investors saw some of those messages as conflicting with one another.  In part for this reason, investors marked down the grade they ga ve you on communications in our dealer survey. Despite all of the focus on these speeches, the implied policy path was little changed, on net, as shown in the middle left  panel.  Investors continue to expect policy to remain on hold until at least the middle of 2010. This accommodative policy stance is one of the factors that market participants see as contributing to the decline in the do llar from earlier this year, as shown in the middle right panel.  The degree of angst a bout the dollar seems to have been building in recent months, as its weakness ha s been widely discussed among market participants. A key policy question is wh ether the dollar movement reflects an appropriate response to the outlook for the economy and policy or whether it is the beginning of a more abrupt decline that  could ultimately produce a problematic increase in inflation or inflation expectations.  We lean toward the former explanation. The decline to date has been smooth and orderly—at a pace not much different from that seen before the fall of  2008.  In fact, over this intermeeting period, the dollar was essentially flat against our ma jor trading partners.  Moreover, some of the recent weakening reflects an unwinding of  the surge in the dollar that took place during the financial crisis. It is also worth noting that currency options markets do not seem to be pricing in considerable odds of an abrupt dollar decl ine, as indicated in the pricing of risk-reversals against the eur o, in the bottom left panel.  These do not show a premium for protection against sizable dollar depreciati on, and in fact, are now pointed in the opposite direction.  That said, we are mindful of the risks that are present, given the widespread focus of investors on this issue. Moreover, the Treasury market is pricing in a bit more inflation protection than was the case at th e last FOMC meeting.  As shown in the bottom right panel, some measures of forw ard breakeven inflation rates have turned higher of late, though they are still within hi storical ranges.  In any event, we will closely monitor these markets for any signs that a more definitive correlation between dollar weakness and inflation ex pectations is developing.  As covered in your next exhibit, the De sk completed the last of its scheduled Treasury purchase operations last week. I thought it would be useful to provide a summary of the program and to discuss its effects.  In to tal, the Desk conducted sixty outright purchase operations in  Treasury securities, bringing the cumulative total purchases to $300 billion on the nose. The t op left panel shows the pace of purchases that we implemented over the program, includi ng the tapering of the purchases at the end of the program.  The top right panel shows the distribution of the securities purchased across maturities.  As was announced in a Desk statement at the start of the program, the purchases spanned all outstanding maturities beyond a year, but the majority of securities purchased were in th e two- to ten-year sector.  With these purchases, the Desk removed a considerable portion of the duration that was issued to the market over that period.November 3–4, 20096 of 201The middle two panels indicate that ma rket functioning has improved over the period covered by the purchase program.  The left panel shows the amount of dispersion across Treasury yields relative to our smoothed yield curve, which could be taken as a proxy for the degree to which balance sheet constraints and extreme risk aversion prevented relative value trading in  the market.  This measure has come in notably, with many attributing some of that  pattern to our purchases.  Liquidity measures for the Treasury market have also  improved.  Bid-asked spreads have also come in from the high levels earlier this year, and the depth of  market quotes, shown to the right, has risen. Overall, the Treas ury market has recovered notably from the strains during the crisis, and there are no signs that our pullback from the market is causing that improvement to reverse.  The other key issue is whether the Treasur y purchases, along with the other LSAP programs, were successful at lowering longe r-term yields.  Some have pointed to the fact that the 10-year Treasury yield has ri sen since the onset of  purchases and have used that fact to argue that the program was not effective.  We do not find that argument particularly compelling.  The pr oblem is that it fails to define the counterfactual of what would have happe ned to yields in the absence of the purchases. In fact, many regression models of longe r-term yields would have predicted them to rise over this period.  Th is can be seen from a modification of the Backus–Wright yield model from their 2007 Brookings publication, shown in the bottom left panel.  The fact that yields re main below the model’s prediction is at least suggestive that the asset purchases have ha d some effect.  A different approach to measuring the effects of asset purchases is  based on event-study.  As was presented to the Committee earlier in the year, this ex ercise takes a list  of dates on which important announcements were made about LSAPs and aggregates the movements in yields on those dates. The updated results, shown in the bottom right panel, indicate that the yield movements around LSAP announ cements were substantial.  Together, the regression and event-study evidence suggests that LSAP programs have had notable effects in lowering Tr easury yields.  We associate these effects primarily with changes to the stock of securities, arising through a portf olio balance channel, and hence we would not expect them to unwind as purchases end.  To date, that appears to be playing out. Indeed, the market barely  noticed the end of the Treasury purchase program—which is what we  had hoped would happen.  As I noted in the last briefing, we ar e somewhat more worried about how the markets will react to th e winding down of the agency debt and MBS purchase programs.  Even in those markets, however , the basic message is “so far so good.”  The top panels of exhibit 4 show the pace of  purchases for agency debt and MBS.  As can be seen, the Desk has begun to follow the tapering program that was decided at the last FOMC meeting.  This strategy w ill slowly reduce the pace of purchases while still getting to total levels consistent w ith the Desk directives.  For MBS, the projected path takes total purchases to $1.25 trillion.  For agency debt, the Desk directive had given us some flexibility, but we were following a path aimed at a total purchase amount of $175 billion."
127,20091216,"1 The materials used by Mr. Sack are appended to this transcript (appendix 1). December 15–16, 20094 of 247Transcript of the Federal Open  Market Committee Meeting on December 15–16, 2009 December 15, 2009—Afternoon Session CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Good afternoon, everybody. PARTICIPANTS. Good afternoon. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. We need a motion to close our meeting. MR. KOHN. So moved. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Our m eeting today and tomorrow follows the basic sequence we’ve been having recently, but with an important addition, which is that we have a staff presentation on infl ation dynamics.  We need about two hours for that presentation, I understand, and we’ve thought about it and decided to put it at th e end of the meeting so we would have plenty of time to complete our policy decision.  But I hope that people will pay attention to the time and make sure we have enough time tomorrow to give appropriate attention to the presentation. In that spirit, why don’t we start directly?  Mr. Sack. MR. SACK.1  Since the last FOMC meeting, fi nancial conditions have generally become more supportive of economic growth. Yields have declined at short- and intermediate-term maturities, and equity pr ices have posted a solid gain, while the dollar has remained about unchanged on net.  Some of the adjustment in financial ma rkets appears to have been driven by increased confidence among investors that shor t-term interest rates will remain low.  The repetition of the “extended period” la nguage in the November FOMC statement, along with the additional clarity provided by including explicit conditioning factors, seemed to solidify investors’ expecta tions that policy would remain on hold.  Subsequent speeches by FOMC members, in cluding comments that U.S. asset prices do not look obviously out of line with fundame ntals, were seen as providing further support to that view. In response, the exp ected path of monetary policy derived from   futures quotes shifted down as much as 35 basis points over the intermeeting period, as shown in the upper left panel.December 15–16, 20095 of 247The Bluebook noted that these futures rate s overstate what investors see as the most likely path for short-term interest rates, because they are influenced by the distribution of risks around th at outcome.  This point can be made by looking at options prices to derive the perceived probabilities of different outcomes for the short-term interest rate, as shown in the di stribution to the right.  According to that exercise, the most likely outcome for the three-month LIBOR rate about ten months from now is that it will remain in the 25 to  50 basis point range.  However, given the proximity of that outcome to the zero bound, the risk is skewed almost completely in the direction of higher rates,  pulling the mean of the dist ribution well above the mode.  As a result, the futures price, which corre sponds to the mean, is about 50 basis points above what is seen as the most likely outcome. With this consideration, there does not appear to be much discrepancy left between market-based measures of policy ex pectations and survey responses, if the latter captures the modal outcome seen by respondents.  Our primary dealer survey indicates that the median respondent expects the first tightening to occur in the fourth quarter of 2010, with a range of views that  spanned from the second quarter of 2010 to early 2012. We also used the survey to query de alers about their interpretation of the “extended period” language used in the FOMC  statement.  By far, the most common response was that the “exte nded period” language would be removed three meetings before an actual rate hike. We are happy to use future versions of the survey to quantify any timing of policy tightening that you want—such as “some time,” “a while,” “before long,” or, maybe to accommodate some Committee members, “immediately.” [Laughter] The lower expected path of  monetary policy contributed to a decline in shorter-term Treasury yields.  This adjustment occurred even though the incoming economic data were generally stronger than anticipate d.  As shown in the middle left panel, the two-year yield fell about 10 basis points, on net, while the 10-year yield posted a small increase.  At one point over the inte rmeeting period, the 2-y ear yield had dipped to 65 basis points—essentially equaling the lowest level on record, as shown in the middle right panel—although it has more r ecently retraced back above 80 basis points. The 10-year yield, at just over 3.5 perc ent, is also low by historical standards, though it is still well above the levels reached at the end of last year.   Yields remain at these low levels despite the fact that inflation concerns seem to be lingering. Some mark et participants continue  to discuss whether the accommodative monetary policy stance and expansionary fiscal policy will eventually lead to upward inflation pressu re.  Consistent with those concerns, the 5-year, 5-year forward break-even inflati on rate remains near the upper end of the range observed in recent years, as shown in the bottom left panel.December 15–16, 20096 of 247While we recognize that tec hnical factors can affect br eak-even rates, it seems that perceptions of inflation risk have at least contributed to their recent patterns.  Several observations support that view. First,  flows into mutual funds that invest in inflation-linked products have increased notably over the cour se of 2009, indicating elevated demand for inflation protection among retail investors.  Second, investors in the swaption market are paying an increasi ngly large premium for protection against a rise in longer-term interest rates, which coul d in part reflect con cerns about inflation expectations moving higher.  However, some  of the other patterns associated with inflation jitters, such as risi ng gold prices and a falling dolla r, have reversed course in recent weeks.  We will be watching closely to see if that reversal is a temporary head fake or a more persistent shift in trend.  Looking across global sovereign debt markets,  we find that another factor that has recently come into play is the perceived risk of default.  Given the fiscal challenges facing a wide range of countries, investor s have been reeval uating their views on sovereign default risk. One measure of this  risk, albeit an imperfect one because of the limited size of the market, is the prici ng of CDS on sovereign debt.  As shown to the right, there has been cons iderable upward pressure on th e yields of Greek debt as markets have grown concerned about the prospe ct of default.  Similar concerns have been expressed about Spain and Ireland, and th e fiscal situations in the U.S. and the U.K. have also been discussed in this context.  However, to date there appears to have been little upward pressure on U.S. yields from this factor. Overall, any upward pressure on Treasury yi elds arising from i nvestors’ concerns about longer-term inflation risks or the fiscal outlook is being dominated by the downward pressure arising from the prospect of low short-term interest rates for an extended period, leaving Treasury yields quite low. Turning to the next exhibit, better economic news and the prospect of accommodative short-term interest rates contributed to a further advance in the prices of some risky assets.  Most  notably, broad equity indexe s posted another sizable gain since the last FOMC meeting, with the S& P 500 index up more than 5 percent on net. One of the issues that I have addressed in recent briefings is  whether risky asset prices have risen too far. To help make  this judgment, we can look to valuation models, such as the Board’s measure of the equity premium.  This premium, shown to the right, still appears wide by historical standards, suggesting that the run-up in equity prices since earlier this year has not pushed them too high relative to fundamentals.  Similarly, an analysis of  corporate bond spreads suggests that their risk premiums are also not unusually narrow. Another approach to address this issue is to look across asset classes in order to see if all risky assets are rising, as such a pattern could imply an indiscriminate increase in risk tolerance on the part of investors.  Correlations in the movements across various asset classes, reported in th e middle left panel, have been unusually high over the past six months, compared w ith their levels a few years ago, with"

This will be an FOMC meeting for the first six items because it is an organizational meeting, and then at that point, if Matt reminds me, we will make it a joint meeting with the Board.  This is the annual organizational meeting.  Let me first recognize the Presidents rotating into voting status: Presidents Bullard, Hoenig, Pianalto, and Rosengren. Organizational item number 1 is the election of Committee officers.  Let me recognize Governor Kohn. MR. KOHN.  Thank you.  It is a pleasure and a privilege to nominate Ben Bernanke to be Chairman of this Committee.  I can’t think of a better person to herd all of these cats.  [Laughter]  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Is there a second? MR. WARSH .  Second. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Other nominations?  Without objection.  Thank you very much.  Governor Kohn. MR. KOHN.  It is also a pleasure and a privilege to nominate Bill Dudley to be the Vice Chairman of the Committee. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Second? MR. WARSH .  Second. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Without objection.  Thank you.  Item 1C is staff officers.  Would you please read the list, Matt. MR. LUECKE.  Secretary and Economist, Brian Madigan; Assistant Secretaries, Matt Luecke, David Skidmore, and Michelle Smith; General Counsel, Scott Alvarez; Deputy General January 26–27, 20104 of 260Counsel, Tom Baxter; Assistant General Counsel, Rich Ashton; Economists, Nathan Sheets and Dave Stockton; Associate Economists from the Board, Tom Connors, Bill English, Steve Kamin, Larry Slifman, and David Wilcox; and from the Banks, Christopher Waller, Mark Sni derman, Simon Potter, Jeff Fuhrer, and Alan Barkema.  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Any questions or comments?  If not, may I have a second for the motion that we approve these officers? MR. KOHN.  Second. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  All right.  Without objection.  Item number 2  is a proposed revision to the program for security of FOMC information.  You received a memo from Scott and Matt.  There is an essentially expositional change to add a summary of the rules that govern noncitizen access to FOMC information.  Are there any questions for Scott or Matt about this memorandum?  [No response]  Could I have a motion to adopt the revision? MR. TARULLO .  So moved. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Second? MR. WARSH .  Second. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Without objection.  Thank you.  Item n umber 3 is the selection of a Federal Reserve Bank to execute transactions for the System Open Market Account.  I have been informed that New York is again willing to serve.  Do we have a second? MR. KOHN.  I second. VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  We are rethinking that now.  [Laughter] CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  All right.  Without objection.  Thank you.  Number 4; now we are getting to the controversial items —selection of a Manager of the System Open Market Account.  Brian Sack is the incumbent.  Are there other nominations?  If not, any objections to January 26–27, 20105 of 260naming Brian Sack the Manager?  [No response]  The New York Federal Reserve Bank will have to find that acceptable.  We trust that they will.   Next, item 5  is a review of the authorization for domestic open market operations.  Let me turn this over to Brian to present the items.  There are four items here.  Would you like to discuss them briefly?   MR. SACK.  Yes.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The Committee reviews the Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations at its first meeting each year.  I propose a few amendments to the domestic authorization for the Committee to consider.  These changes were described in the memo that I sent to the Committee on the subject ahead of the meeting.  Let me highlight two major changes. First, I am proposing that the Committee expand the securities eligible for the repo pool offered to foreign, international, and fiscal agency account holders to include securities that are direct obligations of, or fully guaranteed as to princip al and interest by, any agency of the United States.  This change would, in effect, expand the range of SOMA assets to be used in these transactions to agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities, as opposed to the current authorization’s restriction to only Treasury securities.  This wider set of securities corresponds to those that are eligible for outright purchases or sales by the Desk.  This change would allow the Desk to optimally allocate the SOMA’s asset holdings across different tools and facilities going forward.  In particular, it would provide the Desk with additional collateral to offer as a repo facility to our customers, allowing Treasury collateral to be used as needed in other facilities or transactions. Second, I am proposing a change to the language in section 4.B so that it is more consistent with other sections of the authorization.  These changes include clarifying the term January 26–27, 20106 of 260"
129,20100316,"Even though market pricing suggests that the FOMC’s exit from  current rate levels is a ways off, investors seem sensitive to any news related to the exit.  For example, the increase in the discount rate came as a surprise to some, despite the fact that the FOMC minutes published a day earlier said that such an increase would “soon be appropriate .” This prompted discussion about the likely path of the Fed’s exit.  The announcement that the Treasury would increase the size of the SFP back to $200 billion was also widely discussed in this context.  The amount of focus on these two events highlights the market’s sensitivity to the issue of exit, although the net responses of asset prices were muted.      Although policy expectations were marked down slightly, Treasury yields edged higher over the intermeeting period, as shown in the upper right panel.  This pattern does not appear to be driven by perceived inflation risk.  Indeed, some of the concerns about inflation risk that had been priced into Treasury yields appear to be diminishing, as suggested by the decline in break-even inflation rates from their recent highs, shown in the middle left panel.  Moreover, measures of implied volatility and payer skew on longer-term interest rates have come down, presumably for related reasons. Government securities markets around the world have also had to contend with a greater focus by investors on sovereign credit risk.  As shown to the right, investors have been quite concerned about default prospects in Greece, and some of those perceived risks have spilled over at times into other countries in the European periphery.  Greece managed to placate those concerns to some degree by announcing several important steps towards fiscal austerity that, along with a statement of support from the European Council, enabled Greece to issue €5 billi on of new debt.  However, Greece still faces some near-term hurdles, as it has to issue a considerable amount of additional debt in coming months.  Nathan Sheets will discuss these developments in more detail in his briefing. Regardless of how the situation in Greece plays out over time, it has precipitated a wider discussion about sovereign credit risk across all major economies.  At this point, however, investors’ concerns about U.S. sovereign risk appear to be limited.  Indeed, as shown in the bottom le ft panel, CDS spreads on U.S. Treasuries have not widened in any meaningful way.  There has been some widening in the CDS spreads for U.S. states that face challenging fiscal situations, but those pressures have not passed through strongly into the cash market.  The municipal bond market continues to benefit from strong investor inflows, spreads on municipal bonds have narrowed, and issuance by municipalities has been solid, despite the continued deterioration of fiscal conditions in various states. The ev ents surrounding Greece appear to have had an impact on currency values, contributing to the euro’s weakness against the dollar, shown in the bottom right.  In addition, other countries facing fiscal challenges, such as the U.K., also saw their currencies weaken against the dollar. March 16, 20104 of 146This intermeeting period included several notable events for the Federal Reserve’s liquidity facilities.  A number of the facilities closed on February 1, including the PDCF, the CPFF, the AMLF, the TSLF, and the currency swaps with foreign central banks; in addition, the TAF conducted its last auction on March 8.  Accordingly, all of the short-term credit facilities that were introduced during the crisis are now inactive, in that there will be no additional operations.  The outstanding credit provided by those facilities, shown in the upper left panel of exhibit 2, has reached minimal levels and, by June, will be confined to just the primary credit facility.       The markets have adjusted well to the withdrawal of this credit.  As shown by the LIBOR-OIS spreads to the right, there has been no evidence of any reemergence of market strains as the facilities have wound down. Another facility that is approaching its end is the TALF.  The final subscription for non-CMBS took place on March 4, and the final subscription for legacy CMBS will occur later this week.  After that subscription, the only remaining operations will be in new-issue CMBS —an asset class for which there are currently no outstanding TALF loans.  Subscriptions in new-issue CMBS will continue until their scheduled end date in June. As shown in the middle left panel, the cumulative volume of borrowings from the TALF has expanded fairly steadily in recent months.  However, the volume of repayments of TALF loans has also risen, as borrowers have been able to secure funding from other sources on more favorable terms.  As a result, the net amount of outstanding credit from the TALF has leveled out to some degree and currently stands at around $50 billion.  That balance will presumably decline going forward as repayments continue. Securitized credit markets have not shown much strain from the termination of the TALF program.  As indicated to the right, spreads on ABS remain tight.  Moreover, ABS issuance has been fairly strong, and only about one-fifth of the issuance this year has been financed by the TALF.  A survey of TALF-eligible ABS issuers suggested that the expiration of the TALF will not significantly affect the use of securitization as a source of funding for auto loans and credit cards.  Nevertheless, the securitization market faces several challenges going forward, including uncertainty about the balance sheet treatment of the assets supporting ABS and the consequent impact on the cost of funding through securitization. Other risky asset prices continue to fare well, supported by decent earnings and ongoing evidence that an economic recovery is taking hold.  Major U.S. equity indexes advanced about 5 percent over the intermeeting period, as shown in the bottom left panel, and measures of implied volatility on equity prices dropped back sharply.  Corporate bond spreads, shown to the right, narrowed modestly over the intermeeting period. March 16, 20105 of 146Your next exhibit focuses on the Fed’s large -scale asset purchase (LSAP) programs.  We are nearing the end of the programs.  MBS purchases are on track to meet the $1.25 trillion target, with only $20 billion of additional purchases needed to reach that goal.  Agency debt purchases have fallen somewhat behind the schedule that would be needed to reach $175 billion.  Our purchases currently stand at just over $170 billion, and we have only one more operation scheduled, which is likely be around $1 billion in size.      Even as our purchases have slowed, the spreads on agency debt and MBS have remained tight, as indicated in the middle panels.  This pattern has led market participants to reassess the vulnerability of the market to an increase in rates as our purchases end.  The current view among market participants is that the MBS spread may widen only marginally, by 10 basis points or so, as our purchases come to a close.  That estimate is down substantially from their earlier estimates; indeed, just six months ago, the average response in one of our surveys was 60 basis points.  We continue to believe that the LSAPs helped to lower longer-term interest rates, and that those effects will only slowly unwind as the stock of the Fed’s holding s gradually declines. With our purchases ending, it is a good time to assess how the program has left the functioning of the MBS market.  As shown in the bottom left panel, our holdings of MBS represent a sizable portion of the outstanding supply across the coupon stack, particularly in the most active coupons.  Over time, the share of our holdings will decline, as we receive prepayments and as new issuance of MBS comes to the market.  However, this decline has yet to materialize, despite the slower pace of our purchases, because of the tepid pace of new issuance. Overall, the market has had to adjust to our large presence —and particularly to having less tradable float than it would in our absence.  As I highlighted in my last briefing, our holdings have contributed to the unusually large volume of settlement fails in the market in recent months, shown in the bottom right panel.  However, this situation has improved notably in recent weeks.  Moreover, trading volume in the MBS market has remained healthy even as our own transaction activity in the market has faded.  Thus, while our presence has caused some strains, the market seems to be functioning with decent liquidity in most areas. Your final exhibit discusses the Fed’s balance sheet and the issue of wh ether the FOMC may want to redeem its maturing holdings of Treasury securities.  The overall size of the balance sheet currently stands at $2.3 trillion.  As shown in the upper left panel, about $2.0 trillion of that is associated with the outright holdings of securities in the domestic SOMA portfolio.  These holdings have expanded rapidly with the purchases of agency debt and agency MBS; in addition, our Treasury holdings have returned to near $800 billion. The expansion of the SOMA portfolio has been accompanied by a notable shift in its risk characteristics.  Most important, as shown in the upper right panel, the March 16, 20106 of 146"
130,20100428,"Transcript of the Federal Open Market Committee Meeting on April 27–28, 2010 April 27—Afternoon Session CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Good afternoon, everybody.  First Vice President Holcomb will be sitting in for President Fisher today —welcome, Helen. Before I begin the formal part of the meeting, I think we ought to acknowledge an epochal event in the history of the Federal Reserve.  Toda y is Don Kohn’s last FOMC meeting, assuming, of course, that he retires as he plans.  [Laughter]  That’s a lwa ys a risk. MR. LACKER.  Don’t worry, Don.  You’ re going.  [Laughter] CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I think it should be noted that since 1981 Don has attended 221 FOMC meetings, in a range of capacities, and missed only eight meetings in the past 30 years.  So I wonder about those eight meetings.  [Laughter and applause]  We will have an informal opportunity to say good-bye to Don and to thank him and honor him for all of his enormous contributions.  But I just wanted to take say how much we appreciate what you ’ve done and, personally, how much I owe you and the institution owes you for your contributions over many years, and particularly over the last couple of years. MR. KOHN.  Thank you. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I need a motion to close the Board meeting. MR. KOHN.  So moved.  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well done. MR. KOHN.  I got that.  You need to know when to say, “So moved.”  [Laughter]  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Governor Kohn is a little punchy today, I think. All right.  Our first item of business is our briefing on financial developments, open market operations, and system facilities.  Let me turn first to Brian Sack. April 27–28, 20104 of 206MR. SACK.1  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Investors continued to become more confident in the economic recovery over the intermeeting period, prompting a further rise in asset prices that will, in turn,  provide additional support for the economy.  The gains in the equity market were sharp, with the S&P 500 index advancing by more than 5 percent, as shown in the upper left panel.  In addition to greater optimism about the economy, equity prices were supported by earnings releases for the first quarter that have generally exceeded analyst expectations.  Despite the ongoing appreciation of equity prices, the staff’s measure of the equity premium remains sizable, as shown in the upper right.      1 The materials used by Mr. Sack are appended to this transcript (appendix 1). Corporate bond spreads, shown in the middle left panel, narrowed further over the intermeeting period, owing to the same factors pushing equity prices higher.  Expectations for corporate defaults continued to decline, as corporations have healthy balance sheets and ample access to markets. Securitized credit markets also showed signs of improvement.  Spreads on outstanding asset-backed securities generally narrowed, and issuance of ABS has been decent across several sectors, despite the expiration of the TALF for most asset types.  Spreads on CMBS, shown to the right, narrowed sharply over the intermeeting period, as investors sought higher yields and felt that the stress in the commercial real estate sector may be less severe than previously anticipated. Even the new-issue market for securities related to real estate has shown signs of life.  A multi-borrower new-issue CMBS was brought to the market, the first since 2008, and several large banks are reportedly preparing deals for the second and third quarters.  In addition, the first non-agency RMBS issue since 2007 was brought to the market.  Both of these deals were heavily oversubscribed, though it should be noted that they were relatively small, had very high-quality loans as collateral, and had simple structures.  If I had to make up a term for it, I might call these deals “greenshoots.”  [Laughter]  Note that the CMBS deal did not seek TALF support because it was priced well in the market.  Even though the TALF remains open for new-issue CMBS through June, it is very unlikely that we will have any new deals coming to the program. Prospects for financial institutions also generally improved, though a number of risks surround this sector.  Nearly 75 percent of financial institutions reported first-quarter earnings that beat expectations, reflecting strong capital market and trading results and lower than expected loan loss provisions.  As shown in the bottom left panel, equity prices for both the largest institutions and regional banks gained sharply through mid- April.  However, the SEC’s announcement on April 16 of legal action against Goldman Sachs took a toll on the share prices of that firm and other institutions that investors felt could face similar questions.  In addition, this sector is subject to considerable uncertainty related to pending legislation on financial regulation.                                                  April 27–28, 20105 of 206Another area of concern among investors is the situation in Greece, which was a key focal point of financial markets over the intermeeting period.  Nathan Sheets will cover in detail recent developments regarding the possibility of an economic support package for Greece from the EU and the IMF.  Uncertainty about whether such a package would be available and about the feasibility of the longer-run fiscal adjustments that are needed caused a significant widening of Greek bond spreads over the intermeeting period, as shown in the bottom right panel, which shows data only through yesterday.  Moreover, the concerns about Greece have spilled over into other debt markets in peripheral Europe, with yield spreads in Portugal and Ireland increasing notably.  While the chart shows data through yesterday, the situation took a turn for the worse today, with S&P’s decision to downgrade its sovereign credit ratings of Greece and Portugal.  Markets came under pressure in response, with the yield spread on Greek debt jumping more than 200 basis points and the yield spread for Portugal increasing over 100 basis points today.  These developments have contributed to a further weakening of the euro relative to the dollar.  However, through yesterday at least, we had not seen any broader spillover from the pressure on those European debt markets to U.S. financial markets.     As shown in the upper left panel of exhibit 2, the greater optimism about the economic outlook did not cause a shift in near-term expectations of monetary policy.  The stability of policy expectations likely owed in part to the retention of the “extended period” language in the March FOMC statement and in other communications.  The current configuration of rates suggests that policy tightening is not expected to commence until late this year or early 2011.  The responses from the Desk’s recent survey of primary dealers and buy -side market participants were largely consistent with that outlook.  As shown to the right, respondents placed the highest probabilities on the first tightening occurring in either the second half of this year or the first half of next year. Even though near-term policy expectations remained steady, Treasury yields moved higher, as shown in the middle left panel.  The 10-year yield at one point touched 4 percent before retracing in recent weeks.  On balance, most Treasury coupon yields increased 10 to 20 basis points over the intermeeting period. While the greater optimism about the economic outlook contributed to the rise in Treasury yields, it also appeared that supply pressures were pushing rates higher at times.  One sign of the effects of supply comes from the behavior of swap spreads.  Those spreads, shown to the right, have reached unusually tight levels by historical standards, perhaps reflecting some upward pressure on Treasury yields.  Such pressure could also be reflected in the upward drift in the term premium, shown in the bottom left panel, which remains higher than its levels in recent years. Given these and other indications of supply concerns, the Treasury is anxious to begin reducing the sizes of its coupon offerings.  The Treasury is likely to announce that it is starting that process in its quarterly refunding statement next week.  Of course, the Treasury’s debt management strategy would have to take into account any  April 27–28, 20106 of 206"
131,20100509,"of guarantee mechanism for euro debt, plus, we  hope —although we’re not certain—that there will be new austerity measures from Portugal and Spain, and additional mechanisms or steps may be taken as well.  We know that things are being discussed, but nothing concrete has been agreed upon. Very importantly, the European Central Bank this morning had a meeting of its Executive Board and came to some ver y significant decisions.  Jean-Claude Trichet shared them with me this morning on a highly confidential basis.  Of course, I want to tell you about them, but this is extremely confidential, so please take that into account.  The ECB is very concerned about the situation, and you will be able to see that in terms of the actions that they have decided to take. First, they will be restoring their three-month and six-month fixed-rate tenders, which essentially provide an unlimited supply of funding to their banking system at fixed rates over three and six months; from their perspective, this amounts to reopening the unusual liquidity measures that they had shut down before.  That is important, but it’s not the most important thing.  The novel intervention, and one that  will be highly controversial in Europe, and probably here as well, is that the ECB is preparing to have an open-ended intervention policy in any market that they deem dysfunction al or illiquid.  That means that they will stand ready to buy any public or private security, denominated in euros, t hat’s traded in a market in which there is dysfunction or disorderly movement.  There will be no limit to the amount that they are going to be prepared to buy. The philosophy underlying this is, I think,  analogous to foreign exchange rate intervention; that is, they’ re not setting up a fixed amount that they are going to buy, as we did with our securities purchases, and they are not setting up a facility that will buy bonds as offered at a fixed rate.  Ra ther , they are going to enter markets tactically and randomly in ways that will May 9, 20104 of 42try to make it expensive for speculators to bet against European bonds or even against private securities like the debt of European banks.  They intend to sterilize their purchases, so that the net effect of these purchases on the monetary base will be nil or small.  By doing so, they hope to protect the euro and to avoid any spillover into inflation expectations.  So, to summarize, this will be a market-oriented intervention, with the goal of stabilizing markets and preventing momentum-driven speculation from creating problems beyond the fundamental problems.  It’s worth asking whether or n ot this will be effective.  It’ s certainly an interesting approach, and I suspect it will have at least some short-term effects.  But it cannot solve the long er-term problem without fiscal support and fiscal action. The ECB is waiting to hear the outcome of the Ecofin meeting.  The ECB has not yet taken legal steps, and it will not announce anything until tonight —Jean-Claude assures me that they will not take these actions unless they are persuaded that there is real help coming on the fiscal side.  They view themselves as kind of “hol ding the fort ” for a short period until the fiscal/political side can take the necessary action.  So we will see —as I said, I have a call at 2:00 p.m., and I ’m sure I will get all of the Ecofin news at that time. I just want to emphasize —and I think it’ s obvious to everybody —what an extraordinary step this is, particularly for the ECB, which has been relatively conservative on market interventions.  It shows that they are very, very concerned about the situation.  As I said, I would also characterize Trichet’s call to me as being a personal appeal.  He feels it is very important for us to support him, and he understands our concerns, which, I will,  of course,  discuss.  I got very much some of the same tone from Mervyn King, and, to a lesser extent, even from Shirakawa, who says that Japan is also facing pressure, and they are very concerned about contagion. May 9, 20105 of 42Turning to the swaps, in a moment,  I’m going to give Brian Sack a chance to comment in more detail on interbank markets and on the foreign exchange markets, and give us some more analysis of the market implications of this, so that we can all make our own assessments.  M y own view is that the swaps would be substantively helpful in addressing some of the interbank flows and certain other problems there.  Moreover, everybody I ’ve talked to about this in the central banking world thinks that at least as important as the direct effect on the dollar funding problems would be the psychological effects of an international coordinated effort in size that supplements the main actions, which have to be in Europe.  I think we all agree that this is not going to work unless the Europeans are taking the lead and are taking strong steps towards addressing the fiscal actions.  My own view is that, absent any political considerations, this would be a pretty easy call, in that it would support financial markets, both globally and in Europe, and would be an important indicator  of solidarity.  I noted this morning that Vice President Biden is in Europe and said that the United States would do everything possible to assist the Europeans ; I think that that symbolism is also very important. That being said, as you know, we can’t ignore the politics of this by any means.  I think the Sanders amendment is now in a good place in terms of providing independence to monetary policy and to other activities, including the discount window and  international transactions.  The vote on that is currently planne d for Tuesday.  Clearly, there’ s some risk that action of the sort that we’re contemplating would be portrayed as a bailout or another Federal Reserve unilateral action.  I think that, to be responsible, we really do have to take into account those kinds of risks, because they could affect the integrity of the Federal Reserve going forward.  So  I think it is an appropriate consideration as we discuss the substance of this issue. May 9, 20106 of 42"

Let me update you on our Board nominees.  With some luck, we expect to have hearings before the Senate Banking Committee in the next three weeks or so.  And with some skill and luck, we might have our additional members here for the August meeting.  However, because we remain without reinforcements —[laughter] —I took the liberty of asking Governor Kohn to hang around for another meeting, and he very kindly agreed.  That will not stop us from honoring you tomorrow at lunch, but we appreciate your willingness to stay on for a bit longer. As usual, this is a joint Board–FOMC meeting, so I need a motion to close the meeting.  MR. KOHN.  So moved. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  The first item is our briefing on financial developments, open market operations, and System facilities.  Brian, you have a lot of work to do today.  Let me turn to you first for open market developments. MR. SACK.1  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The evolving fiscal situation in Europe and worries about global economic growth prospects dominated the attention of financial market participants over the intermeeting period.  Investors have remained concerned about the fiscal positions of some European countries, despite the austerity measures and other policy efforts announced to date.  Those concerns have been reflected in the pricing of sovereign risk for countries in the so-called European periphery, as indicated by the yield spreads shown in the upper left panel of the first exhibit.  The policy steps announced by the European Commission and the European Central Bank on May 10 led to an immediate and significant improvement in those spreads, but they have widened since then as investors have questioned whether the steps taken are sufficient to mitigate the risks involved.  1 The materials used by Mr. Sack are appended to this transcript (appendix 1). The developments surrounding sovereign debt have also amplified investors’ concerns about the health of European financial institutions perceived to have                                                  June 22–23, 20104 of 213significant exposures to these countries.  The pressures on these institutions arise from their direct exposures to sovereign debt, from questions about the ability of their respective governments to backstop them, and from the contractionary effects of the fiscal adjustments required in some countries.  In response, share prices of euro-area banks have fallen significantly since the beginning of the year, and CDS spreads, shown in the upper right, have moved up notably.      These developments have generated strains in short-term funding markets, including those for dollars.  Many European financial institutions still hold large amounts of dollar-denominated assets and finance a sizable portion of those holdings in short-term dollar-denominated funding markets.  In the presence of concerns about the status of these institutions, investors have become more reluctant to extend term funding to many of them. This reluctance has pushed term funding rates higher, with the spread of the three-month U.S. dollar LIBOR relative to OIS moving above 30 basis points, as shown in the middle left panel.  Moreover, forward rates suggest that the LIBOR-OIS spread is expected to continue widening in coming months to near 50 basis points.  That is a significant improvement relative to late May, when the LIBOR-OIS spread was expected to surpass 70 basis points, but it is still indicative of a market under pressure. As shown to the right, the amount of commercial paper issued in U.S. markets by foreign financial institutions has been falling, a further sign of the pullback by investors.  Moreover, many European institutions have had to shift their funding into shorter tenors, with some institutions limited to maturities of a week or less.  The market has had a somewhat more favorable tone over the past several weeks, with some core European firms reportedly able to obtain longer-term funding on better terms, but such funding remains unavailable for many European institutions. One factor that has likely influenced the dynamics of funding conditions is the presence of the liquidity swap arrangements that the Federal Reserve established with the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the European Central Bank, the Swis s National Bank, and the Bank of Japan.  There is currently only a very small amount of credit extended through the liquidity swap arrangements, as shown in the bottom left panel.  The limited usage of the swaps reflects the fact that their pricing is stil l unattractive relative to the funding rates available in the market.  Nevertheless, the presence of the swaps has provided a backstop for dollar funding markets and has likely helped to prevent a more significant deterioration. In contrast to the limited activity in its dollar operations, the ECB has been actively providing euro-denominated funding to the markets.  Indeed, to address the demand for euros, the ECB decided to return to a fixed-rate, full-allotment offering at its three-month open market operations, and it added a six-month operation as well.  As shown in the bottom right panel, the amount of euros injected by open market operations has risen from already high levels.  At the same time, the amount of funds June 22–23, 20105 of 213on deposit at the ECB has been increasing rapidly.  These patterns indicate that the ECB has increasingly acted as an intermediary, providing funds to those counterparties who cannot find them on favorable terms in the market and taking in funds from other counterparties.       In an attempt to provide more confidence to investors, European Union leaders announced late last week that they would release the results of stress tests for some of the largest European financial institutions, although further details remain limited at this time. The dev elopments in Europe have had implications for broader financial conditions in the United States.  As shown in the upper left panel of exhibit 2, the euro has depreciated notably against the dollar since early this year, with the movement becoming more rapid over the intermeeting period.  On net, the dollar has gained 6 percent against the euro since the last FOMC meeting. At the same time, investors have become more wary of holding risky assets over the past two months, causing broad equity indexes to fall sharply, as shown in the upper right panel.  This flight from risk has been driven in large part by the deepening concerns about the European fiscal situation and its potential consequences for global growth.  However, some weak domestic data releases and considerable uncertainties surrounding regulatory reform efforts have likely contributed to this movement as well.  On balance, the S&P 500 index has declined more than 5 percent since the last FOMC meeting. As shown in the middle left panel, those same factors have led to some widening of corporate bond spreads, a notable shift from the steady rally since early 2009.  Similarly, some backtracking has been observed in the spreads on other private credit instruments, such as commercial mortgage-backed securities and, to a much lesser extent, consumer-related asset-backed securities.  The greater concerns about growth prospects, along with the uncertainties associated with regulatory reform efforts, have weighed on U.S. financial institutions.  Share prices of those institutions have modestly underperformed the broader market, and CDS spreads for these institutions have risen some on average, as shown to the right.  Note that U.S. financial institutions have not been strongly affected by the pressures in dollar funding markets, in part because they are seen by investors as more creditworthy and are not as reliant as some European institution on unsecured term funding.   Going forward, the evolution of the fiscal situation in Europe will continue to pose risks across global financial markets.  Our recent survey of primary dealers provides a snapshot into how the situation may evolve, with the range of outcomes considered listed in the bottom left panel.  Even though respondents put significant odds on the possibility that meaningful fiscal austerity measures would be implemented, they still saw a sizable chance that one or more credit events would June 22–23, 20106 of 213"
133,20100810,"Transcript of the Federal Open Market Committee Meeting on August 10, 2010 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Good morning, everybody.  As usual, this is a joint FOMC –Board meeting.  I need a motion to close the Board meeting. MR. KOHN.  So moved.  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  I’ m sure most of you know that we tried very hard to get our additional Board members confirmed in time for this meeting.  Unfortunately, it was not to be.  We hope that, when the Senate returns in September, we will have action; but, for today, I have once again asked Governor Kohn to lend us his wisdom.  This is absolutely, positively [laughter ] Don’s last meeting, and we thank you, Don, for once again helping us out.  Don will, in fact, without any contingency, be leaving on Septemb er 1.  And we thank you again for your service and for helping us make these difficult decisions. September 1 is also a sad day, because it will be the last day for our colleague, Brian Madigan.  Brian is very modest about being recognized, so it took a direct order from the Chairman to get him even to come to the beginning of this meeting.  [Laughter]  Brian has attended 145 scheduled FOMC meetings, and he became both the FOMC Secretary and the head of the Monetary Affairs Division in August of 2007 —I’m not ascribing any causality there.  Brian has made enormous contributions, as you all recognize.  He has given us about six or seven years’  worth of work in the last three years, and his dedication and his insight have been extraordinarily helpful.  To honor his service, w e have put together a little gift for Brian, signed dollar bills.  No one has ever explained to me why signing these bills is legal, by the way. [Laughter].  Brian, thank you for all you have done for the Federal Reserve.  [Extended applause].  Do you want to say something, Brian? August 10, 20104 of 160MR. MADIGAN.  Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.  It has been a privilege to serve on the Board staff and on the Committee staff for a number of years, especially for the past two years when the Federal Reserve has played such a critical role.  I want to thank you again for all the support and help you have given me and, again, for the privilege of being able to serve the Committee.  Thanks again. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you, Brian.  [Applause]  Well, on that sad note, let me just remind everybody that today is a one- day meeting, so we’ ll need to be especially efficient to accomplish everything on our agenda. Before I turn to the financial briefing, Vice Chairman Dudley wants to introduce someone. VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I would like to introduce Annmarie Rowe-Straker, who is sitting next to Brian Sack.  Annmarie is joining us from the Mark ets Group at the New York Fed.  Welcome, Annmarie, to your first meeting. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Welcome.  Let’s begin, then, with our  first item, which is a briefing on financial developments, and I’ ll turn to Brian Sack. MR. SACK.1  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Concerns about the outlook for economic growth led market participants to lower their expected path of short-term interest rates sharply and to begin discussing other steps the FOMC could take to increase the degree of policy accommodation. As shown in the upper left panel of your first exhibit, the expected path of the federal funds rate derived from futures quotes has fallen dramatically over the past two intermeeting periods, and the FOMC is now expected to keep the federal funds rate near its current target range until late next year.  Similarly, the Desk’s survey of primary dealers, shown to the right, indicated that the most likely timing of the first policy tightening has shifted back notably, namely, to the latter part of 2011. In addition, market participants have increasingly focused on four possible steps that the FOMC could take to make its policy setting more accommodativ e:  reduce the interest rate on excess reserves (the IOER rate), modify the policy language to                                                  1 The materials used by Mr. Sack are appended to this transcript (appendix 1). August 10, 20105 of 160convey more strongly the FOMC’s intention to maintain a very low federal funds rate for a long period, reinvest the principal repayments from the System’s holdin gs of agency debt and mortgage-backed securities (MBS), or expand the balance sheet by purchasing even larger amounts of those securities.  As indicated in the middle left panel, the median response to the Desk survey placed about one-third probability on the FOMC adopting stronger policy language or reinvesting maturing proceeds by the end of the year, with smaller probabilities assigned to a cut in the IOER rate or an expansion of the balance sheet.  It should be noted that these readings were taken before the more extensive discussion of these options in the financial press over the past week, and it is likely that the perceived odds have risen since our survey. The recent economic data have been a key driver of this shift in sentiment and have led market participants to mark down their outlook for GDP growth and to reassess the distribution of risks around their forecasts.  However, FOMC communications also played an important role, as they conveyed a shift in the Committee’s economic outlook and at least  opened the door to more aggressive policy actions. The revision to policy expectations strongly influenced Treasury yields, as shown in the middle right panel.  The two-year yield fell to around 50 basis points —the lowest level on record.  Across the curve, Treasury coupon yields declined 10 to 50 basis points, with the most pronounced declines at intermediate maturities.   The fall in longer-term Treasury yields was driven by both the shift in monetary policy prospects and a decline in the term premium.  As shown in the bottom left panel, one measure of the term premium embedded in the 10-year Treasury yield has declined to around 25 basis points.  Expectations that the FOMC could begin purchasing Treasury securities as part of a broader reinvestment strategy may have contributed to this decline in recent weeks. As shown in the bottom right panel, the decline in nominal yields has been accompanied by a fall in breakeven inflation rates.  Benign incoming data on inflation and heightened concerns about the economic recovery apparently led to a modest decline in expected inflation.  Market participants have also begun to discuss the risk of deflation to a greater degree than in the past.  However, as best as we can tell, they still seem to view a prolonged deflation as a fairly remote possibility, holding the Chairman to his 2002 promise to make sure “it” doesn’t happen here.  Despite ongoing concerns about the economic growth outlook, investors became slightly more comfortable holding risky assets over the intermeeting period.  As shown in the upper left panel of exhibit 2, U.S. equity prices recovered in recent weeks to leave them slightly higher than they were at the time of the last meeting.  Similarly, corporate bond yield spreads narrowed slightly, on balanc e. These assets were supported by second-quarter earnings reports that were generally stronger than expected.  However, a more important factor boosting these asset prices was the sense among investors that the chances of a sharp deterioration of August 10, 20106 of 160"
134,20100921,"generally there’s a substant ial overlap of views between the voting members and nonvoting members, and we’re able to represent the full range of the discussion.  But in the first round of the review of the minutes from the last meeting, it was felt that that was not the case. I’ve ha d some discussions with Scott and with the Secretariat.  This matter was actually raised at the December 2004 FOMC meeting, when we discussed the more rapid turnaround of the minutes .  There’s a very longstanding tradition of restricting that paragraph to the views of the members. That being said, I certainly believe, and I’m sure that we all agree, that the minutes ought to reflect the full range of discussion at the table and not just the views of those who happen to be in the voting cycle.  We were able to do that this time by looking for overlaps between views expressed by participants and members, by including additional material, and so on.  So let me just assure everybody that we will continue to maintain the principle that the full range of views should be reflected in the minutes, and we will find ways to do that. I think changing the current structure of the minutes is something we would not do lightly.  It’s a very longstanding tradition, and if we want to change it, I think we need to have a fuller discussion.  President Plosser, do you want to comment?  If anyone wants to comment, I can take one or two comments, but if we want to go into this in greater detail, we probably need to put it on the agenda for a future meeting.   Do you want to make a comment? MR. PLOSSER.  Let me just make one or two comments.  I think this is an important issue,  because it’s about transparency—it’s a bout making sure that the minutes reflect the range of the discussion.  Mr. Chairman, you’re correct, that, given the tu rnove r in members, oftentimes the differences in views between members and participants aren’t that great.   This time happened to be more unusual in that regard. September 21, 20104 of 151I understand the longstanding tradition of focusing the policy paragraph on why the members chose to do what they did.  Because we distinguish between members and participants in other sections of the minutes,  I’m not convinced particularly that you can’t carry out a similar strategy in that paragraph, talking about what members said, what participants said, and then at the end noting that the members decided “X.”  The alternative would be, I would think, to expand the economic go-round, where you do talk a lot about members and participants.  You could open that section up more to policy discussions between members and participants, even if you kept the policy paragraph focused on the members. I think we ought to be able to find a way to make sure that this long tradition of distinguishing between what members and  participants say gets incorporated,  because,  otherwise,  I do worry that down the road somebody is going to look at the transcripts and the minutes and find a disconnect, and I don’t think that would serve us well.   So I would encourage continued work  on this, and I think we ought to have some process that ensures that this happens in some way.  Those are my comments. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Bill, did you have a comment? MR. ENGLISH.  I just wanted to point out one thing.  In the structure of the minutes, until you get to the policy paragraph, ev erything is in terms of the participants.  So there isn’t a separate discussion of participants versus members at that point. MR. PLOSSER.  Oh, is that right? MR. ENGLISH.  It’s all in terms of participants, and then in the policy round, it’s in terms of members. MR. PLOSSER.  I stand corrected then. September 21, 20105 of 151CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I agree with what you said, President Plosser.  On the one hand you need to have this correspondence of the members because, for one thing, we report their votes.  MR. ENGLISH.   Right. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  That being said, I think that there are plenty of ways to make sure that there is substantial description of the discussion so that everybody’s views are represented.  President Lacker. MR. LACKER.  I was a participant in the December 2004 discussion —a member actually.  I’ve always been curious about this disconnect and expressed to the Chairman at the time that it seemed to me more logical to have a broader reporting. I wasn’t aware of Scott’s interpretation of the Federal Reserve Act.  Personally, I can’t see why it would preclude reporting on participants’ policy views.  The widespread understanding of anyone who has paid attention to this issue, including people outside the Fed , is that participants’ policy views a re not reported in the minutes —they do not appear.  Are we changing that or finding a way to finesse it?  I ask because this overlap strategy leaves open the possibility that a participant may express a view orthogonal to members’ views while the minutes remain silent on that. CHAIR MAN BERNANKE.  Well, I just point out this hasn’t been a significant problem in the past. MR. LACKER.  Right. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  This is the first time this has come up in quite a while.  So the principle is that, while the minutes wouldn’t cover every single minor point that anyone makes, all of the important views ought to be reflected in the minutes.  I think we can do that September 21, 20106 of 151"
135,20101015,"issues, but I want to reassure you that anything you say does not commit you to any particular policy position in November. I’d like to structure the meeting as follows.  In a moment, we ’ll start with a presentation by Board staff, followed by Q&A.  Then we ’ll have a go-round of participants to get your feedback on those presentations as well as on the material you received that was prepared both by the Board and by a few Reserve Banks.  I don’t anticipate having any vo tes or final decisions today —this meeting is really just for information-gathering and getting initial impressions.  That being said, as Debbie properly indicated, this is a meeting, not a briefing, in that we would expect you to make comments relevant to policy.   I’m not going to ask for presentations from the authors of the two Reserve Bank memos, but, certainly, if you have questions for them, or if you would like to refer to their work in your own discussion, that ’s obviously appropriate. Before we get into the main content of our meeting, I did want to ask your assent to add another item to the agenda of the November 2 and 3 meeting on the subject of external communications by both participants and staff of the FOMC.   Just to give you a bit of advance notice, let me tell you a couple of things I ’m concerned about and would like to talk about at more length.  First, I was very disappointed, as I know many of you were, to see a few months ago some stories in the press that showed access to considerable inside information, including quotes of what people said at FOMC meetings, staff materials, and the like.  I did circulate a memo on this problem, but we never discuss ed it as a group.  I think it might be worthwhile to have some discussion of those kinds of issues collectively.   Second, I think many of you also saw a Reuters article that suggested —and I don’t know if this is tr ue or not —that there may be leaks to non-media outsiders, including market participants, former officials, consultants, and others, some of whom stand to make money by their inside access either to participants or to staff.   If this is in fact true, it ’s October 15, 20104 of 62obviously a serious problem and one that could even have legal consequences.  So I think we need to discuss that issue as well at the November 2 meeting. A third and final issue that I’d like to include in that item on the agenda for November is not really a security issue, but it does concern me, in any case.  I perceive an increasing tendency of FOMC participants to stake out strong policy positions in advance of our meetings.  Now, it ’s perfectly fine for people to give their own views, and that has been a long-standing tradition; but I think that it has also been our tradition that when participants express their individual views, they do so in a way that emphasizes the collegiality of our process, the consensus nature of our process, and the fact that our decisions are made collectively in the FOMC.  If everybody has already made up their mind before the meeting, why don’t we just phone in the vote s and save ourselves the travel?  This idea of trying to maintain at least some plausible deniability and some reference to the Committee’s prerogative to make decisions is in the memorandum that Michelle put together and that all participants receive when they join.  Y ou can review that for your reference, if you’d like.   Now, we may decide that this implicit contract, if there is one, has become outdated .  In any event, it does strike me that, although it’s good for pe ople to know what our views are and for us to air differences and so on, the public may perceive the Committee to be more fractured than it, in fact, is, and that clarity and communication may suffer as a result. This issue is really a subjective one, and it may or may not warrant any further action.  The other two issues , though, obviously raise security issues, and we need to make sure we ’re comfo rtable with how things are going.  I will want to raise with you on November 2 the possibility that we might, for example, appoint a small subcommittee to look into strengthening our rules or strengthening our procedures to make sure that we have adequate confidentiality.   I don’t want to discuss these issues now, but I wanted to get your assent to put this on the agenda for, say, October 15, 20105 of 6245 minutes —not too much time, I hope —at the beginning of our next meeting.  Will that be acceptable to the Commit tee?  I’m seein g nods.  Okay, we will begin our discussion next time with some of these communication issues.   Thank you for that. I will now turn back to the main subject of our meeting, which is the policy framework, communication, and tools.  To repeat, you received two memos from the Board, one on the framework, one on policy tools.  Let me turn first to Michael Kiley, who will give a short presentation.  Mike Leahy will then present material on tools, and then we ’ll have Q&A from the Committee.  Michael. MR. KILEY.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  One of the background notes sent to the Committee earlier this week discussed issues related to the possible adoption of a new policy framework, including the specification of objectives, tools, strategy, and communications. With regard to the specification of objectives, the memo highlighted three approaches, each of which includes a summary of the FOMC’s interpretation of the statutory mandate to promote “maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates .” Under the qualitative mandate approach, the FOMC statement would provide a qualitative assessment of current inflation and unemployment in light of the Committee’s statutory objectives.  It would also indicate whether employment and inflation are expected to converge toward the Committee’s longer -run goals at an acceptable rate without further policy action in the near future.  Such an approach would not require much change in the FOMC’s decisionmaking process, but it also might not deliver much additional clarity about the Committee’s objectives and its plans for achieving them. Under the second approach, the statement would include an explicit numerical inflation objective.  An explicit inflation objective could help keep inflation expectations well anchor ed by increasing the public’s confidence that the Federal Reserve will keep inflation close to its objective and, thus,  could allow the Committee greater flexibility to put in place more stimulus in the near term.  To avoid the misperception that the FOMC was downweighting its statutory mandate to promote maximum employment, the statement also would summarize participants’ views about the longer- run sustainable rate of unemployment.  Participants’ estimates of the sustainable rate of unemployment could be drawn from the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), provided the Committee were willing to interpret its long-term projections in that way; the inflation objective also could be taken from the SEP, or the Committee could periodically vote on its inflation goal.

136,20101103,"exchanging ideas.  But, clearly, there’s also the possibi lity that some of these folks could profit from information gained in talking to Federal Reserve principal s or staff, and I think there’s considerable risk to us if it turns out that someone improperly used that information.  I think we would all agree tha t it’s important to manage these two matters appropriately, and I ’d like to propose that we create a small subcommittee, consisting of Presidents and Governors, to look at these issues, to talk to people, and to try to come up with some guidelines to help us address them .  Janet Yellen has agreed to chair the subcommittee. The third issue I mentioned at the videoconference is a little more squishy —it may be more a matter of preference and operating procedure than security per se.  It’s the tendency for peop le to take very strong, very inflexible positions on policy matters prior to the meetings at which those decisions will be made .  It’s  a longstanding tradition at the FOMC to try to maintain at least some plausible deniability in order to have a reason for a meeting —ot herwise, we could just do notation votes and save all the travel expenses.  Now, this may or may not be a fixable issue.  It may be a function of the difficult circumstances that we are currently involved in.  But I wanted to put that on the t able as well.  We circulated Michelle’s memo  describing the protocol for public statements, which is given to all new members of the FOMC.  I ’d be interested in your views on the substance as well as on whether it would make sense to have Janet’s sub committee look at this issue as well, perhaps as a project that’ s separate from the first two.  Again, it’s possible that nothing much can be done about it, but maybe we could come together and find some basis for a more cooperative solution than what we currently have. As I said, I don’t want to spend too much of the Committee’s time on these  issues —no more than 45 minutes or so —and I don’t want to do a full go -round, as there ’s no need for that.  But I certainly would be happy to have some comments on the issues, on the subcommittee, on November 2–3, 20104 of 238the charge of the subcommittee, or anything else people would like to talk about.  Janet, did you want to introduce that? MS. YELLEN.  Yes.  Thanks, Ben.  Let me just say that I share your concerns.  I think we’ve come in for a lot of criticism of our external communications —we’re getting low grades, and they ’re not entirely undeserved.  I personally see them as damaging our credibility and our reputation at a time when the institution is under enormous scrutiny, and we can ill afford it. I think the first issue that you raised on communication should be a no-brainer.  We’re obliged to maintain the confidentiality of FOMC information —period, full stop.  And that includes documents that we look at in the FOMC and information on who said what.  It ’s obvious that these guidelines have been breached.  I a lso know from personal experience over the years that it ’s easy for this to happen —it can happen pretty innocently when an experienced reporter lures one into revealing things that end up crossing the line.  But I ’m assuming it should be completely noncontroversial that we all need to be more careful and to abide by the Program for Security of FOM C Information.  So I think it’s not going to take long for our subcommittee to look at that —at least I hope not. The second issue you raised is more subtle, and it is an important one for the subcommittee to take up:  How do we ensure that our conversations with market participants and outside consultants don’t create the impression, and even the  reality, that well-connected outsiders have access to inside information?  I myself sometimes talk to market participants, and I do value those discussions, but I think we are placing ourselves at risk.  I think the guidelines that Michelle prepared and circulated are a terrific starting point, but maybe we need to go further, and I look forward to hearing your ideas on this. November 2–3, 20105 of 238Regarding the third issue —voicing policy views prior to meetings —I believe it’s a long-standing tradition of the Committee to refrain from publicly articulating firm positions on the stance that a member is going to take on future monetary policy moves.  In some ways,  I think following this tradition was easier and more straightforward when we were doing conventional policy.  We just had to be aware that we should refrain from speculating about future moves on the federal funds rate or indicating any firm view of our own.  I recognize that,  now that we ’ve hit the zero bound, the options are a lot more complicated, so it seems natural to weigh in on what kinds of tactics we could or couldn’t support.   But, frankly, I think many of the comments we ’ve made are destructive of collegial ity and of the Committee process —they do come close to feeling like a situation where we walk into the room having said, in effect, that it doesn’t matter what arguments or evidence one of us around the table musters, because our minds are made up. I think it does more than undermine collegiality.  I think we ’ve been generating a great deal of noise and market volatility.  That ’s something we ’ve consciously tried to avoid in the past.  It ’s not that we ’re not entitled to independent views —I think we absolutely are, and we have a right to express them.  I ’ve always been a firm believer in the notion that it’s important for us to walk in here with independent views, because it helps us avoid groupthink, which is a huge danger, and because it enriches the debate.  But when the Committee actually makes a policy decision, I feel that, when we make public remarks, we all have an obligation to state clearly what the policy is and what the rationale for it is, even if we might think or want to say individually that we have some qualms about it or some disagreement  with it.  One way to strengthen the voice of the Committee t hat we’ve discussed a bit would be for the Chairman to speak about policy more frequently and, perhaps,  at critical moments,  such November 2–3, 20106 of 238"
137,20101214,"extending and expanding tax cuts.  This proposal was seen by many market participants as providing a significant boost to GDP growth in 2011 and hence as reducing the need for additional asset purchases beyond the amount already announced.  Indeed, a follow-up survey of the primary dealers that the Desk conducted late last week indicated that the median expectation of asset purchases had fallen to $600 billion (the last column).  In addition, market participants believe that the unanticipated components of the new tax agreement could add between $100 and $300 billion to Treasury debt issuance over the next year, further increasing the amount of Treasury debt that needs to be held by private investors.  Overall, the increase in supply appears to have boosted the term premium embedded in longer-term yields.     As noted earlier, the increase in longer-term Treasury yields has also been driven by a reassessment of the likely path of short-term interest rates.  Market participants generally revised up their forecasts for GDP growth next year in response to the incoming economic data and the tax proposal.  Accordingly, as shown in the middle right panel, investors brought forward the expected timing of monetary policy tightening, with the implied policy path from federal funds and Eurodollar futures rates now reaching 50 basis points in the first half of 2012. With these developments, the interest rate environment has changed substantially.  Ahead of the November meeting, many market participants thought that the Federal Reserve’s ongoing presence in the market and the sluggish nature of the economic recovery would ensure a stable and low interest rate environment across the yield curve.  That view provided comfort to those establishing long positions in the market and likely contributed to the observed decline in the term premium.  However, the downward revision in the expected size of asset purchases and the improvement in the economic outlook have shaken that view, causing investors to adjust their positions abruptly at a time when the approaching year-end may have limited market liquidity.  These dynamics contributed to choppy trading conditions and sizable movements in longer-term interest rates.  The anticipated volatility of longer-term rates going forward, shown in the bottom left panel, moved up sharply, reflecting this shift in the rate environment. The improvement in the economic outlook and the shift in LSAP expectations also influenced broader financial conditions, as shown in the table in the bottom right panel.  Equity prices moved up further over the intermeeting period, presumably because the more favorable economic outlook was sufficient to offset any negative effects arising from higher interest rates.  Corporate bond spreads narrowed slightly since the last FOMC meeting, while the broad dollar index appreciated modestly.  All of these measures remain more accommodative than they were back in August, as the sizable changes that were realized ahead of the November FOMC meeting were sustained or only partly reversed. In addition to the movements in U.S. rates, an important focus in financial markets in recent weeks has been the situation in the European periphery, the subject December 14, 20104 of 127of the second exhibit.  Nathan Sheets will cover many of the European developments in detail, but I will go ahead and describe some of the related developments in financial markets.       As you know, Ireland, the EU, and the IMF agreed to a support package for Ireland intended to provide capital to their financial system and to cover sovereign debt liabilities for the next two to three years.  However, market attention quickly turned to conditions in other countries, including Portugal, Spain, and Italy.  The particular situations facing these countries differ importantly, but in each case the markets are asking the same question —whether the combination of sovereign debt and financial sector liabilities for that country is on a sustainable track.  In addition, market participants have increasingly noted that the backstop mechanisms put in place to date, including the European Financial Stability Facility, may prove insufficient to address pressures in some of these countries, given the volume of their debt outstanding. In response, sovereign debt spreads in these countries relative to German yields moved up sharply, as shown in the upper left panel, and the CDS spreads of the largest financial firms in those countries widened, as shown to the right.  Sovereign spreads have retraced some of their widening of late, helped in part by a faster pace of sovereign debt purchases by the ECB in particular markets.  However, debt spreads across these countries remain elevated, and the market seems quite vulnerable to further negative surprises. The concerns about the debt situation in these countries led to some pressure on euro-denominated assets more broadly.  European equity prices have underperformed U.S. share prices in recent months, as shown in the middle left panel, and the euro depreciated sharply against the dollar, as shown to the right.  In addition, option prices suggest that market participants are now placing higher odds on the possibility of sizable euro depreciation over the next year. An area of particular concern is the funding situation for banking firms in the European periphery.  Some of those firms already rely heavily on the ECB for euro-denominated funding.  In addition, signs are emerging that dollar-denominated funding for those firms is becoming strained. Indeed, U.S. money market funds are increasingly pulling back from providing dollar funding to major financial firms in peripheral countries, similar to the pattern that had taken place in the spring.  According to a confidential survey conducted by ICI, reported in the bottom lef t panel, money market funds’ holdings of Spanish bank liabilities have declined sharply over the past month, and the holdings of Italian assets are also now falling notably.  These data are consistent with anecdotal reports about money market funds not rolling over their exposures in these countries. Dollar funding pressures have not spread to financial firms more broadly, as indicated by the stability of the spot LIBOR spread to OIS, shown in the bottom right December 14, 20105 of 127panel.  However, European institutions that rely on currency swaps to raise dollar funding have faced higher borrowing rates, as shown by the swap-implied rate for the EURIBOR panel.  Moreover, some market participants have argued that funding pressures could have already spread more broadly if it were not for the presence of the central bank liquidity swap lines that the Federal Reserve has in place with the ECB and four other central banks.  They argue that the presence of these lines serves as an important backstop that has helped maintain the flow of dollar funding from private sources.     Before leaving this exhibit, let me discuss the proposal on the liquidity swap lines that Nathan Sheets and I described in a memo that was circulated to the Committee ahead of the meeting.  The liquidity swap lines that are currently in place with the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan, the Bank of England, the Swiss National Bank, and the Bank of Canada are scheduled to expire at the end of January.  Given the unsettled conditions in funding markets and the uncertainty about how stresses in European financial markets could unfold, our central bank counterparties have expressed interest in extending the liquidity swap lines. As indicated in our memo, Federal Reserve staff recommends that the Committee approve an extension of these swap lines for six months, which would bring their expiration date to August 1, 2011.  All aspects of the swap arrangements other than the expiration date would remain unchanged, including the expected pricing of any dollar funding operations at 100 basis points above the OIS rate.  This pricing should ensure that funding from the lines is attractive to financial institutions only during times of severe market stress.  We will be asking for a vote on this decision after the conclusion of my remarks.  If the Committee were to vote affirmatively, the five foreign central banks would take corresponding actions over the next several days, and the extension could be publicly announced soon thereafter. Your final exhibit focuses on the asset purchases for the SOMA portfolio.  As of last Friday, the Desk had conducted $75 billion of purchases out of the $600 billion expansion of the portfolio that was announced in November and an additional $31 billion of purchases associated with the reinvestment of principal payments on agency debt and mortgage- backed securities over the same period.  The Desk’s purchases have followed the maturity distribution shown in the upper left panel, resulting in an average duration of 5.5 years for the securities obtained, as planned. The operations have gone very well.  Participation by dealers has been strong, with an average offer- to-cover ratio of nearly 4, and the distribution of securities accepted has been fairly wide.  As expected, we have purchased a decent amount of securities that have been recently issued but that are not on-the-run issues.  In addition, we have purchased some older securities for which the 35 percent limit on SOMA holdings would have otherwise been binding.  At this point, 24 issues have moved through that threshold, and our holdings of some of those issues are now approaching 50 percent.  The Desk intends to place additional limits on the extent to December 14, 20106 of 127"
138,20110126,"Transcript of the Federal Open Market Committee Meeting on  January 25–26, 2011 January 25—Afternoon Session  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  We will come to order.  The new  members of the Committee  this year are  Presidents Evans, Fisher, Kocherlakota, and Plosser.  First Vice President Moore is once again serving for San Francisco.   Is First Vice President Pat Barron here?  MR. BARRON.  Yes.  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  This is Pat’s last meeting, because he’s retiring.  Let me congratulate you and thank you for your service in Atlanta.  [Applause] MR. BARRON.  Thank you. CHAIRMAN BERNANK E.  This is our organizational meeting, so we have our usual items.  The first item is electing Committee officers.  Governor Yellen, do you have a motion? MS. YELLEN.  I  would like to move the nomination of Ben Bernanke as Chairman. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  And I would like it to be known that I meet the residency requirement.  [Laughter]   Are there o ther nominations?  [No response ]  In f avor?  [Chorus of ayes]  Opposed?  [ No response ]  Thank you.  Governor Yellen. MS. YELLEN.  I would like to nominate Bill Dudley as Vice C hair. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Comments?  Other nominations?  All in  favor?   [Chorus of ayes]  Opposed?  [No response]  Thank you.  All right, w e now turn to the nominated staff officers of t he Committee.  Debbie will read the list.  MS. DANKER.  Secretary and Economist, William English; D eputy Secretary, Deborah Danker; Assistant Secretaries, Matthew Luecke, Dav id Skidmore, and Michelle Sm ith; General January 25–26, 20114 of 282Counsel, Scott Alva rez; Deputy General Counsel, Thomas Baxter; Assistant General Counsel, Richard Ashton; Economists, Nathan Sheets and David Stockton; Associate Economists from the Board, James Clouse, Thomas Connors, Steven Kamin, David Reifschneider, and David Wilcox ; Associate Economists from the Reserve B anks, Simon Potter, Loretta Mester, Daniel Sullivan, Harvey Rosenblum, and Kei-Mu Yi . CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Other nominations?  [No response]  It’s a very good group.  All in favor?  [Chorus of ayes]  Opposed?  [No response]  Thank you.  Next w e have to select a Reserve Bank  to execute transactions for the Open M arket Account.  New York once again is willing to serve.  Any other nominations?  [No response]  All in favor?  [Chorus of ayes]  Opposed?  [No response]  Thank you. The manager of the System Open Market Account , Brian Sack , is once again willing to serve.  The New York Bank will have to ratify that if he is elected.  Other nominations?  [No response]  In f avor?   [Chorus of ayes]  Any opposed?  [No response]  Tha nk you.  The next i tem is the proposed revisions to the P rogram for S ecurity of FOMC Information .  This is the memorandum that was circulated to you from Scott and Debbie.  It makes two changes to the current P rogram for S ecurity .  The most important change sets out a process for investigating breaches of FOMC security that involves an  evaluation by the General Counsel and the Secretary  in the first round, and then, if a second round is necessary, the Inspector General of the Board has agreed to investigate.   Just for clarity, my sense is that we are trying to address breaches  related to  the discussion of materials prepared for the meeting, such as the agenda, memos, briefings, and other sorts of things that are part of the background for the meeting , as well  as descriptions of what happened at the meeting, characterizations of other people’s comments, and so on.  What we do not intend to address here is the expression of your January 25–26, 20115 of 282own views, your own policy assessments, and so on.  So we’re trying to keep the meet ing itself separate and not disclose the items I mentioned . Regarding t he second change, the Chairman already has authority to make special exceptions for disclosure of information , and, obviously , there are legitimate reasons  for this .  The change now spe cifies  that, in doing so, the Chairman should inform the Committee when those exceptions are made.   I would like to note that there are some routine, minor, administrative cases , such as allowing a noncitizen staff member to participate in producing the minutes or assigning the work to a transcriber who works with the tapes.  Of course, I will inform you of things like that if you so desire, but I hope that such minor administrative  matters of that sort will be ex cepted.  This memorandum was circulated, and there  were no comments.  I’d like to open the floor for some brief comments now, and I hope that we can vote on it as part of the organizational section of this meeting.  However, if the Committee feels that a more lengthy discussion is necessary, we do ha ve a longer  period of time tomorrow on communications, so, if necessary, we can defer it until then .  Would anyone like to comment on the memorandum? MR. TARULLO .  May  I ask a question about it, Mr. Chairman? CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Yes, Governor Tarullo. MR. TARULLO .  Janet, could you give a little more context for the kinds of information that the subcommittee had in mind in thinking about the need for a better, more stringent process?   I am thinking of this more as a lawyer rather than  as a member of the FOM C, so I think it would be helpful to make sure that everybody understands what actually is being proscribed and why it’s being proscribed.  For example, t here’s a lot of information in the Tealbook every six weeks, and  I don’t think any of us think that  information needs to get Class I confidentiality January 25–26, 20116 of 282"
139,20110315,"As shown in the upper-left panel of your first exhibit, the spread of political unrest across the MENA region resulted in a sizable spike in oil prices, as investors reacted to the disruption to oil supply from the region.  Oil prices ended the period more than 15 percent  higher than they were at the time of the last FOMC meeting.  Nathan Sheets will provide a more detailed di scussion of these developments; I will instead concentrate on their implications for U.S. interest rates and asset prices.    The primary effect of these events on U.S. asset prices has been to raise concerns about growth prospects.  Indeed, on the days of the five largest increases in oil prices over the intermeeting period, which were all associated with key geopolitical developments, equity prices fell a cumulative 4 percent, and the 10- year Treasury yield declined nearly 15 basis points.  However, the concerns about economic growth arising from higher energy prices were counterbalanced by the incoming economic data over the intermeeting period.  As noted earlier, economic data releases have generally come in stronger than investors’ expectations, as suggested by the economic news index shown to the right.  On balance, the combination of energy price developments and the incoming data appears to have left investors’ views on U.S. growth prospects about unchanged. Given that assessment, there was little revision to the expected path of the federal funds rate, as shown in the middle-left panel.  At shorter horizons, these expectations appear firmly anchored by the “extended period” language in the FOMC statement.  Moreover, the Chairman’s semiannual monetary policy testimony and speeches by other FOMC members were read by market participants as emphasizing a commitment to the current stance of monetary policy, further anchoring expectations at those horizons.  At longer horizons, policy expectations have been responsive to incoming information but ended the intermeeting period only slightly higher. The small upward shift in policy expectations at longer horizons showed through to changes in Treasury yields.  As shown in the middle-right panel, Treasury coupon yields ended the period modestly higher than their levels at the time of the last FOMC meeting.  Of course, the recent surge in energy prices also has consequences for the inflation outlook priced into financial markets.  This surge is taking place against th e backdrop of the significant gains in broader commodity prices that has occurred since last summer.  Accordingly, it may be particularly important at this time to monitor measures of inflation expectations.  As shown in the bottom-left panel, the five- year breakeven inflation rate derived from TIPS rose sharply over the intermeeting period, extending the strong upward trend that has been in place since last August.  This trend reflects an upward revision to the intermediate -term inflation outlook that has been driven by growing confidence in a cyclical recovery, evidence that core inflation rates have bottomed out, and the substantial r ise in energy and food prices. March 15, 20114 of 165In contrast, the five -year, five -year forward breakeven inflation rate has stabilized in recent months at levels that are within its historical range.  Thus, according to this measure, the factors that are boosting the inflation outlook over the intermediate term are not leading to significant longer-run inflation concerns among investors.  Survey s of market participants also do not show a significant shift in perceptions of longer-term inflation, though the most recent survey reading of inflation expectations among households showed an unexpected increase, as Dave Stockton will discuss.  The panel to the right takes a closer look at the intermeeting increase in the five -year breakeven inflation rate by decomposing it into the changes in the implied one-year breakeven inflation rates at various horizons.  As can be seen, the increase in the five-year rate was driven primarily  by a very steep rise in the breakeven inflation rate over the next year.  This increase in large part reflects the direct effects of higher food and energy prices on headline CPI.  In contrast, the rise in breakeven inflation rat es at horizons several years ahead has been limited, suggesting that little of the anticipated spike in headline inflation is expected to pass through to inflation over the intermediate term.  The effects from energy prices and economic data were also appar ent in other asset prices —the subject of your second exhibit.  Broad equity indexes finished the intermeeting period about flat, on balance, despite several downdrafts associated with developments in the MENA region.  In recent days, the market has also had to digest the news of the earthquake and tsunami in northeastern Japan and the resulting problems at their nuclear plants.  Those events initially resulted in only a modest pullback from risk in U.S. financial markets, but, unfortunately, the situation in Japan has continued to deteriorate.  A further response in U.S. financial markets is expected today following the dramatic plunge in Japanese share prices that occurred overnight.  Overall, the developments in the Middle East and Japan have left investor s with a perception of greater downside risks to the outlook. Of course, the broader story in equity markets has been the robust rally since last August, with the S&P index having gained about 25 percent over that period.  The staff continues to believe th at this rally was reasonable from the perspective of the fundamentals.  In particular, the increase in share prices has been driven by a revision to expected earnings growth as economic prospects have improved.  While the increase has also been supported by a decline in the equity risk premium, the staff’s measure of this premium still remains sizable, as shown to the right.  The more favorable sentiment towards risk since last August has also been reflected in credit markets, but the story in this area is s omewhat more complicated.  As reviewed in the staff memo on asset valuations, some developments in credit markets bear watching at this point.  The areas that are drawing the most attention in this regard are the corporate bond and leveraged loan markets.  Pricing in these two markets has become more aggressive, as shown in the middle- left panel, and the terms of many transactions have loosened, as investors become more willing to assume risk.  Nevertheless, most March 15, 20115 of 165valuation models indicate that pricing is not excessive at this point, and the terms of most deals are still closer to those seen in the first half of the 2000s than those of the bubble years.  In any case, we will continue to watch these markets closely, as there is now less room for the current trends to continue before we reach a worrisome point. Another credit market segment that has attracted some attention is commercial mortgage-backed securities.  Sentiment towards this sector has improved further over the past several months.  This shift is reflected in the ongoing narrowing of credit spreads on these securities and the pickup in the flow of new CMBS deals.  As shown to the right, most dealers expect issuance to reach about $40 billion this year.  Moreover, anecdotal evidence suggests that many  investment banks are investing in their CMBS desks—a further indication that they expect activity to continue to improve.  While some observers have raised concerns about whether the pricing and terms of new deals are already getting too aggressive, most see this trend as appropriate and the asset class as still modestly cheap.  Overall, the staff’s assessment is that conditions in credit markets, while more aggressive in some areas, are not obviously out of line with fundamentals or historical norms.  To a large extent, loosening credit conditions have been driven by investors’ assessment that the prospects for economic growth are improving. In foreign exchange markets, the dollar continued to weaken against other major currencies over the intermeeting period, as shown in the bottom-left panel.  This move in part reflects that monetary policy prospects in several advanced economies have shifted more aggressively in the direction of tightening than those in the United States.  Indeed, the market now believes that an increase in the policy rate by the ECB is imminent and that the Bank of England will follow suit soon thereafter.  Reflecting those expectations, two -year sovereign yields in those countries have moved up to a greater extent than domestic Treasury yields in recent months, as shown to the right.  For the ECB, the shift in the policy outlook has taken place despite ongoing strains in  peripheral countries.  The announcement over the past weekend of pending changes to the European Financial Stability Facility  prompted some narrowing of peripheral sovereign debt spreads, but they still remain quite wide.  Your third exhibit turns to monetary policy operations.  As of last Friday, the Desk had completed $310 billion of the $600 billion of intended asset purchases announced in the November FOMC statement, bringing the total amount of domestic assets held in the SOMA to $2.3 trillion, as shown in the upper- left panel.  Our purchases for portfolio expansion are currently running at a pace of $80 billion per month, which puts our asset holdings on a straight trajectory to around $2.6 trillion by the end of June.  In addition, the Desk continues to conduct purchases associated with the reinvestment of principal payments on our holdings of agency debt and mortgage-backed securities.  Those reinvestments will total about $22 billion over the next month, but we expect them to decline in subsequent months.  The monthly flow of total purchases from the program is shown in the upper- right panel.  The figure also includes the projection of purchases through September under March 15, 20116 of 165"
140,20110427,"This policy outlook appears to be based on investors’ expectations for a sustained economic recovery and some ongoing concerns about inflation.  Investors saw the incoming economic data as weaker than expected, leading them to reduce their first -half economic growth estimates notably, but they apparently did not substantially lower their forecasts for growth further ahead.  At the same time, some of the factors that have contributed to investors’ concerns about inflation intensified, as energy and commodity prices continued their steep climb, as shown in the upper- right panel.  The rise in energy and commodity prices put some upward pressure on near- term breakeven inflation rates.  More importantly, measures of the five -year, five -year forward breakeven inflation rate also moved higher.  This recent increase leaves the Board measure near the levels observed over much of 2009 and 2010 but pushes the Barclays measure slightly above its historical range.  The increase in breakeven  inflation rates was associated with a modest rise in nominal Treasury yields over the intermeeting period, as shown to the right. A notable development in the Treasury market over the intermeeting period was the announcement that Standard and Poor’s had revised its outlook for the long- term credit rating of the United States from stable to negative.  Not surprisingly, market participants were already focused on the budgetary imbalances facing the United States and the uncertainty about whether the political process will produce an agreement to address those imbalances.  The S&P announcement prompted an immediate rise in Treasury yields, as summarized in the bottom-left panel, but the effect did not persist, as investors saw the report as conveying little new information. The fiscal difficulties facing the United States will remain at the forefront with the looming debt ceiling problem.  As shown in the panel to the right, the amount of outstanding Treasury debt is projected to reach its s tatutory limit on or  around May 16.  At that time, the Treasury would begin to employ a set of extraordinary measures that allow it to temporarily finance the government without increasing the level of debt subject to the ceiling.  Our estimate is that such measures would allow the Treasury to operate until mid -July.  Yields on Treasury bills maturing around these dates suggest that investors do not expect a significant market disruption from the debt ceiling despite the uncertainties surrounding this process. Your next exhibit turns to some of the international developments that affected financial markets over the intermeeting period.  Japanese equity prices fell dramatically following the earthquake on March 11 and the nuclear problems that ensued, as shown in the upper- left panel.  While share prices have bounced back some, the Nikkei index is still about 7 percent lower than its levels ahead of the earthquake, reflecting concerns about the economic consequences of those events.  Despite these economic concerns, the yen stren gthened sharply in the immediate aftermath of the earthquake, as shown to the right.  This pattern was likely due to some unwinding of yen carry trades as global asset prices declined as well as the anticipation of repatriation flows from insurers and retail investo rs. April 26–27, 20114 of 244In response to the movement in the yen, the G-7 authorities announced their intention to conduct a coordinated currency intervention on March 18.  As summarized in the memo that was sent to the Committee at that time, operations were conducted by each central bank that day during their respective trading hours.  In carrying out our operations, the Desk conducted two rounds of yen sales, with each involving $500 million of transactions.  Following the usual procedure, half of the funds for the intervention came from the System Open Market Account and the other half from the Treasury’s Exchange Stabilization Fund, with the SOMA transactions authorized by the Foreign Currency Subcommittee of the FOMC.  Overall, the operations were carried out relatively quickly, with no operational difficulties. Notable developments in financial markets also took place in the euro area.  As Nathan Sheets will discuss in his briefing, the Portuguese government requested financial support from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund, making it the third peripheral European country to do so.  More recently, market participants have become increasingly concerned about the possibility of a restructuring of Greek sovereign debt.  These developments led to a surge in the yield spreads on the sovereign debt from these two countries, as shown in the middle- left panel.  Importantly, there has been only limited pass-through from these developments to the pricing of Spanish and Italian debt, although some modest spillover effects have been visible at times.  Despite the ongoing problems in peripheral countries, the incoming data on economic activity for the euro area as a whole has been relatively strong, and headline inflation has been elevated.  In response, the European Central Bank raised its benchmark policy rate by 25 basis points at its April 7 meeting, and several additional policy actions are expected by year-end.  The realized and prospective policy tightening supported the euro, which gained 4 percent against the dollar, shown in the middle- right panel.  More broadly, the dollar depreciated against all major currencies except the Japanese yen, leaving the broad dollar index more than 2 percent lower over the intermeeting period. The potential risks from the various domestic and global developments and the softer tone of the economic data did not manage to hold back U.S. equity prices.  As shown in the bottom-left panel, the S&P 500 index gained more than 3 percent over the intermeeting period.  Equity prices had fallen sharply around the time of the last FOMC meeting, in part reflecting greater perceived uncertainty in the aftermath of the Japanese earthquake.  But investors’ uncertainty about the outlook has since diminished, as shown by the VIX index in the panel  to the right.  Returning to the bottom-left panel, one notable exception to the rally in equities has been the financial sector.  Although bank earnings for the first quarter have generally met or exceeded analysts’ expectations, profit growth has be en driven in large part by reductions in loan loss provisions.  Investors have increasingly worried about the sources of ongoing earnings growth for these firms, leading to downward pressure on their share prices.  April 26–27, 20115 of 244Your third exhibit turns to monetary policy operations.  As of today, the Desk will have completed $422 billion of the $600 billion of intended Treasury purchases, in addition to the ongoing reinvestment of principal payments from our agency debt and mortgage-backed securities.  Overall, the total pace of the Desk’s purchases has been running at around $100 billion per month, as shown in the upper- left panel.  If the FOMC were to complete the $600 billion in asset purchases in June and maintain the reinvestment policy thereafter, as assumed in the Tealbook, the Desk’s purchases would decline to an average pace of about $10 billion per month over the second half of the year.  The panel to the right shows the projected characteristics of the SOMA portfolio as of the end of June under the Tealbook policy assumptions and compares them with  the SOMA portfolio at the time of the April 2010 FOMC meeting, when the Committee last had an extensive discussion of its exit strategy.  The most notable changes to the portfolio over this period are the expansion of i ts size as a result of the $600 billion asset purchase program, and the rotation of its composition from agency debt and agency MBS to Treasury securities as a result of the reinvestment policy.  The effective duration of the portfolio has increased slightly over this period and remains well above its historical levels of two  to three years.  As Bill Nelson will discuss in his briefing on exit strategy, the Committee may want to renormalize the balance sheet as part of its efforts to remove the current degree of monetary policy accommodation.  The policy discussion that occurred last April suggested that Committee members were inclined to eventually sell the agency MBS held in the SOMA portfolio as part of that process.  Accordingly, the recent decision by the Treasury to sell its agency MBS holdings may be of particular interest to the Committee.  The Treasury indicated that it would sell all of its agency MBS holdings, totaling $142 billion, at a pace of up to $10 billion per month, depending on market conditions. Overall, the market has effectively absorbed the Treasury’s operations to date.  As shown in the middle-left panel, MBS spreads widened on the announcement, particularly in the higher coupon securities for which sales were seen as potentially more d isruptive to the market.  However, as sales got under way and were met with strong demand, those concerns diminished, and MBS spreads retraced.  Treasury yields also experienced some mild upward pressure from the announcement.  However, consistent with the staff’s calibration of portfolio balance effects, this response was small because of the limited size of the Treasury’s portfolio.  A decision by the FOMC to sell its MBS holdings could be more consequential for market pricing and market functioning, give n the much larger size of the Federal Reserve’s holdings, highlighted in the middle-right panel. The bottom panels of the exhibit turn to the effects of the change to the FDIC’s deposit insurance assessment system that was implemented on April 1.  This change has implications for the behavior of the federal funds rate and other overnight market interest rates relative to the interest rate that the Federal Reserve pays on reserve balances (the IOER rate).  In general, overnight market rates tend to remain relatively April 26–27, 20116 of 244"
141,20110622,"Transcript of the Federal Open Market Committee Meeting on  June 21–22, 2011  June 21 Session  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Good morning, everybody.  Because t his is a joint FOMC –Board meeting, I need a motion to close the mee ting. MS. YELLEN .  So moved. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  W e are starting very early, and I thank you for arranging your schedules that way.  We have an awful lot to accomplish today, and I would certainly like to get to the end of the economic go-round.  So let me just ask everyone, where possible, to be succinct and to be aware of the time. That being said, I would first like  to take a minute to note that, with high probability, this will be the last meeting for Dave Stockton before he ambles off into the sunset.  [Laughter]  Dave joined the Federal Reserve in 1981 as the inflation specialist in the section that was known as W ages, Prices, and Productivity.  That year, the CPI clocked in at about 10 percent.  [Laughter]   However, after ’81, of course, it began to come down very steadily.  A fter successfully bringing inflation under control, Dave rose rapidly through the ranks and was appointed division director in 2000.  In all, he has attended 170 FOMC meetings, including 84 as division director and FOMC economist.  At his first meeting back in November ’85, he delivered a lengthy presentation to Chairman Vol cker and the rest o f the Committee on the effect of dollar depreciation on the U.S. economy.  They must have liked it, because they invited him back almost immediately.   As far as the macroeconomics is concerned, perhaps it will suffice for today simply to note that Dave’s t ime as director included both the last years of the G reat Moderation and the period that I am confident will become known as the G reat Immoderation.  [Laughter]  Economic historians will puzzle for years over Dave’s role in all of that.  [Laughter]  June 21–22, 20114 of 282Dave h as given us the benefit of his keen insight as a macroeconomist, his unparalleled grasp of the inflation mechanism in the United States, and the hallmark of his time here, the wit and humility in which he has wrapped it all.  Never before has the owner of the staff forecast compared its  shelf life unfavorably to that of a jar of mayonnaise in the Mojave Desert.  [Laughter]   So, Dave, on behalf of the Board and the Committee, we want to thank you for a job exceedingly well done.  Thank you.  [Applause] Our first item today is our special topic on DSGE models, and I will call in just a moment on Michael Dotsey from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank.  He will be supported by Marco Del Negro from New York, Jeff Campbell from Chicago, and J. P. Laforte  from t he Board.   I really appreciated the summary memo and the background papers that we got ; a lot of care went into trying to make this intelligible and understandable to everybody.  And it was a great example of the collaborative effort between Board researchers and Reserve Bank researchers.   So let me turn to Michael.  MR. DOTSEY.1  Mr. Chairman and FOMC participants, good morning, and thank you for giving me the opportunity to introduce the S ystem’s DSGE project to you.  First, I would like to give you a brie f overview of dynamic stochastic general equilibrium, or DSGE, models and indicate how they can provide useful input into the policy process.  Then I will illustrate two uses of the models:  their ability to identify economic disturbances that are responsible for a given event—in our case, the Great Recession —and their use as a forecasting tool.  In my discussion, I will concentrate on the relative strengths of the methodology, but I will also make you aware of the pitfalls.  I will conclude by describing other uses of the models that the FOMC might be interested in.  Let me begin by reviewing the methodology employed in DSGE models.  Specifically , what are DSGE models , what makes them special , what are their strengths and weaknesses, and how should they be used in conjunction with the other tools available to policymakers ? As summarized in exhibit 1, DSGE models are small to medium- sized economic models.  Thus, they are much smaller than FRB/US but generally larger than simple time-series models such as vector autoregressions.  Notably, DSGE models are also                                                  1 The materials used by Mr. Dotsey are appended to this transcript (appendix 1).  June 21–22, 20115 of 282structural in nature, meaning that they specify the objectives and constraints of each decisionmaker in the model.  This feature implies that the shocks in the models can be given an economic interpretation, and that the models can be used to analyze policy changes.  The decisionmakers in the models include a private sector composed of households and firms, as well as a public sector made up of a fiscal authority and a central bank.  The private agen ts in the model solve explicit optimization problems , and expectations of future economic conditions are central determinants of their behavior.  A distinguishing feature of the DSGE methodology is that these expectations of future economic conditions are endogenous.  This means that households and firms incorporate expectations of future policy into their current decisions.  This is an especially important feature when examining the effects of alternative policies or discussing the effects  of anticipated policy changes.  As their name implies, DSGE models are general -equilibrium models, implying that prices, interest rates, and wages adjust so that supply equals demand in all markets at any given point in time.  In addition, the models are stochastic, and economic fluctuations are generated by shocks.  For example, changes in productivity, unanticipated changes in monetary policy, and changes in the efficiency of financial intermediation are factors that influence the behavior of the model economies.  The shocks capture the inherent unpredic tability of macroeconomic data.  The parameters of the model are usually estimated using Bayesian statistical techniques.  The statistical methodology allows the user to characterize the uncertainty surrounding the parameter estimates and the economic forecasts that are produced by the model, as well as the uncertainty surrounding the results of alternative policy experiments.   DSGE models have become an extensive research topic at many central banks because the use of an explicit optimizing model makes the output of DSGE models—whether that output is an economic forecast, the results of a policy experiment, or the analysis of the sources of economic fluctuations— readily interpretable in terms of economic theory.  Thus, DSGE models can address a host of issues that are relevant to policymakers. Let me now go into a bit more depth concerning the basic building blocks of the models, which are summarized in exhibit 2 in the handout.  First, the models have a production side.  Firms employ workers and rent capital in order to produce goods, and production is subject to productivity shocks.  Firms also have pricing power , and prices adjust slowly.  These price rigidities are an important feature of the models and an important element in aligning the models with the data.  The pricing mechanism generates a Phillips curve that relates inflation to a measure of economic activity.  Along with productivity shocks, firms’ decisions are directly influenced by shocks to the markup of price over marginal cost. The second major participants in the model are households.  They own the firms and the capital stock either directly or indirectly through their ownership of financial intermediaries.  They choose how much to consume and save as well as how much June 21–22, 20116 of 282"

Then I’ll turn briefly to Mike Foley to update us on banking developments and any questions we’ve been getting on supervisory issues.   Those are some preliminary briefings to update everybody.  Questions will be allowed, of course, at any stage.   After the bri efings we’ll turn to Bill English, who , with the assistance of Brian Sack , will discuss some of the issues raised by their joint memo of a few weeks ago about potential actions that the Federal Reserve could take.  Noting that everything is not signed, sealed, and delivered  and noting that there are certainly many stresses in financial markets, I think it would still be useful for us to get at least a little bit of input about what kinds of actions the Fed might consider taking under certain contingencies.  Particularly given that we have no immediate action proposed, I don’t plan to ask for any votes today.  But again, your input is useful to  help think about what we might bring to this Committee in the future. So that’s my proposal.  Are there any suggestions or concerns about what else we might talk about?  [No response]  All right.  Seeing none, let me begin our briefing process and turn to Linda Robertson to give us a brief update on yesterday’s negotiations and on where it goes from here.  Linda. MS. RO BERTSON.  Great.  I think it’s appropriate to start exactly where the President started last night.  That is, although there’s an agreement in principle and legislative language now embod ies that framework, there are still some critical votes to take place before any of the celebration or a sigh of relief is fully realized.  I’ll come back to the floor situations in a minute .  Where I’d like to start is with the framework, and in particular, the mechanics of this agreement, for which there are several import ant milestones that I think are going to be important in terms of overall thought about where things are heading on fiscal policy.  As far as the mechanics  goes, I did want to take note briefly about how the various leaders were portraying this.  In the document that the speaker put out last night, he basically outlined three accomplishments from his standpoint:  (1) it cuts government spending more than it increases the debt limit, (2) it implements spending caps to restrain future spending, August 1, 20114 of 53and (3) it advances the cause of a balanced budget amendment.   Meanwhile, Majority Leader Reid put out a remarkably similar document today, but his touchstones were  (1) it extended the debt ceiling up to 2013, removing the cloud of uncertainty over our economy, and (2) it makes a nearly $1 trillion down payment on deficit reductions.  So that’s how they’re framing this deliberation today—and hopeful ly it will be concluded today. Let me take a minute to explain the mechanics.  It’s a couple-stage process, with some interesting hallmarks ; for those of you who know the budget battles of the 1980s and into the 1990s, you’ll see some familiar mechanisms.  For  stage 1, there is an immediate -upon- passage $920 billion, roughly, deficit achievement embodied in caps on the discretionary spending accounts, and there are  a couple of important components to that.  In terms of the overall framework, it’s split between nondefense discretionary and defense .  There is a specific firewall between those two in FY2012 and FY2013 and then the firewall between those two comes down for the remainder of the 10-year period.  What does this mean in terms of overall fiscal reduction in 2012 and ’13?  Roughly $10 billion in spending cuts over that two- year period —$7 billion  and then $3 billion.  O f that , $5 billion comes from defense and what they’re calling security -related accounts, and the remainder from the nondefense discretionary.  With this first phase, which is automatic upon passage and is focused on the discretionary spending accounts, what happens in terms of the debt ceiling?  A two-step process there.   Immediately, the Treasury gets a $400 billion bump-up in the debt ceiling, which takes them into September of this year.  The President then—although I don’t know this for sure—would probably send a certification to the Congress, before they go out in August, attesting to certain levels of debt ceiling within their estimates for the end of the year.   The Congress then has, I believe, 50 days to disapprove of that certification.  And he has a veto.  And with that, the President then achieves another $500 billion on the debt ceiling.  In other words, the way they’re thinking about this first phase is that roughly $900 billion in debt cei ling is pretty much automatic.  What happens from there?  This is where we come to stage 2 and what one thinks about in terms of the overall components of this package.  When you look at the totals , you’ve got roughly $900 billion and change in the first phase—how do you get to the roughly $2.1 trillion to $2.3 trillion that everyone’s talking about?  T hat’s where stage 2 comes in.  A special committee is established , which would be composed of 12 m embers  of Congress, evenly split between parties and evenly split between the chambers.   They have until Thanksgiving, November 23, to report back to the leadership on an overall deficit reduction package of $1.5 trillion.  Then there’s a whole set of fast -track procedures in the Congress if, indeed , this super- special committee does achieve a majority —and it’s a majority vote only—on a package.  The Congress then has fast- track procedures in which th ey can vote on this by December  23. August 1, 20115 of 53So what could happen with that?  Well, t he committee could fail, in which case a whole process is then trigger ed; the committee could come up with something less than the $1.5 trillion; or they could meet their goal —in fact, the Congress then subsequently passes their package.  I f they report $1.5 trillion and the Congress passes it, then the debt ceiling goes up by that amount as well.  If they’re somewhere between $1.2 trillion and $1.5 trillion , then the debt ceiling is increased to whatever level that is.  If it’s anything less than $1.2 trillion or they fail to do anything whatsoever, then phase 3, which is sequestration, is triggered.  Before I turn to phase 3, what’s on the table in terms of this joint committee?  Really, everything.  It can be additional discretionary, it can be direct spending, it can be mandatory programs , it can be revenues.  A s I have read the summary documents today, it looks pretty much like however they want to configure it and can reach a majority vote around somewhere between $1.2 trillion and $1.5 trillion.   If they fail—and this is on a very short timeline, and in an intense political environment—then an automatic sequestration process is triggered, one very much like the old Gramm –Rudman–Hollings  provisions from the late 1980s and on into the ’90s.  But there is one other tripwire  before you get to sequestration, and that is that both chambers of the Congress are required to vote on a balanced budget amendment.  And by some miracle  that I don’t think will happen, if they were to vote and send the balanced budget amendment to the states, then none of this sequestration happens under that scenario.  Highly unlikely, but nonetheless in the package. So, sequestration.  This is where everyone has mutual tension to try to avoid this outcome.  That’s a sequestration of roughly $1.2 trillion, 50 percent of which will come from defense and the other from nondefense spending.  This package—and this is where a lot of the tension is today—is solely in the spending sphere.  There are no revenues contemplated under the sequestration , solely spending accounts.  So, 50 percent from defense.  If  that were to be triggered, they’re estimating that would be about $50 billion a year in defense spending, and the remainder would be made up elsewhere.   Now, there are some important safety net programs that are exempted:  Social Security, Medicaid, veterans ’ programs, and other essential services.  Medicare is included, but it’s capped at 2 percent, and maybe in the range of the provider cuts.  And that’s it.  What does all of this mean?  If you’re looking at this from the perspective of those who want to protect spending programs, they have the ability in the committee process to inject any additional revenues in that process.  The other thing that a lot of folks are pointing out is that all of this is scored off of the March CBO baseline, not the alternative baseline, which assumes an extension of the Bush tax cuts.  In other words, we’ve set into motion and into law a budget framework and a spending package that has no extension of the tax cuts after 2012.  So somehow, somewhere, if folks want to extend those tax cuts, they will have to create the environment and the spending and revenue tensions to do that.  And that’s no small amount.  If you look at the current services baseline, which is what this package is scored off of, revenues go to 20.8 percent of GDP by 2021.  On the other hand, with the assumption that the Bush tax cuts continue and the AMT f ix is agreed , the baseline would have gone to August 1, 20116 of 53"
143,20110809,"Transcript of the Federal Open Market Committee Meeting on  August 9 , 2011   CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Good morning, everybody.  This is a join t FOMC –Board meeting.  So I need a motion to close the meeting.  MS. YELLEN.  So moved. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you very much.  Before we get down to business, we have a few people to whom we have to say farewell —first, Carol Low.  Carol, an FOMC speciali st in the Secretariat, is retiring.  She’s worked at the Board for only 41 years, begun at age six.  [Laughter]  She has attended 222 FOMC meetings, which turns out to be the same number that  Don Kohn attended .  So that gives you a  measure— MR. WILCOX .  On e Don Kohn unit. [Laughter]  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  One Don Kohn unit.  That’s right.  So that’s quite a record.  Carol, you’ve been here for many, many years, and we thank you for your service.  [Applause] It was announced yesterday that Nathan Sheets will be leaving the Board to take a position in the private sector, and hence he recused himself from the last meeting and obviously has had nothing to do with this meeting as well.  I’m sorry he’s not here to accept our congratulations, but as you know, Nathan did a wonderful job piloting the Division of International Finance through some very choppy international waters over the past few  years, and we’re going to miss him and his insig hts and understanding of the international situation very much .  Steve Kamin will be acting director as we try to regroup in International Finance, and we appreciate Steve taking on that responsibility.  For the record, let me acknowledge our thanks to Nathan Sheets for his many contributions. August 9, 20114 of 162And finally, this is the last meeting for our colleague Tom Hoenig.  Tom began attending FOMC meeting s in 1991 and  has attended a total of 161 meetings, which exceeds the sum of any two other members around the table.  The only problem I’ve ever had with Tom is that I’m unable to get him to say what he really thinks.  [Laughter]  It’s a 20- year record of service through three recessions— I’m not implying any causality —and we have all benefited  very much, Tom, from your perspective, your banker’s insights, and your wide range of experience.  MR. HOENIG.  Thank you.  I will note to the Committee that I want to apologize.  I had no idea the markets were going to react this way to my leaving.  [Laughter]  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  W ell, we will have a chance to make jokes like that at a lunch in your honor after the next FOMC meeting, and I suspect that your retirement might get mentioned once or twice at Jackson Hole.  I’m just guessing. MR. HOENIG.  I would imagine. CHAIRMAN BERNAN KE.  All right.  Tom, thank you.  You have our great appreciation and admiration. MR. HOENIG.  Thank you.  [Applause] CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  Without further ado, let’s go to item 1 on our agenda and turn to Brian Sack for a report on financial developm ents.  Brian.  MR. SACK.1  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Over the intermeeting period, financial market participants became very concerned about the prospects for U.S. economic growth and had to contend with significant risk events related to the fiscal situations in Europe and the United States.  These developments led to dramatic declines in equity prices and interest rates, and they prompted widespread discussion about whether the Federal Reserve will deliver additional policy stimulus.  The increasing pessimism in the market about economic growth prospects was driven in part by the incoming economic data.  The data indicated that the economic recovery has been more anemic than had been appreciated, despite the degree of policy accommodation that the Federal Reserve has put in place, and raised questions                                                  1 The materials used by Mr. Sack are appended to this tran script (appendix 1).  August 9, 20115 of 162about the extent to which economic activity will pick up going forward.  Indeed, respondents to the Desk’s primary dealer survey revised down their GDP forecasts substantially, and most of them saw the risks around that lower forecast as skewed to the downside.  The dramatic movements in asset prices in recent days indicate that investors’ confidence in the economy recovery has deteriorated even further.  Based on this shift in the outlook, investors lowere d the expected path of the federal funds rate substantially, as shown in the upper- left panel  (exhibit 1) .  Current futures prices suggest that the federal funds rate will remain below 50 basis points through most of 2013.  A similar revision took place in the policy expectations from the Desk’s primary dealer survey.  As shown to the right, the perceived likelihood of the timing of the first increase in the federal funds rate target shifted back dramatically, with considerable odds now assigned to 2013. The revision to the economic growth outlook has also brought the possibility of additional policy accommodation back into the discussion among market participants.  The primary dealer survey asked about the likelihood of various policy steps that the Chairma n discussed in his June press conference.  As shown in the middle- left panel, many respondents placed meaningful odds on those steps over the next year.  In particular, changing the “extended period” language, providing guidance on the SOMA portfolio, increasing the size of SOMA, and increasing the duration of SOMA were all given about a 20 percent probability by the median respondent, while cutting IOER was given about a 10 percent probability.  The perceived chances of policy actions have likely shifted up notably since the time of the survey, given the deterioration in financial conditions over the past week. The revision to expectations for short- term interest rates and the possibility of additional balance sheet actions contributed to a notable decline in Treasury yields.  As shown in the middle-right panel, the 10-year Treasury yield fell about 60 basis points over the intermeeting period to around 2.35 percent . The decline in the 10- year yield was driven entirely by its real rate component, as shown in the bottom- left panel.  The 10- year real interest rate fell to around 15 basis points—a remarkably low level that reflects the high degree of pessimism among investors about the growth prospects for the economy.  At the same time, 10 -year breakeven inflation rates stayed relatively high, reflecting in part that inflation has remained elevated in this environment. The weaker economic growth outlook also caused an abrupt decline in equity prices.  As shown in the bottom-right panel, equity prices plunged over the past week or two, bringing the S&P 500 index about 14 percent lower since the last FOMC meeting.  Other risk assets also suffered, with high-yield corporate bond spreads widening notably and bank share prices falling sharply.  The share prices of Bank of America and Citigroup are down nearly 40 percent and 30 percent, respectively, since the last FOMC meeting, with much of that decline occurring yesterday.  Market -based measures of  uncertainty surged, with the VIX piercing 40 percent. August 9, 20116 of 162"
144,20110921,"conditions to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate at least through mid-2013.  That statement prompted implied short- term interest rates two years ahead to shift down by about 25 basis points, as investors interpreted the statement as indicating a lower probability that the federal f unds rate target would rise before that time.  Consistent with that interpretation, measures of implied volatility for interest rates around that horizon also declined notably in response to the FOMC statement.   Additional evidence on the change in investors’ expectations is provided by the Desk’s primary dealer survey.  As shown in the upper-right panel, the perceived chances of the first increase in the federal funds rate target occurring before the third quarter of 2013 fell significantly, partly reflecting the forward policy guidance from the August FOMC statement.  However, respondents still attached about 20 percent odds to the possibility that the first rate hike could occur before mid-2013, indicating that investors do not see the policy language as an unconditional commitment.  Instead, market participants reportedly see the policy guidance as “raising the bar” for policy action before that time.  The sense that the federal funds rate target will remain at its current level for a long period was reinforced by the incoming economic data, which pointed to an economy struggling to find its footing.  Indeed, since the last FOMC round, primary dealers slashed their GDP forecasts by roughly ½ percentage point per year for the period from 2011 to 2013 and raised their projections for the unemployment rate at the end of 2013 by nearly ¾ of a percentage point.  Moreover, dealers see the uncertainty surrounding the GDP outlook as unusually high and view the ri sks as skewed to the downside. Against this backdrop, Treasury yields moved down notably, as shown in the middle -left panel, with the largest declines in longer -term yields.  The movement in longer- term yields was partly driven by increased expectations that the FOMC will implement some type of maturity exte nsion program for the SOMA portfolio—one that would involve sizable purchases of longer- term securities.  As I will review in detail later, market participants are now placing very high odds on such a move at this FOMC meeting.  At this point, longer- term real interest rates have reached extraordinarily low levels.  Indeed, as shown to the right, the 10-year TIPS yield has been hovering around zero, which is well below its historical range.  An alternative measure of the real long- term interest rate based on  the difference between the 10- year nominal Treasury yield and a survey measure of long -term inflation expectations is also near zero, which is again quite unusual relative to its historical norms.  In my previous briefing, I noted that forward breakeven inflation rates had remained relatively high even as real interest rates had declined, suggesting that longer- term inflation expectations were well anchored.  While that still appears to be true in general, there are some signs that those expectations are coming under downward pressure.  As shown in the bottom-left panel, the five- year, five -year September 20–21, 20114 of 290forward  breakeven inflation rate fell notably over the intermeeting period, moving about halfway back to the levels seen last summer.  Moreover, as shown to the right, measures of the perceived odds of a sustained deflation derived from TIPS have risen some.  Investors’ concerns about economic growth prospects weighed on financial markets more broadly, contributing to considerable volatility in risky asset prices and a general sense of unease among market participants.  The negative sentiment in markets was exacerbated by the substantial risks that investors see surrounding the situation for European sovereign debt and financial institutions. Broad equity indexes, shown in the upper-left panel of your second exhibit, managed to move higher over the intermeeting period.  However, these gains come on the heels of the very steep declines that were observed ahead of the August meeting, leaving the S&P index still about 10 percent below its levels in July.  Moreover, as shown to the right, the volatility of daily changes in equity prices was the highest observed since early 2009, and measures of anticipated volatility, such as the VIX, have also been elevated.  Returning to the upper-left panel, the downward movement in equity prices over the past several months has been particularly sharp for financial institutions.  Investors are concerned not only about the effects of weaker economic growth prospects on bank profits, but also about legal risks associated with mortgage- backed securities and spillovers from financial stress in Europe.  Corporate bonds and other private debt instruments have also priced in a riskier environment, with corporate yield spreads widening to their highest levels since late 2009.  Corporate bond issuance by speculative- grade firms nearly came to a halt over the past  month or so. As noted earlier, the situation in Europe remains a key focus of market participants.  Steve Kamin will review European devel opments in greater detail in his briefing.  The abridged version is that investors do not know the endgame for Greek sovereign debt, they are not convinced that a sufficient backstop exists for the Spanish and Italian sovereign debt markets, they see uneve n progress toward fiscal consolidation and economic reform where needed, and they are concerned about the potential capital shortfalls for financial institutions that may arise from their exposures to these markets and economies. Among the key risks, market participants in recent weeks have had to contend with uncertainty about whether Greece will meet the necessary criteria for additional disbursements of funds.  Investors are not confident that a substantial debt restructuring is avoidable in the near term, pushing two-year yields on Greek debt as high as 75 percent at one point. Market pressures were also present for Spanish and Italian sovereign debt.  The ECB began conducting secondary-market purchases of Spanish and Italian debt in early August, which, as shown in the middle- left panel, initially managed to reverse the widening of yield spreads that had been observed before that time .  However, September 20–21, 20115 of 290yield spreads on Italian and Spanish debt have again widened in recent weeks, raising questions about the strength of this backstop.  The ECB has purchased more than €80 billion of sovereign debt since the August announcement, bringing the total size of the securities purchase program to €150 billion. The ECB seems intent on handing these responsibilities over to the EFSF.  However, European officials are still working to put in place the July 21 agreement to increase the capacity and scope of the EFSF.  Moreover, market participants already view that package as insufficient to provide capital to banks as needed and to provide a credible backstop for the sovereign debt of Italy and Spain. The challenges surrounding sovereign debt dynamics and the concerns about European banks are now being exacerbated by what appears to be a sharper slowdown in European economic growth than investors had anticipated a few months ago.  Against this backdrop, broad equity indexes in Europe have fallen substantially, far outpacing the declines in U.S. equity prices, as shown to the right.  Share prices for European banks have fallen even more abruptly, and their CDS spreads have widened, reflecting investors’ concerns about the health of these institutions. Such concerns have led  to significant strains in funding conditions for many European banks.  Money market funds and other investors have continued to pull back from providing unsecured dollar funding to many institutions.  At this point, with the exception of a short list of top-tier banks, all unsecured funding has collapsed to maturities of one week or less.  Banks that instead rely on obtaining dollar funding by borrowing in euros and using the FX swaps market to convert to dollars have seen their implied funding cost move up sharply, as shown in the bottom- left panel.  A few signs of pressure have even emerged for secured funding markets.  It has become more difficult to borrow against less liquid collateral, with investors requiring over- collateralization and higher rates for some transactions.  Moreover, there are some instances of investors cutting off secured funding against all types of collateral for particular European counterparties.  More broadly, however, secured funding markets for more -liquid collateral have remain ed unimpaired for most participants.  Moreover, U.S. financial institutions continue to have adequate access to term funding even on an unsecured basis.  Thus, the situation does not represent a widespread seizing -up of funding markets, but there are considerable risks that funding pressures could become worse and more widespread. In response to the intensifying dollar funding strains for European institutions, the ECB, the Bank of England, and the Swiss National Bank announced that they would begin offerin g 84-day dollar funding operations in mid-October, using the liquidity swap lines that are in place with the Federal Reserve.  We believe that the presence of these lines and the associated dollar operations have helped limit the deterioration in dollar fu nding conditions, because market participants know that a backstop is in place.  The introduction of 84-day operations should serve to strengthen this role.  The market response to the extension was favorable, with European bank share prices September 20–21, 20116 of 290"

[No response]  All right.  Thank you very much. Let’s turn now to item 2 on monetary policy frameworks.  Let me begin the discussion by turning to Michael Kiley, who will lead the staff presentation.  MR. KILEY.1  Thank you.  Early last month, Committee participants received a memo on “Alternative Monetary Policy Frameworks” that I coauthored with Chris Erceg and David Lopez -Salido.  The memo discussed several policy strategies that the Committee might wish to adopt that could potentially provide additional stimulus or protection against especially undesirable outcomes. As highlighted in the box at the top of your first exhibit, these commitment strategies are broadly consistent with flexible inflation targeting —that  is, with a policy framework that combines commitment to a medium-run inflation objective with the flexibility to respond to economic shocks as needed to moderate deviations of employment from its “full employment” level.  In our analysis, we assumed that the Committee aims to achieve an inflation rate of 2 percent, consistent with the majority of longer -run projections from the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP)                                                  1 The materials used by Mr. Kiley are append ed to this transcript (appendix 1).  November 1–2, 20115 of 282and other communications by the Committee.   In addition, the full employment goal is interpreted as an unemployment rate in the range of 5 to 6 percent, also consistent with the majority of longer -run projections from the SEP.   Given these objectives, we focused on how strategies that involve maki ng conditional commitments about how the policy rate will be adjusted going forward can contribute to improved macroeconomic outcomes relative to the current strategy of the Committee, which might be described as one of constrained discretion.  To illustra te the role of commitment, we considered two examples of optimal control simulations of the type presented in the Tealbook using the FRB/US model:  One example, the “discretion” case, assumes that policymakers follow an optimal policy on a period- by-period basis and are unwilling to promise future accommodation; the second example, the “commitment” case, assumes that policymakers are willing to commit (conditional on economic outcomes) to future policies that are potentially more expansionary than would otherwise be chosen in order to stimulate activity today. As shown in the figures in the next three panels (which also include the projections in the September Tealbook, which are little different from those in the most recent projection), these different app roaches result in notable differences in outcomes for inflation and unemployment.  In the discretion case, policy, as measured by the federal funds rate (reported in the middle- left panel) is only slightly more accommodative than in the Tealbook baseline, whereas the commitment approach involves a plan to maintain the federal funds rate near zero  until the end of 2015.  In the simulation, the additional accommodation under the commitment approach brings about a persistent fall in the unemployment rate (shown in the middle-right panel) and a sustained rise in inflation (reported at the bottom left) to a little over 2 percent.  Given the tight labor market and slightly above- target rate of inflation in future years under the commitment strategy, future policym akers would presumably be tempted to renege on the accommodative policy stance promised, but given their commitment, they are assumed not to do so. As highlighted in the memo and noted in the bottom-right box, several features of the optimal policy evident in the FRB/US simulations appear robust across a range of models.  First, the optimal policy given the baseline outlook involves a commitment to hold the nominal funds rate near zero  roughly until the unemployment rate approaches its natural rate.  Second , unemployment falls below its natural rate and inflation may rise above its target for a time later in the decade under an optimal commitment strategy.   Third, while the degree of inflation overshooting is larger in dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models such as EDO and SIGMA than in FRB/US, optimal policies do not result in inflation substantially above 2½ percent for a protracted period under the modal outlook in the models we examined.   While there appears to be substantial benefits in principle from following an optimal commitment strategy, “optimal” policies may be of limited use in FOMC communications, because they are both complex and model- dependent, and because they do not provide clear guidance about how the Committee would respond to November 1–2, 20116 of 282"

We’ re taking that seriously and trying to figure out a solution. Second, on the New York staff forecast, this was something that had been going on for some time but was discontinued in June after the new policy on external communication was adopted.  So it was in response to that policy that this practice was discontinued.  And, in addition, you may be aware that the past forecasts were posted on the web last week in conjunction with an article by Simon Potter of the New York Fed on the ability of the Fed to forecast the recession, which of course was not very good, and the forecasts were put ther e as an illustration of some of the problems and issues that had come up.  Now, that said, when the reporter was researching her story and the items  relating the forecast materials  were shown to us, I asked Bill English and Scott Alvarez, pursuant to our policies, to take a look at it and see if there was anything in there that did raise issues concerning our policies, as is required by our approach.  Now, at this point, I think it’s rather moot.  But it is worthwhile for us to look at this episode briefly because we all deal with the problem of forecasts, have boards and councils, meet with outside individuals, and talk about the outlook in various ways.  So I think it would be beneficial  for us to make use of this to try to clarify for ourselves how best t o use staff forecasting information.   After  Scott and Bill f inish th eir look at this particular episode, I think we should maybe have a brief discussion at some point about how we treat forecasts and that kind of information—in dealing with our boards, for example.  Finally, a third issue came up, which was not in the article in any way—it was not referred to —but I got requests from an FOMC participant to look once again at the issue of the dealer survey, which , as you know, we put out before each meeting to the dealers , confidentially November 28, 20114 of 40asking them for their views on likely Fed policies, along with issues relating to the economy and so on.  And there’ s been a concern raised in meetings that the dealer survey —which , again , was not mentioned in the article b ut nevertheless raises similar concerns —might provide or appear to provide preferential information to the recipients of the survey.  Now, I raised this wi th Vice Chairman  Dudley and Brian Sack, and from their perspective, it’ s perfectly fine to go ahead and start releasing the survey in real time, which we can do as early as Friday for the December meeting.  The alternative would be to have some kind of Committee process, which I think none of us are particularly excited about but which I’ m willing to do if there ’s a strong desire for it.  In a moment I ’ll ask for comment, but the proposal is just to start releasing it, and of course we’ ll look carefully at it to make sure that it doesn’t have any implied preferential information in it.  We’ll start that on  Friday.  So those are just a few reactions.  Vice Chairman  Dudley wants to comment, and then I’ ll be happy to take any questions or comments on this particular issue.  Bill. VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  To clarify on the release of the primary dealer survey, we’re talking about releasing just the questions, not the actual results of the survey. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I think that’s okay, but others can comment.  Does anyone have any reactions they ’d like to share?  [No response]  Okay.  Seeing none, why don’t we turn to the business of the meeting.  I think the best way to do this would be to turn first to Brian Sack, who will give us, as background, some markets updates, and then Steve Kamin here at the Board will talk about what’s happening in Europe as they try to address the ongoing crisis.  I’ ll say a few words about calls and contacts that I’ve had, and then we’ll open up the discussion of the particular proposal.  So let me turn it over to Brian Sack for an update on markets.  Brian. November 28, 20115 of 40MR. SACK.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Concerns about whether an orderly resolution to the European sovereign debt crisis can be achieved  have intensified further, dominating developments in global financial markets in recent weeks. Investors have come to view the measures that were agreed to in October, including the possibility of leveraging the EFSF funds using private capital, as inadequate to provide a credible backstop to European sovereign debt markets.  The absence of this backstop, along with the decision to include a larger degree of private-sector participation in the voluntary restructuring of Greek debt, has put considerable pressure on European sovereign debt markets.  Yields on Italian and Spanish debt have increased over 100 basis points over the past three weeks, with the 10- year yield approaching 7 percent in Spain and surpassing that level in Italy.  Liquidity in these securities has deteriorated significantly as the perceived risk has increased.  At this point, the only backstop in the market is the purchases of sovereign de bt by the European Central Bank  under its Securities Market s Program me.  However, the ECB is seen as somewhat reluctant to perform this role, and  its purchases have been paired with a constant reminder from European officials that the ECB cannot provide monetary financing to governments.  Many observers feel that the ECB will not take a more aggressive approach until there is greater clarity on a longer- term solution to Europe’s fiscal challenges, which will likely take some time.  Given these circu mstances, investors have increasingly considered the possibility of a more disorderly outcome for the euro area, including broader debt restructuring or changes in the composition of the currency union.  Reflecting such concerns, core European countries ha ve increasingly been swept into the negative market dynamics.  Ten-year yields in France, Austria, Belgium, and the Netherlands have all come under upward pressure, increasing by 50 to 150 basis points since the most recent  FOMC meeting.  Even German debt yields began to rise last week, with investors’ concerns reflected in a very weak auction of 10- year debt.  The anxiety about European sovereign debt is also apparent in the CDS written on that debt.  At this point, five-year CDS is at 555 basis points for Italy, 488 basis points for Spain, 408 basis points for Belgium, 245 basis points for France, and 117 basis points for Germany.  Those compare with  a CDS rate of just 59 basis points for the United States despite our own set of fiscal issues. The intensification of concerns about European sovereign debt has weighed on the prices of risk y assets broadly, with the S&P 500 index off about 10 percent since the Friday before the most recent FOMC meeting.  Over that period, corporate bond spreads and other private debt spreads have widened notably, and Treasury yields have fallen.  The dollar has appreciated, including a sharp gain against the euro. The financial sector has been under the most significant pressure over this period, with equity indexes for U.S. banks and financial institutions falling 15 to 20 percent.  This repricing appears to be driven by worries about direct exposures to European markets as well as by concerns about the indirect channels through which an November 28, 20116 of 40"

Our second item is “Financial Developments and Open Market Operations,” and I’ll turn, as usual , to Brian Sack. MR. SACK.1  Financial markets have remained volatile, with investors heavily focused on the policy steps taken to address the European sovereign debt crisis and the associated pressures on bank funding. Market sentiment had improved notably in advance of last week’s summit of European Union leaders, as investors hoped for considerable progress toward establishing mechanisms that would ensure fiscal discipline by European governments and strengthen the support available to those governments if needed.  Many market participants thought that those steps would open the door to more aggressive purchases of European sovereign bonds in the secondary market by the European Central Bank.  These expectations contributed to a sharp narrowing of the spreads on Spanish, Italian, and French debt, as shown in the upper- left panel of your first exhibit.  However, market ex pectations apparently got a bit ahead of reality.  Important policy steps were in fact agreed to at the EU summit, as Steve Kamin will review.  However, they do not put to rest the risks associated with sovereign debt, and many uncertainties remain about t he implementation and enforceability of the steps taken.  Moreover, comments by ECB President Draghi ahead of the summit were seen as backing away from more aggressive bond purchases, and ECB officials gave no indication after the summit of a shift in that posture.  In response to these developments, the spreads on those debt securities again turned higher in recent days, reversing much of the earlier declines.  Needless to say, market participants see the situation surrounding European sovereign debt as ver y uncertain, resulting in remarkable volatility in these securities and very poor liquidity at times.  This is not the type of environment that is conducive to attracting private capital back to the market, which is of great concern considering that Italy and Spain have financing needs in excess of €500 billion next year.  These tensions are further exacerbated by the decision by S&P to place the long -term credit ratings of 15 euro-zone countries and the EFSF on negative credit watch.  Moody’s yesterday als o indicated that it would review the sovereign ratings of euro- area countries. In contrast to the uncertainties surrounding the support of sovereign debt, central banks took clear and decisive steps regarding the provision of liquidity to the financial sector.  The ECB announced that it would extend its fixed- rate, full -allotment operations in euros to a horizon of three years, and it made several adjustments that will help loosen the constraints that some banks are facing on the                                                  1 The materials used by Mr. Sack are appended to this transcript (appendix 1).  December 13, 20114 of 198availability of collateral for such operations.  As shown in the upper-right panel, banks have been tapping the ECB’s facilities for larger amounts of euro liquidity in recent months, with much of the increased borrowing coming from French and Italian banks. Of course, central banks also took actions to address global funding needs in dollars.  On November 30, the Federal Reserve, along with five central bank counterparties, announced changes to the liquidity swap arrangements, including the decision to reduce the rate on those transactions to 50 basis points over the OIS rate.  The reaction in financial markets was favorable.  The implied dollar funding rate that could be obtained through FX swaps fell about 40 basis points after the announcement, as shown in the middle- left panel.  Moreover, while the dollar LIBOR  rate did not react, a forward measure of the rate came down about 15 basis points, as shown to the right. The first set of operations by the foreign central banks to inject dollar funding under this new pricing saw a meaningful pickup in demand.  In particular, the ECB received nearly $51 billion of bids at its 84-day dollar operation last week, spread across 34 bidders, and about $1½ billion at its 7-day operation.  This outcome was seen as encouraging, as the broad partici pation suggested that the stigma around the swap lines had been reduced.  The Bank of Japan placed nearly $5 billion at its 84-day operation earlier today, while other central banks saw minimal participation in their operations. The policy measures taken i n recent weeks have also affected the amount of risk that investors perceive for the financial sector.  Five- year CDS rates for major European and U.S. financial institutions, shown in the bottom- left panel, came off their peak s in response to the swap line announcement and to hopes about the outcome of the EU summit.  However, these measures remain quite elevated, as the tensions surrounding the European situation are seen as presenting some systemic risk for the financial sector.  In addition, some of the largest domestic banks and broker–dealers were downgraded by S&P as a result of a new methodology that the company is employing.  However, the downgrades were largely expected and did not elicit any notable response in financial markets.  The financial str ess in Europe, along with increasing evidence of a sharper slowdown in European economic growth, caused the euro to weaken notably against the dollar, as shown in  the bottom- right  panel .  The dollar has strengthened more broadly since the summer, as indicated by the trade-weighted index, in part because of safe -haven flows into dollar assets. As highlighted in the upper-left panel of your second exhibit, U.S. equity prices have also been driven to a large extent by European developments.  After falling early in the intermeeting period, equity prices rebounded sharply in response to the swap line announcement and in expectation of possible actions at the EU summit.  On balance, the S&P index ended the inter meeting period modestly higher. December 13, 20115 of 198Equity prices were also supported by the backdrop of favorable U.S. economic data.  As shown in the upper- right panel, the economic data generally came in above expectations, leading investors to revise up their projections for fourth -quarter GDP growth.  However, judging from the Desk’s survey of primary dealers, market participants have not raised their GDP forecasts over the next two years.  Indeed, respondents continue to expect the recovery to be modest, with the median forecasts of GDP growth in 2012 and 2013 coming in at 2.1 percent and 2.5 percent, respectively.  The unemployment rate is expected to remain elevated, and inflation is expected to be low.  The strains that are present in Europe are seen by market participants as an important factor weighing on the outlook for the U.S. economy.  In its survey, the Desk asked how the dealers’ forecasts for 2012 U.S. GDP growth would be affected by a timely and convincing resolution of the European fiscal and banking situation.  As shown in the middle- left panel, the responses were fairly evenly distributed over a wide range, suggesting that it is difficult to calibrate the effects.  Nevertheless, many of the responses indicated fairly sizable effects, with the median response at ½ percentage point of annual GDP growth.  In addition, market participants likely see the situation in Europe as presenting significant downside risks around the baseline forecast.  Indeed, many respondents to the survey indicated that the risks to thei r GDP forecasts are skewed to the downside.  The subpar economic outlook has supported the view that monetary policy will remain accommodative for a long period, which has kept Treasury yields at very low levels.  As shown in the middle-right panel, Treasury yields were little changed, on balance, over the intermeeting period, with the 10- year yield currently near 2 percent.  Primary dealers continue to nudge out their expectations for the path of the federal funds rate.  As shown in the bottom- left panel, respondents see a nearly 50 percent probability that the first policy tightening will not occur until the second quarter of 2014 or later. The Desk’s survey also asked primary dealers about the likelihood of additional policy steps.  As reported in the bottom-right panel, while dealers are generally not anticipating such steps at this meeting, they see considerable odds of several types of actions taking place over the next year, with an 80 percent probability assigned to changing the guidance for the federal funds rate and a 60 percent probability assigned to expanding the balance sheet further.  While we did not ask about it in the survey, market participants seem to expect that further balance sheet expansion, if it occurs, will be partly  or fully concentrated in MBS.  The survey also included a question about the likelihood of two structural changes to FOMC communications over the next year.  About 75 percent of respondents said that they expect the FOMC to provide more information on its policy objectives, such as specifying its longer -run inflation goal.  A similar portion expects the FOMC to provide information about participants’ assessment of appropriate monetary policy in the Summary of Economic Projections. December 13, 20116 of 198"

I’ d like to start by recognizing our colleague, Larry Slifman , who is at his last meeting before his planned retirement. Larry is still fairly junior , having been on the Board staff almost 42 years.  [Laughter]  He has attended 183 FOMC meetings over 30 years.  At one day per meeting, that’ s almost exactly six month s of FOMC meetings.  [Laughter] Larry has shown great economic insight but has also excelled in mentoring others in the art of presenting complex material to the Board in the clearest and most logical manner. Larry, those of us around the table and many predecessors have benefited greatly from your dedicated service. Congratulations and best wishes for the next phase.  Thank you very much.  [Applause] CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. I ’d like to welcome, of course, President Lacker, President Lockhart, President Pian alto, and President Williams to the FOMC.  We will have a formal organizational part of the meeting a little bit later this morning, but I thought it would be useful first to begin with our special topic, which we’re looking forward to.  The topic is the role of financial conditions in economic recovery :  lending and leverage.  This was a highly favored pick of FOMC participants when we polled you last year about what you would like to talk about.  I particularly want to thank Glenn Rudebusch in San Francisco for organizing this session and acknowledge the presenters, John Duca from Dallas, Andrew Haughwout from New York, and Daniel Cooper from Boston.  Let me call on John. MR. DUCA.1  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I will be referring to the handout on lending and leverage.  This presentation, coauthored with Anthony Murphy, links the sluggish recovery in personal consumption expenditures (PCE) to financial factors and then shows how movements in consumption reflect long- and short-run shifts in 1 The materials used by Mr. Duca, Mr. Haughwout, and Mr. Cooper are appended to this transcript (appendix 1).January 24–25, 20125 of 314wealth and the av ailability of consumer and mortgage credit.  We end by discussing how recent consumer spending has been bolstered by some stabilization of household balance sheets, coupled with an upturn in the supply of consumer credit. To provide a benchmark, exhibit 1 plots real per capita consumption normalized around the prior five major business cycle peaks.  Consumer spending barely fell during these recessions—whether in terms of the average of those cycles (the black line) or their range (the shaded gray area). In the current cycle (the red line), consumer spending declined by nearly 5 percentage points before hitting bottom.  Moreover, in the earlier episodes, consumption recovered rapidly.  By comparison, per capita consumer spending has rebounded slowly so far in the current cycle—not even retracing its decline since late 2007. As implied by exhibit 2, weak consumption reflects not only weak income, but also a higher personal saving rate (the red line), which jumped about 4 percentage points during the Great Recession, not noticeably declining until recently.  This contrasts with earlier major cycles (the black line) when the saving rate changed little. Turning to exhibit 3, the unusual rise in the saving rate coincides with a large decline in credit availability , as tracked by our credit conditions index (described later).  On average, consumer credit conditions (the black line) turned up about a year after a business cycle peak.  However, in the current cycle, consumer credit conditions have been noticeably weaker (the red line), taking 10 quarters after the peak to start increasing.  The rise in the index in the past four quarters coincides with the recent upturn in nonrevolving consumer credit. Turning to exhibit 4, it is helpful to understand recent developments by reviewing longer-term movements in the personal saving rate.  The saving rate (the black line) fluctuated between 8 and 10 percent until the mid-1970s.  Apart from some temporary upticks during recessions, the saving rate trended down until 2008: Q1. In the standard lifecycle/permanent income framework, consumption depends on permanent income and on wealth.  This implies that the saving rate (the black line) and the ratio of wealth -to-income (the blue line) should generally move in opposite directions, as they do.  Nevertheless, the current saving rate is considerably lower than in the 1970s, despite similar wealth- to-income ratios in the two periods.  This anomaly does not go away if wealth is disaggregated into different components to reflect their different influences on consumption.  Some additional factor is affecting the saving rate. Most of the nonstock wealth -induced movements in the saving rate since the mid -1970s stem from shifts in the availability of consumer and home equity credit and changes in mortgage credit standards that affected house prices.  Our model of consumption, which disaggregates wealth and controls for standard factors—such as income, unemployment, and interest rates—incorporates two important, novel features.  First, we estimate shifts in the sensitivity of consumption to housing wealth stemming from regulatory changes and mortgage innovations.  This affects the impactJanuary 24–25, 20126 of 314of housing wealth on consumption, the so -called marginal propensity to consume out of housing wealth.  Second, we track exogenous shifts in the supply of consumer credit using a consumer credit conditions index.  Before using our model to understand the recent behavior of consumption and saving, it is initially helpful to look at changes in the main components of household balance sheets and to review the more novel features of our model. Exhibit 5 illustrates the division of household wealth in our model into net liquid assets, illiquid financial assets, and gross housing assets, shown as shares of disposable income.  Net liquid assets (the red line) are the sum of deposits and cash-like instruments minus consumer and mortgage debt.  The downturn in this ratio since the early 1990s mainly reflects increased mortgage borrowing.  Illiquid financial assets (the green line) aggregate stock, bond, pension, and other illiquid financial assets, with a twin peak pattern reflecting large swings in stock prices. In the mid -2000s, the ratios of illiquid financial assets to income and of gross housing assets to income (the blue line) rose and fell by similar amounts. As reported in exhibit 6, the estimated effect of net liquid assets on consumption exceeds that of illiquid fin ancial assets.  Our model estimates indicate that a $100 rise in net liquid assets raises annual consumption by over $13, compared with a $2 impact from the same increase in illiquid financial assets. One reason for the difference is that households have more time and discretion to adjust their spending in response to stock price movements, whereas they incur penalties for missing debt payments.  In addition, illiquid financial asset holdings are concentrated among wealthy households, whereas debt is less unevenly distributed. There is less agreement in the economics profession about whether, and by how much, housing wealth influences consumption.  In a realistic setting, where some households are credit constrained and consumer credit is more expensive than mortgage debt, increased housing wealth can boost consumer spending.  Because homeowners’ ability to borrow against housing equity has changed over time—as a result of tax changes and financial innovations—the impact on consumption of swings in housing w ealth is time -varying. Exhibit 7 illustrates how the estimated impact of housing wealth on consumption has evolved over time.  In response to a $100 increase in gross housing assets, annual consumption rose from as little as 50 cents in the 1970s and early 1980s, to a high of about $3.50 by 2005.  This effect fell sharply to about $2 .25 cents by early 2011.  The timing of the movements in the estimated liquidity of housing wealth coincides with tax, regulatory , and financial innovations that plausibly affected homeowners’ ability to tap housing equity.  Our estimates of consumption’ s sensitivity (or marginal propensity to consume) to housing wealth are smaller than those from conventional models because we also control for changes in two commonly omitted var iables, permanent income and consumer credit availability. Exhibit 8 plots the second of these, our measure of consumer credit conditions.  This is derived from a diffusion index based on the question in the Senior Loan"
149,20120313,"March 13, 20124 of 213levels of the unemployment rate if inflation were running lower.  The median response from the survey has the first increase in the federal funds target rate occurring with the unemployment rate around 7 percent and the inflation rate around 2 percent. The chart also shows that this schedul e has moved lower since last September, when the Desk first asked this question.  This shift suggests that the change in the forward guidance caused market participants to reevaluate their assessment of the Committee’s policy reaction function, with the FO MC now expected to wait for a lower level of the unemployment rate for a given level of inflation compared with the September survey. Even though the commitment is viewed as conditional, the policy guidance had a meaningful effect on the amount of uncertainty perceived around the path of interest rates.  As shown to the right, the implied volatility of short- term interest rates three years ahead —the horizon roughly consistent with the “ late 2014 ” guidance at the time of the FOMC statement —moved down on the announcement, as investors saw higher chances that short-term interest rates would remain unchanged.  It has since moved higher, presumably because the incoming data have raised the probability that economic conditions would warrant an earlier liftoff, although it remains very low by historical standards. The prospect that the federal funds rate could remain at its current levels through late 2014 is clearly helping to hold down Treasury yields.  In addition, the balance sheet policies implemented by the FOMC are also playing a role by keeping the term premium very low.  As shown in the bottom- left panel, the 10- year term premium measured by the Kim –Wright model stands at minus 50 basis points, which is about 125 basis points below its average level since the late 1990s. Analysis by the Board staff suggests that the FOMC’s balance sheet actions have kept this term premium about 60 basis points lower than it would otherwise be, explaining about half of the deviation from its longer-run average.  Of course, tha t estimate implies that the term premium would still be unusually low even in the absence of the FOMC’s balance sheet actions.  These patterns suggest that there is some risk that yields could move up meaningfully at some point, particularly as investors c ome to see the balance sheet as a less active policy instrument or anticipate a return of more -normal interest rate uncertainty. Perhaps reflecting such risk, the premium on options that provide protection against a rise in interest rates has been increas ing in recent months. The panel to the right focuses on the inflation prospects priced into the Treasury market.  As can be seen, the five-year breakeven inflation rate has moved higher, driven by increases in energy prices and greater optimism about the g rowth outlook.  However, the five- year, five- year-forward measure edged down, as longer- term inflation expectations remain well contained.March 13, 20125 of 213Your next exhibit turns to recent actions by the ECB and related developments in financial markets.  As noted earlier , gains in risky asset prices have been driven in part by a perception that the risks related to the European situation have been reduced.  While several factors have likely contributed to this perception, the most important development has been the three-year liquidity operations ( the LTROs) offered by the ECB. As shown in the upper-left panel, the three-year LTRO offered on February 29 was again met with substantial demand.  This operation, in combination with the first LTRO back in December, boosted excess liquidity in the euro area to about €800 billion.  At this point, the total amount of funding operations offered by the ECB stands at €1.1 trillion, with about 90 percent of that funding having a maturity of three years. These liquidity operations helped improve funding conditions for European banks, as the LTROs all but eliminated the risk that banks would not be able to meet the substantial borrowing needs that they face over the first half of this year. Reflecting this improvement, the spread of thre e-month euro- denominated L IBOR over the OIS rate, shown to the right, has narrowed dramatically since the introduction of the LTROs.  Moreover, European banks have been able to tap longer-term credit markets in larger size, issuing more debt over the past two months than they had over the entire second half of 2011. Improvements have also been notable in dollar-denominated funding markets.  As shown in the chart, the dollar-denominated L IBOR –OIS spread is now well off its peak, and anecdotal evidence indicates that some European financial institutions have been able to extend their unsecured funding in dollars to longer maturities.  Similar improvements have been realized in the FX swap market, with the implied cost of dollar funding down sharply from last y ear’s levels.  Reflecting these positive developments, the total outstanding balance for the dollar liquidity swap lines with foreign central banks has declined from a peak of $110 billion to its current level of $65 billion. In addition to its effects on bank funding conditions, the LTROs have helped bring down the sovereign debt spreads for peripheral European countries, in part because the availability of this funding has allowed banks to hold larger amounts of that debt than they otherwise would have maintained.  The effect on sovereign yields has been more powerful than we had anticipated, with two- year Spanish and Italian spreads, shown in the middle-left panel, now having returned to levels observed last summer.  As shown to the right, data for January show that Spanish and Italian banks did in fact increase their holdings of European debt following the first LTRO. The improvement in European sovereign debt markets occurred despite the realization of a default event on Greek debt.  Greek authorities ex ecuted a sizable debt exchange under which investors accepted a significant reduction in the principal value of their debt holdings.  To achieve sufficient participation in this exchange, the Greek authorities last Friday exercised collecti ve action clauses on those securities—March 13, 20126 of 213clauses that they had retroactively inserted just a few weeks earlier.  As expected, this development led ISDA’s Determinations Committee to decide that a credit event had occurred, triggering CDS contracts written on Greek sovereign debt.  The CDS contracts will be settled following an auction process that will take place on March 19.  At this point, market participants appear confident that the settlement process will proceed without any significant problems, with about $3 billion of net notional CDS to be settled. Despite the passing of these key events, a number of important risks surround the European situation going forward, as Steve Kamin will discuss.  These ongoing risks may be contributing to the cautious attitude that investo rs have regarding the U.S. financial sector. This sector also faces a range of questions about firms’ business prospects and the ultimate effects of regulatory reform efforts.  These concerns appear to be reflected in the CDS spreads for major U.S. financ ial firms, shown in the bottom-left panel.  Although these spreads have improved since late last year, they remain well above the levels observed in the middle of 2011.  This week, market participants are intently focused on the CCAR results that will be r eleased, given the information that the results will provide about the strength of firms’ balance sheets and the implications that might be drawn about their capital distribution plans. The improvement in risk sentiment among investors, and the associated reduction in safe-haven asset demands, put modest downward pressure on the broad dollar index, as shown in the bottom-right panel.  One currency that has bucked this trend is the Japanese yen, which depreciated about 6 percent against the dollar over the intermeeting period.  This movement in part reflected the recent policy decision by the Bank of Japan to increase the amount of its asset purchases and to introduce a 1 percent inflation goal.  Market participants have also focused to a greater degree on the erosion in Japan’s trade balance, which has moved into deficit, perhaps contributing to the weakness of the yen. Your final exhibit summarizes recent Desk operations and their effects on financial markets. As summarized in the upper- left panel, the Desk has completed about $240 billion of the purchases and sales associated with the m aturity extension program.  These operations have generally been met with decent demand.  However, as I noted in my last briefing, our purchases of long-term bonds had seen a trend toward lower coverage ratios and worse prices relative to market benchmarks.  To address this issue, the Desk made a minor modification to its purchase schedule to operate more frequently and in smaller size in the bond sector, while achieving the sa me aggregate amount of purchases.  So far, this change appears to have improved the performance of those operations. As shown to the right, the transactions for the m aturity extension program have been lengthening the average duration of our Treasury holdi ngs, with this measure expected to reach seven years by the end of the program.

And I urge everybody to keep thinking about these issues and to participate actively in our discussion in June. What I want to do now is turn to Thomas Laubach, whom we we lcome back to the Federal Reserve after some absence.  T homas was a coauthor of mine, and we worked on a book on inflation targeting many years ago.  Thomas is going to report on the scenarios exercise, and after he reports , we’ll have a chance for Q&A .  And then I would be interested to hear anyone who has any views on whether this is a constructive direction and, if it is, what further steps we might take. So—Thomas. MR. LAUBACH.1  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I’ll be referring to the handout in front of you called “Material for Alternative Scenarios for Contingency Planning.” At the March meeting, several of you suggested that a discussion of alternative scenarios could provide a means for the Committee to consider how policy would respond to different contingencies—something that could both facilitate your internal policy discussion and possibly also be used to provide more information to the public about your thinking.  To explore the potential of this idea, we sent you a memo that outlined four different scenarios for the evolution of the economy over the next six months, and then asked you a few questions intended to elicit your views on how policy might respond to these developments.  You all joined the game, and your responses to our questions were, we think, quite informative.  Before reviewing them, however, we should emphasize that this exercise was only an experiment and that the results should thus be interpreted cautiously.  In addition, our categorization of your responses required, in some cases, a little judgment on our part, and others might score the results somewhat differently. The main results from the survey are summarized in the top panel of the first page of the handout.  As noted by the first bullet, most of you said that scenario 1 —the scenario consistent with the March Tealbook forecast —was the one closest to your own modal outlook.  Specifically, the middle -left panel shows that nine of you opted for scenario 1, while three of you thought the stronger activity of scenario 2 was more likely, and two of you chose the modest growth and somewhat higher inflation of scenario 4.  Finally, three of you resisted our attempt to shoehorn you into one scenario or the other, and said that a mix of scenario 1 with either 2 or 3 was most likely. 1 The materials used by Mr. Laubach are appended to this transcript (appendix 1).April 24–25, 20125 of 226Returning to the upper panel, most of you thought that the differences across scenarios were large enough to merit  adjustments from scenario to scenario in your individual  assessment of appropriate policy.  This outcome was not obvious to us beforehand because the scenarios were not all that different relative to the uncertainty associated with forecasts six months ahead.  In any event, the middle -right table summarizes how your assessments of appropriate policy in scenarios 2, 3, and 4 qualitatively differed from your own assessment of appropriate policy in scenario 1.  Excluding four participants, for whom we were not able to infer their views on this issue, a lmost all of you thought that scenarios 2 and 4 would call for less accommodation relative to scenario 1, while scenario 3 would call for more accommodation.  In defining a change in accommodation, we include changes in your own assessment of appropriate announcements about the projected date of liftoff as well as any changes to the portfolio. Many of you also provided information on the appropriateness of additional balance sheet actions in the various scenarios.  As noted in the third bullet of the top panel, 10 of you said that additional asset purchases or actions to increase the duration of the SOMA portfolio would be, or at least could be, appropriate in response to the relatively weak economic conditions of scenario 3.  In addition, 4 of you mentioned that additional LSAPs or portfolio actions would be appropriate in scenario 1, and another 2 thought they could be appropriate, depending on the balance of risks. As noted under the fourth bullet in the top panel, many of you provided enough information for us to infer your views on whether the current policy—defined as preserving the “at least through late 2014” language but initiating no additional asset purchases or a new MEP —should be maintained or modified in each scenario. For our purposes, we score advancing the expected date of liftoff as a tightening in policy and, conversely , delaying the date as an easing; additional asset purchases, a new MEP, or adopting “aggressive” thresholds for inflation and unemployment are also scored as easing.  The results are summarized in the table at the bottom.  As sh own in the first column, 8 participants favor maintaining the status quo in scenario 1, while 3 of you favor easing policy further.  In response to the stronger activity of scenario 2, however, 13 of you favored  announcing a less accommodative policy than that now in place, generally by bringing forward the expected liftoff date for the funds rate.  A very similar result holds for the somewhat higher inflation conditions of scenario 4.  In contrast, 12 of you favored easing relative to current policy under the relatively weak conditions of scenario 3, primarily by purchasing additional assets or by lengthening the duration of the portfolio.  In this context, 3 of you expressed doubts that pushing the date-related forward guidance beyond late 2014 would be cr edible. Returning to the upper panel, the final bullet notes that several of you made it clear that your policy assessments depend not only on your modal outlooks for real activity and inflation, but also on your assessments of downside and upside risks .  Among the downside risks mentioned was fiscal policy, which several of you thought could be particularly important later this year.April 24–25, 20126 of 226Turning to the second exhibit, we also asked whether you would have found additional information on the economy helpful in answering questions about the four scenarios.  As indicated by the first bullet, many of you emphasized the difficulty of judging the appropriate response of monetary policy in the four scenarios without data for a broader array of indicators. As noted in the second bullet, you cited a number of examples; most frequently mentioned were additional measures of inflation and inflation expectations, house prices, a broader array of financial variables and indicators of financial stress, measures of foreign economic conditions and trade, additional labor market indicators such as initial claims, and survey data on business conditions such as the ISM.  Five of you also highlighted the importance of anecdotal information from business contacts.  Based on this feedback, any future exercise may therefore require more information —with the caveat that scenarios that are very complex and specific ma y be of limited help in advancing a general discussion about the appropriate policy response to changes in economic conditions. As reported under the third major bullet, several of you questioned the general design of the exercise. In particular, some of you noted that the scenario descriptions did not identify the fundamental shocks hitting the economy, nor did they reveal how events might play out over time. Although we left out this information to preserve the “real time” spirit of the exercise, some o f you suggested that these exercises would be more useful if we provided details on the longer- run implications , perhaps through model simulations that extended several years into the future. Finally, several of you commented on how this sort of exercise might be used in the future should the Committee decide to repeat the experiment .  Three of you suggested that such exercises could be useful for internal deliberations, but thought that the Committee would need to develop further the use of, and discussions about, alternative scenarios before they could be employed for communications purposes.  In addition, two participants suggested that alternative scenarios could be used to develop a general description of the Committee’s policy reaction function.   Thank you; that concludes my prepared remarks.  We would be happy to take your questions. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Are there any questions for Thomas? MR. FISHER.  Can I make a comment, Mr. Chairman? CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Certainly. MR. FISHER.  First, I want to thank Thomas for making some sense out of this exercise.

151,20120620,"June 19–20, 20124 of 281VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Thank you.  I think Brian has had an extraordinary three years as head of the Markets Group and SOMA manager.  It probably feels like dog years rather than people years.  [Laughter]  The balance sheet hasn’t changed very much in terms of size on your watch, but the composition certai nly has. The Desk has been extraordinarily busy completing the first LSAP program of agency MBS and T reasuries , the second LSAP program, which probably got a little bit more attention than the first maturity extension program, and, of course, the reinvest ment of maturing MBS securities. The fact that all of the MBS operations were brought in -house under Brian’s watch is also very important.  Moreover, Brian has been an exemplary leader, with intelligence, knowledge, the ability to relate monetary policy a nd macro to markets, and the ability to see the forest for the trees .  He has also  managed the Markets Group effectively.  It has expanded from 230 people when I was the head of the Markets Group to about 400 people today, and its functions have broadened considerably as the financial stability mandate of the System has increased. I think you all would agree with me that he has been a terrific resource for the Committee, not only through his briefings and ability to answer all our questions but also in terms of the quality of product that is coming out of the Markets Group, in terms of the daily briefings , and the M arket SOURCE  material, which has really been upgraded significantly under his watch. He has been a very able advis er to me and to Governor Yellen.  He speaks his mind, makes very good points, and has very definitely improved my own thinking.  He has kept me out of trouble on numerous occasions.  He has just been a joy for me personally to work with, and I am going to miss him not being in this role any longer.  But the good news is that the Markets Group, under his stewardship, is quite deep.  Lorie Logan, sitting next to him, is a very senior person in Markets, as is Kevin Sti roh.  And with the new head of the Markets Group, they willJune 19–20, 20125 of 281continue on in the tradition that we have had in recent years.  Thank you, Brian, for your efforts.  It has been a privilege.  [Applause] CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. No one can replace Brian, but someone can succeed him.  Our first item is the propos al to appoint Simon P otter as manager of the System Open Market Account.  And accompanying that, because Simon is currently an a ssociate economist of the FOMC, the item also proposes that we appoint Jamie McAndrews to replace Simon in that role.  Both appointments would be eff ective June 30 and would hold until the selection of successors at the first regularly scheduled organizational meeting next January.  I would like to turn to the Vice Chairman to talk a bit about the selection process that produced Simon’s name. VICE CHAI RMAN DUDLEY.  Thank you.  We obviously take whom we have at the head of the Markets Group and as the SOMA manager extraordinarily seriously, and we ran a very complete and thorough process to identify a successor.  We hired Spencer St uart as a search firm,  and they identified a large number of candidates that we augmented by our own knowledge and contacts throughout the m arkets  business.  We identified five criteria that we think are important for the SOMA manager and head of the Markets Group—macroeconomic monetary policy knowledge, knowledge of markets, knowledge of the Fed, demonstrated management ability, and demonstrated operations experience.  Now, it turns out that as far as we can tell , nobody in the world actually has all five of those attributes.  [Laughter]  But we think having three and a half of them  is about as good as you can do, and I would apply that grade to myself and to Brian when we took on that job.  It is the kind of position where you are not going to be expert in all things when you start, but the Markets Group is really deep and able, and they have shown their ability to nurture the past two heads of Markets in a very successful way.June 19–20, 20126 of 281We went through the search process, and we identified a number of strong candidates both within the Ne w York Fed, elsewhere in the Federal Reserve System, and outside working at a variety of different private-sector firms.  And after going through the process of extensive interviewing by a large number of people in New York and close consultation with the Chairman and Governor Yellen , there was a very strong consensus that Simon Potter was the right person for the job.  As the Chairman noted, Simon has been the co- head of Research over the past couple of years and been an a ssociate economist for this Committee.  But it is important to underscore the fact that Simon is not just a macroeconomist and monetary policy person.  He has really broadened his knowledge quite a bit beyond macroeconomics.  He did spend a stint in Markets, and he took to it because when the Markets position came open he was strongly interested in the position.  The other thing that he did last year, which I think was really noteworthy and demonstrates his management acumen, was to serve as the point person for writing the Financial Stability Oversight Council’s first Annual Report, which was an extraordinarily challenging assignment because, one, it had never been done before, and, two, you’re herding cats from all the different agencies that all had different views.   That was a pret ty stern test, and Simon passed it with flying colors, which really demonstrates his management acumen.  Obviously, these are big shoes to fill with Brian’s departure, but I am very confident that he will be able to do so very ably. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Tha nk you.  Are there questions for the Vice Chairman? President Fisher. MR. FISHER.  It is not a question, but I just wanted to thank the Vice Chairman for that thorough description.

152,20120801,"July 31–August 1, 20124 of 304monetary policy. In my comments today, I will highlight a few of the more important and potentially contentious issues raised in the memos, starting with the performance of simple rules during what I will nostalgically call “normal times” —that is, times when the effective lower bound on interest rates is not a major consideration. There is a large literature on the performance of simple rules in normal times. It is worth noting that much of the most influential work in this area was performed by current or former Federal Reserve System staff, most notably, President Williams and Andy Levin, along with a number of coauthors.  The background memo by Keith Kuester of the Philadelphia Fed provides a recent summary of the relevant results in a suite  of modern DSGE models.  This body of research identifies several types of rules that generally perform quite well across a range of macroeconomic models.  The serious contenders for your attention are well-represented by the six rules in panel 3, including five rules regularly examined in Tealbook , Book B, plus what we call an inertial Taylor (1999) rule.  The inertial Taylor (1999) rule lies midway between the simple Taylor (1999) rule and the outcome-based rule that is used in generating the Tealbook baseline.  The inertial Taylor rule adds a lagged federal funds rate term to Taylor (1999), but does not include the additional terms in the change in the gap and the change in the policy interest rate that are part of the outcome- based rule.  These six rules  have each been shown to perform generally well, but as the literature makes clear, none of these rules performs flawlessly in all models. I’ll highlight two issues leadi ng to differential performance. As noted in the top panel of exhibit 2, the appropriate measure of the output gap is a contentious issue in theory, and in practice, the output gap is subject to substantial measurement error. All of the rules except the first -difference rule respond to the level of the gap; the first- difference rule largel y sidesteps difficulties measuring the level of the gap by responding only to the change in the gap. Research supports the view that measurement problems may justify reducing the response of policy to the level of the output gap and supports the view that the first difference rule delivers good performance in many models.  On balance, however, totally ignoring the level of the gap probably goes too far.  Large output gaps are particularly costly, and large gaps are likely to be apparent even in the face of realistic measurement problems.  Thus, a rule that responds to the level of the gap tends to provide accommodation when it is most beneficial.  For this reason, research indicates that under realistic measurement error, a significant response to the level of the gap remains appropriate. The second major issue is policy inertia.  The policy prescriptions of all of the rules , except the Taylor (1993) and Taylor (1999) rules , exhibit substantial inertia. For example, the outcome- based rule places a coefficien t of 0.81 on the lagged federal funds rate, implying that the policy prescription in the current quarter is heavily dependent on what was previously prescribed.  The first- difference rule shows even greater inertia, with a coefficient of one on the lagged federal funds rate.  Research indicates that high inertia , such as that in the first -difference rule , can be beneficial in some models, but high inertia can be destabilizing in others.  MoreJuly 31–August 1, 20125 of 304moderate inertia, corresponding to a weight on the lagged funds r ate substantially less than one, seems to perform well across a wide range of models. Under any inertial rule, a change in policy carries the implicit forward guidance that the policy change will be persistent.  In forward-looking models—that is, models in which agents’ decisions depend importantly on long- term interest rates and expected conditions more generally—this persistence gives policy substantial leverage over economic decisions, which can substantially improve stabilization outcomes.  The inertial mechanism works, in part, through occasionally inducing modest overshooting or undershooting of the goals of policy, and because overshooting and undershooting are contentious topics, it may be worth spending a moment on the role this mechanism plays. Attempting to bring, say, unemployment back to target quickly shares some properties with a Washington Nationals baseball player who has just gotten a hit and is attempting to get to first base quickly.  The player can arrive more quickly if he increases h is pace to the point where he must rationally expect to overshoot the bag upon arrival.  The only way to avoid expected (and actual) overshooting is to approach the bag more slowly.  Panel 2 of exhibit 2 illustrates the economic equivalent of this phenomenon.  The figure shows the simulated paths of the unemployment rate as reported in the current Tealbook under the Taylor 1999 rule (the black line) and the nominal income–targeting rule (the red dashed line).  Under the non- inertial Taylor rule, unemploymen t smoothly approaches the NAIRU from above.  Under the nominal income–targeting rule, unemployment approaches the NAIRU at a significantly more rapid pace, and the unemployment rate mildly undershoots the NAIRU beginning in late 2017.  Panel 3 shows the corresponding paths of inflation, with the nominal income–targeting rule (the red dashed line) leading to modest overshooting of inflation—inflation peaks at around 2.2 percent.  Unlike the baseball case, the expected overshooting here plays a crucial role i n bringing about the earlier more-rapid decline in unemployment.  If agents instead expected policy to tighten to avoid overshooting, the anticipated future slowing would damp consumption, hiring, and investment—as with the base runner, avoiding overshooting requires a slower approach.  Note that under the nominal income– targeting rule, inflation and unemployment both spend considerably more time close to their desired values than they do under the Taylor (1999) rule; the conventionally measured welfare gai ns of inertia in this case are substantial. Attaining the benefits from inertia would require the FOMC to credibly follow policies that support modest overshooting and undershooting.  Whether the FOMC could credibly deliver such policy is open to question.  The inertial policies we are discussing here may not, however, put dramatically greater demands on credibility than the demands on credibility posed by the exit principles or the consensus statement regarding longer-run goals and strategy.  Now let us  turn to problems that are uniquely associated with the current policy context, in which the policy rate has been persistently at the effective lower bound.  First, consider how the FOMC’s policy might evolve in the face of typical shocks to the economy if the timing and contour of liftoff were guided by the simple rules.  TheJuly 31–August 1, 20126 of 304evidence we report was generated using a standard stochastic simulation of the FRB/US model, imposing the effective lower bound, and starting with the June Tealbook baseline.  We contrast the results under the inertial Taylor rule, the outcome-based rule, and a modified outcome-based rule.  The modification delays liftoff until two quarters after the unmodified rule initially prescribes it. As noted in panel 4, if the timing and contour of liftoff were guided by the outcome-based rule (the green line), the distribution of likely liftoff dates would be widely dispersed.  There would be more than a 25 percent chance of liftoff coming in 2012 and a similar probability of liftoff coming after mid-2014.  Further, the modal date of liftoff would be very early, in the fourth quarter of 2012.  This is three quarters before the median date of liftoff under this rule and two full years before the liftoff date implied by this rule under the baselin e outlook (not shown).  Clearly, none of these three measures of the likely date of liftoff present s a very complete picture of when liftoff  would actually occur.  In addition, in those cases when the rule prescribes liftoff, say, by 2013: Q1, panel  5 shows that the probability of returning to the effective lower bound within four quarters is very high—above 50 percent. Let me note that the results for the Taylor (1999) rule and first -difference rule are similar to these results report ed for the outcome- based rule. In contrast, the results for the inertial Taylor rule (the blue lines) are quite different.  The distribution of the likely liftoff date in panel 4 remains dispersed, but is more symmetric.  The modal date of liftoff comes a year later than under the outcome-based rule, and the modal date is also closer to this rule’s median liftoff date, which is 2014: Q3. The inertial Taylor rule also shows very little probability of liftoff by early 2013, and in those rare cases when shocks are sufficiently strong to cause early liftoff under this rule, the probability of return to the effective bound within a year, shown in panel 5, is only about 20 percent, much lower than the analogous probability under the outcome- based rule. Finally, note that under the modified outcome- based rule (the green dashed lines), the results are approximately midway between the outcome -based rule and the inertial Taylor rule.  The results for this modified rule are merely meant to illustrate how some fairly modest deviations from some simple rules could yield substantially more appealing outcomes. The results just presented are purely descriptive but hint at possible motives to deviate from simple rules at present.  As noted in the top panel of your final exhibit, it is important to emphasize that existing research does not suggest we should expect the merits of simple rules in normal times to carry over to episodes at the effective lower bound.  Quite to the contrary, the major lesson from the literature is illustrated in the standard optimal policy simulations regularly reported in Tealbook.  Specifically, maintaining accommodation for considerably longer than most simple rules would suggest can have substantial benefits. More generally, there are a number of prominent structural factors operating in the current context that are not accounted for in the research regarding normal times:"
153,20120913,"September 12–13, 20124 of 290Transcript of the Federal Open Market Committee Meeting on September 12 –13, 2012 September 12 Session CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Good morning, everybody.  Our first item is a staff report on the potential effects of large- scale asset purchases.  Seth Carpenter will lead, but Vice Chairman Dudley would like to introduce the other presenter. VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I would like to introduce Michelle Ezer from the Markets Group.  Michelle and I actually had the interesting experience of writing a paper on the case for TIPS , right in the heart of the financial crisis, along with Jennifer Roush. I am not really sure how I managed to do that during that period, but, obviously, Jennifer and Michelle did most of the work.  So she is a coauthor. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay , thank you.  Seth. MR. CARPENTER.1  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I will be referring to the material that’s labeled “Potential Effects of a Large- Scale Asset Purchase Program .”  The Committee received three memos from the staff discussing various aspects of potential new large -scale asset purchase (LSAP) programs.  I will discuss some considerations about how LSAP programs might be structured, and Michelle will discuss the balance sheet and income implications, along with the associated exit issues. When considering the financial and economic effects of LSAPs, the staff analysis starts from a term structure model that embeds Treasury and MBS supply factors as determinants of the yield curve.  These effects depend on market participants’ beliefs about the entire trajectory of the SOMA  portfolio’s holdings of securities and the types of those securities.  The FRB/US model assumes that declines in the 10 -year Treasury yield pass through roughly one- for-one to other market rates. In addition, the lower Treasury rate reduces the discount factor in pricing equities, boosting stock prices.  The foreign exchange value of the dollar falls as well.  For LSAPs that include purchases of MBS, there is an additional assumed reduction in MBS and mortgage rates.  Finally, the changes in these market variables are used to simulate the macroeconomic effects of these purchases using the FRB/US model. Of course, the results depend critically on the models used and a wide set of assumptions, any of which could be challenged.  First, in the staff models, the one-1 The materials used by Mr. Carpenter and Ms. Ezer are appended to this transcript (appendix 1).September 12–13, 20125 of 290for-one pass -through from the 10- year Treasury yield to other market rates could misstate the connection among these rates .  For example, frictions like capacity restrictions for originations may prevent mortgage rates from fully adjusting , at least in the short run.  Another source of uncertainty concerns the embedded effects on equity prices and the foreign exchange value of the dollar.  Some event studies of previous unconventional balance sheet actions point to smaller effects than incorporated into staff analysis.  Finally, the macroeconomic effects of the changes in asset prices are calculated using the FRB/US model, and other models would of course yield results that could be larger or smaller. In short, while the projections represent the staff’s best assessment, the effects are clearly subject to considerable uncertainty. Buying either longer -term Treasury securities or MBS should, in principle, put downward pressure on longer- term interest rates and , so, stimulate the economy. Although staff models suggest that purchases of MBS have a somewhat smaller effect than Treasury purchases on most longer- term interest rates, they have somewhat larger effects on mortgage rates, and when translated into estimated macroeconomic outcomes, the differences are fairly small, especially relative to the substantial uncertainty that surrounds such estimates.  As a result, the staff memos did not provide clear guidance regarding the allocation of LSAPs between purchases of longer- term Treasury securities and purchases of MBS. Looking at your first exhibit, to illustrate the macroeconomic effects that are implied by the staff models, we compare a projection in which the MEP, the Maturity Extension Program, is continued as planned—the solid , dark blue line—to a projection that assumes that the Committee instead ends the MEP and purchases $600 billion in Treasury securities and $400 billion in MBS by late next year .  That’s labeled option 1 as in the staff memo  and it’s the dotted blue line.  In addition to lowering term premiums from LSAPs, this option is also assumed to put downward pressure on longer- term rates by pushing off the first increase in the federal funds rate by about six months.  This LSAP program is projected to boost real GDP, lower the unemployment rate, and increase the inflation rate somewhat.  As a consequence, more rapid progress toward both of the Committee’s goals is made.  The staff memorandum provided prior to your last meeting concluded that the purchases under such a program would not likely lead to a deterioration in market functioning.  Michelle will later discuss some of the anticipated effects of the program on the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and income. As I noted before , the estimated interest rate effect of an LSAP depends on the public’s understanding of the FOMC’s intended plans for purchases and exit.  This consideration is particularly important for a flow -based  or open- ended program that continues until a certain economic outcome is achieved.  If the public understands the FOMC’s stopping rule and has the same forecast for the economy as the Committee, and the economy evolves according to those projections, then our models would suggest that the flow- based LSAP is roughly equivalent to a stock- based LSAP of the same ultimate size.  Of course, the economy would likely not proceed exactly in line with expectations, so under a flow- based LSAP, the anticipated total amount of assetSeptember 12–13, 20126 of 290purchases would likely be more state dependent and evolve as the economy evolves.  Option 4 in the memo entitled “Options for an Additional LSAP Program”— presented here as the dashed red line—was intended to correspond roughly to such a program when the economy faces an adverse shock, and, as a result, purchases end up at a level that is higher than originally assumed. If the ultimate size of purchases in this case is $2 trillion, our models suggest that the net effect would be somewhat smaller than if, from the beginning, a $2 trillion LSAP had been implemented.  However, a flow- based approach, if communicated clearly to the public, also could boost business and consumer confidence by reducing the odds of adverse tail outcomes and limiting the expected variance of economic outcomes.  This confidence effect is not captured in the staf f projections but could be important .  Alternatively, if the stopping rule is not clear, and the public believed that the Committee might stop purchases somewhat earlier than the Committee actually intended, then the interest rate effect could be reduced relative to what our models suggest.  However, a s the public came to understand the Committee’s stopping rule, the expected size of the SOMA portfolio would revise up, and the interest rate effects would become larger.  Michelle is now going to discuss the balance sheet projections and some of the issues related to the exit. MS. EZER. Thanks, Seth.  As Seth mentioned, I will be discussing the balance sheet and income projections described in the LSAP options memo and associated exit issues.   I plan to focus on the same two LSAP options Seth discussed, though the memo presented several options.  Turning to the top-left panel of exhibit 2, you can see the path of the portfolio under a baseline scenario in which MEP is completed and options 1 and 4 from the memo.  Under the latter two options, the portfolio grows significantly as a result of the asset purchases. Consistent with the exit principles, we assume that 6 months prior to the first increase in the target federal funds rate, securities are allowed to mature without reinvestment, and 6 months after that first increase, sales of agency securities begin. These actions normalize the size of the portfolio through time.  The addition of a new LSAP program extends the period of time between the start of asset sales and when the portfolio normalizes in size. For example, under option 1 it takes 41 months for the portfolio size to normalize after the initiation of MBS sales.   This is 6 months longer compared with the MEP scenario. In terms of Federal Reserve income, cumulative remittances to the Treasury over the projection period are lower than in a scenario with no additional LSAP.  The lower remittances reflect higher inte rest expense and the larger capital losses from MBS sales. Looking at the top-right panel, until 2016, remittances are higher under the LSAP scenarios, because of the higher interest income from the larger portfolio and minim al additional interest expense.  Thereafter, income is lower as a result of higher interest expense and larger capital losses. Under option 1, annual remittances are projected to bottom out near zero.  By contrast, under option 4, remittances fall to zero for more than 5 years, and a deferred asset is created.

I will ask Eric Engen to make a presentation , we’ll ask some questions, and then we’ll do a go-round and see what the views are on this issue.  So let me turn it over to Eric. MR. ENGEN.1  Thank you.  I will be referring to the handout titled “Material for Briefing on Thresholds,” which  has been distributed. In a memo circulated to the Committee last week, the staff analyzed the merits of replacing or augmenting the current date- based forward guidance with specific threshold values of inflation and unemployment that would need to be attained before policymakers would consider increasing the federal funds rate target.  As outlined in the top panel of the first exhibit, you may be concerned that the current forward guidance could lead market participants to focus on the expected date of liftoff rather than the conditionality of the outlook for the f unds rate target and so leave the impression that the Committee has committed to a specific time -dependent policy.  By contrast, quantitative thresholds could increase the clarity of the Committee’s intentions and improve market participants’ understanding of the monetary policy reaction function.  In particular, thresholds could enable market participants to obtain a better understanding of how the onset of policy firming might shift in response to changes in the economic outlook.  Such guidance may make i t more likely that market responses to economic developments would move longer- term interest rates in a direction and by an amount consistent with the Committee’s view regarding the likely future path of short- term rates.  Enhanced clarity about the Committee’s intentions might also reduce uncertainty about the future stance of policy.  In both ways, thresholds could therefore contribute to improved macroeconomic performance. As indicated by the second bullet, the adoption of thresholds could also facilitat e the Committee’s deliberations.  With the current date -based forward guidance, the Committee must regularly review the date to verify that it is still appropriate —a review that can be contentious because participants have different views about the economic outlook and about the appropriate date for the onset of policy firming.  In principle, thresholds could allow participants with different outlooks to agree on the statement’s forward guidance and to do so in a way that needs to be reviewed only from time to time. Finally, the announcement of a thresholds strategy might provide additional policy stimulus if it were to materially change market expectations for the future path of the federal funds rate, both with regard to the date when policy would begin to firm and the subsequent pace of tightening. The bottom panels of the exhibit illustrate both the limits and the force of this last point.  The September consensus forecast is plotted as the black lines, and let’s 1 The materials used by Mr. Engen are appended to this transcript (appendix 1).October 23–24, 20125 of 279assume that market expectations are curren tly in line with this baseline forecast.  We then assume that the FOMC credibly promises to keep the funds rate near zero as long as the unemployment rate is above 6½ percent and inflation is projected to remain below 2 ½ percent, but once either threshold is crossed, it will follow the prescriptions of the outcome-based rule.  As shown by the red lines, because this strategy implies essentially the same path for the funds rate as in the baseline, it has almost no effect on real activity or inflation.  However, if the Committee were to announce the more aggressive threshold strategy, denoted by the green lines, in which the unemployment threshold is 5½ percent and the inflation threshold is 3 percent, then the date when policy firming begins would be postponed by a year, resulting in lower unemployment and higher inflation. The blue lines illustrate a somewhat different point—that forward guidance about the Committee’s strategy for the pace of tightening after liftoff also can have an important effect on the economy.  Here, the Committee announces the same moderate threshold settings of 6½ percent for unemployment and 2½ percent for inflation as were imp licit in the red lines, but also credibly promises to tighten more slowly than market participants initially anticipate by following the more gradual prescriptions of an inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule.  As can be seen, this strategy does about as well as the more aggressive threshold strategy in providing additional policy stimulus. These simulation results are not general, because they show only the performance of the different threshold settings and policy rules given the underlying economic conditions of the September consensus forecast.  As outlined at the beginning of the top panel in the second exhibit, for this reason we undertook a more comprehensive analysis of threshold settings and policy rules when the economy—as approximated by the F RB/US model—is buffe ted by a wide range of shocks. Subject to the usual caveats that necessarily apply to any model -based analysis, two main lessons emerged from this exercise .  First, the model simulations suggest that the Committee could use thresholds t o help clarify its communications without compromising macroeconomic performance.  In particular, using projected inflation and unemployment thresholds to guide the return to a “normal” policy setting—as approximated by having the federal funds rate follow the prescriptions of a simple policy rule after either of the thresholds is crossed—would likely perform fairly well under a variety of economic conditions.  Second, the model simulations suggest that the use of thresholds could improve expected macroeconomic performance —subject to the caveat that thresholds can be set too aggressively. I should note that we explored the effects of more threshold combinations than we reported in the memo, and that one of these followed President Kocherlakota’s proposal to set the unemployment threshold at 5½ percent and the inflation threshold at 2½ percent.  Although we found that these settings worked well in many circumstances, we ran into technical obstacles in solving the model with them in our stochastic simulations and so did not include this case in our analysis.October 23–24, 20126 of 279We also investigated some issues that arise when thresholds are defined in terms of the unemployment rate and projected inflation, where two important conclusions emerged. First, because the am ount of slack in labor markets is uncertain, reliance on an unemployment threshold creates a risk that the Committee could keep policy persistently easier or tighter than it would choose to if it had full information about the economy.  However, this risk is associated with any policy strategy that uses measures of labor  market slack to help guide the setting of the funds rate, and the use of thresholds may not exacerbate it greatly.  Moreover, the consequences of such measurement error would probably be modest provided that inflation expectations remained reasonably well anchored and the Committee corrected its error once it saw inflation rising substantially above its target. Second, because inflation—even projected inflation—is subject to a certain degree of inherent volatility, setting the inflation threshold at a level only modestly above 2 percent would make it highly likely that this threshold would be crossed relatively early despite a still-elevated level of unemployment.  As a result, economic outcomes could be less favorable than those obtained with a somewhat higher inflation threshold. We also considered some of the communications challenges that would likely be associated with using a thresholds strategy in the Committee’s forward guidance.  One challenge is that it’ s difficult to formulate a threshold for inflation in terms of the realized headline inflation rate because headline inflation is volatile and often buffeted by significant but transitory shocks, particularly from oil and other commodity prices.  A second challenge is that the effect of monetary policy on current financial and economic conditions depends at least as much on market participants’ expectations for policy after the onset of policy firming as on the expected start date of fi rming.  A third challenge arises because the thresholds would likely differ from the Committee’s longer -run objectives and market participants may not understand the distinction.  Finally, the use of a threshold strategy would describe monetary policy in terms of two variables, but the Committee draws on a wide range of indicators when setting monetary policy.  Our memo provided possible statement language that would address some of these communications challenges.  That langu age is reproduced  on exhibit 3 of your handout. The last page of the handout provides the questions for discussion that were distributed to you last week, which you may want to refer to in your remarks.  I would now be glad to take any questions that you have. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you very much.  Are there any questions for the staff?  President Bullard. MR. BULLARD.  Yes.  Thanks for the presentation.  I’m looking at the “Federal Funds Rate” picture on exhibit 1.  The green here, the outcome- based rule , has the liftoff date in the"
155,20121212,"December 11–12, 20124 of 260As seen in your middle-left panel, investors have pushed out the expected timing of increases in the federal funds rate.  The market is now pricing a higher likelihood that the target federal funds rate will not begin to rise until late 2015 or early 2016.  The outcome of the election reinforced investors’ expectations for a continuation of highly accommodative monetary policy. Investors are also i ncreasingly focused on the possibility that the Committee could introduce economic thresholds in its forward rate guidance.  According to the primary dealer survey, the odds for such an announcement at this meeting appear quite low, given that the October meeting minutes noted a number of practical issues that would first need to be addressed.  As seen in your middle- right panel, dealers assigned an average probability of about 1 in 10 to thresholds being announced at this meeting .  The probability increases over the course of the following two meetings.  Of the many dealers who provided estimates for quantitative thresholds, most cited a 6.5 percent unemployment rate and a 2.5 percent  inflation r ate as the most likely choices. Returning to fiscal policy, in  the primary dealer survey, we asked respondents to assign probabilities to the three fiscal policy scenarios laid forth by the CBO in November.  As seen in the bottom-left panel, dealers assigned the highest likelihood to the compromise “Alternative Scenario” and believed that such a scenario would have little effect on 10 -year Treasury yields .  In contrast, the dealers believe that if fiscal policy were to follow the other two scenarios—“C urrent Law” or “No F iscal Restraint ”—the effect on 10-year yields w ould be substantial. Pricing in the options market does not reflect significant investor expectations for volatility in broader asset prices as fiscal policy negotiations continue .  The lower -right panel shows prices of out-of-the-money strangles on the S&P 500 and the euro-dollar currency pair.  These structures pay off if there are meaningful moves in the price of the underlying in either direction.  However, the current low strangle prices would appear to indicate that investors are not seeking protection against or positioning for a sharp increase in volatility. Your second exhibit begins with developments in domestic credit markets.  As I noted in my last briefing, spreads to Treasuries for a broad range of credit assets have declined steadily in light of recent monetary policy actions as well as sharply reduced perceptions of European tail risk.  Despite some credit spread widening after the election, these underlying factors continue to support very strong investor demand for credit assets .  Evidencing this strong demand, investment- grade spreads have widened only modestly, even amid very heavy corporate debt issuance.  As can be seen in the top-right panel, the pace of investment- grade debt issuance has accelerated recently, and annual issuance through November was already well above last year’s pace.  Heavy issuance partly reflects a desire to move ahead of any potential market volatility related to fiscal policy negotiations .  In addition, some firms expect to use proceeds to finance special dividend payments before possibl e tax rate increases next year.December 11–12, 20125 of 260Turning to foreign markets, investors are closely following political developments in Japan and their implications for monetary policy .  The likely prime minister following the upcoming election has advocated a significantly more accommodative monetary policy.  This development has led to a sharp rise in Japanese stocks and an approximately 3 percent depreciation of the yen against the dollar, as seen in the middle -left panel .  Intermediate - and longer-dated risk reversals have risen to their highest levels on record, reflecting increased  demand for protection ag ainst further yen depreciation. In Europe, two -year German yields have returned to negative levels on growing concerns about the outlook for economic growth in core Europe and increasing expectations that the ECB could lower its policy rates in the months ahead, possibly moving its deposit rate below zero .  This change can be seen in your middle- right panel .  The increasing focus on economic weakn ess also pressured the euro lower against the dollar, particularly earl ier in the period.  Improved sentiment following the passing of several risk events in the periphery, as Steve Kamin will discuss in his briefing, has offset some of this pressure. The bottom-left panel touches on expectations for money market conditions around the year- end.  A number of special factors this year may be causing January and February bills to trade at low rates relative to December bills .  First, as discussed in the box “Expiration of Unlimited FDIC Deposit Insurance” in Tealbook A, many investors believe that the year-end expiration of the FDIC’s unlimited guarantee on noninterest-bearing transaction accounts could lead to outflows from these accounts and into money market instruments.  The potential for tighter fiscal policy may also be affecting early -2013 bill rates, because spending cuts and higher tax rates could reduce the government ’s short -term funding needs.  Lastly, the anticipated end of the maturity extension program, or MEP , could also put downward pressure on money market rates .  The end of dealer purchases of short- dated Treasuries in the MEP, which tend to be financed in the repo market, could lead to reduced demand for repo funding and a decline in rates for repo transactions and close substitutes, including bills. Before moving to Desk operations, I would like to discuss Hurricane Sandy’s effect on money markets.  As seen in the bottom- right panel, interdealer MBS and Treasury repo rates increased sharply the day the storm made landfall, as dealers sought to lock in funding early.  Rates remained elevated for a few days due to staffing and other operational constraints at dealers and interdealer brokers but then declined to more typical levels .  In contrast, rates in the federal funds market were little affected.  Under the current directive, the Desk could conduct RP operations if it believed that the effective federal funds rate would move above 25 basis points in the absence of such operations .  We were alert to this possibility given the spike in general collateral rates but did not act , as the effective rate was expected to remain well within the target range due to the high level of excess reserves.  This situation raises the question of whether an unusual level of repo rates alone should warrant Desk operations in some special cases.December 11–12, 20126 of 260Your next exhibit focuses on Desk operations and policy expectations.  Under the MEP, the Desk has purchased just over $635 billion  of longer- term Treasury securities and sol d or allowed to redeem without reinvestment a slightly larger amount.  If directed to complete the MEP, we would have just three sales and nine purchase operations to complete before the end of the year. The MEP operations have resulted in a significant shift in SOMA holdings of Treasury securities in different maturity sectors, increasing the average duration of the portfolio.  As shown in the upper-left panel, SOMA holdings at the completion of MEP (the dark blue bars) will stand at 35 percent of all outs tanding securities in the 10- to 30- year sector, compared with about 15 percent before the crisis  (as seen in the red bars ), and we will have sold out of nearly every security maturing within 3 years. If the FOMC directed the Desk to continue Treasury pur chases in January, the staff would propose a purchase distribution with an average duration of approximately 9 years, which is the net duration of the MEP sales and purchases. We purchased $110 billion  in agency MBS during the intermeeting period.  Indicators of market function continue to be little affected by the increased size of our purchases .  As described in a memo distributed to the Committee, the staff currently assesses  that a continuation of additional MBS purchases at $40 billion  per month through 2013 is unlikely to cause significant market functioning issues.  As you can see in the top -right panel, the size of settlements increased from an average of $27 billion under the reinvestment program to $64 billion  in November.  Despite the increase, these settlements went smoothly.  Of the expected settlements in December, to date, about $9 billion  have been moved out to January through dollar roll operations.  Though this monthly dollar roll amount is our highest since reinvestments began, it represents about 10 percent of expected settlements, which is well within the range of dollar roll activity seen in the last year. Given the increase in the size of our settlements, we are monitoring indicators of market functioning closely.  One such indicator is the implied financing rates on newly produced MBS, which measure, among other things, the expected scarcity of these securities for settlement.  As shown in the middle -left panel, the implied financing rates for December and January settlement of the Fannie Mae 3 percent coupon—the main production coupon—have moderated.  This could partly be due to financial institutions’ desire to manage balance sheet ahead of year -end, along with higher- than-anticipate d origination volumes contributing to an increase in the supply of MBS available for settlement in December. Implied financing rates for the 3.5 percent coupon, where we conducted dollar rolls this month, have been more negative, likely reflecting the fact that production in this coupon has begun to wane.  If widespread strains were to emerge in production coupons, the Desk is prepared to respond by increasing dollar roll acti vity to facilitate settlement. Since the announcement of the additional MBS purchases, production coupon MBS yields and spreads have declined.  Primary rates have also fallen and are around record lows.  However, MBS option-adjusted spreads on the main production coupon have retraced somewhat in recent weeks, as shown in the middle- right panel, with"

This being January, this is our annual organizational meeting.  So let me be the first to welcome Presidents Bullard, Evans, George, and Rosengren to the Committee.   The first item on the agenda is the election of Committee officers.  I need a nomination for Chairman. MS. YELLEN.  I would like to move the nomination of Ben Bernanke as Chairman.

[No response ]  January 29–30, 20134 of 269Without objection.  Thank you.  Item 3 is the selection of a Manager  for the SOMA.  Simon Potter has indicated he’s willing to serve.   Questions?  [No response ]  Without objection.  Thank you.  The Federal Reserve Bank of New York will have to formally approve that as well.  What are the odds there, Bill? VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Pretty good.  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Item 4, “P roposed Revisions to the Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations.”  These were circulated in a January 23 memo from Simon Potter.  A couple of revisions are proposed.  Simon, would you like to briefly describe them? MR. POTTER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  At its first meeting each year, the Committee reviews the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations, the Foreign Currency Directive and related procedural instructions, and the Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations.  With regard to the domestic open market operations, I recommend that the authorization be renewed with two changes. The first proposed change entails a broadening of the authority under paragraph 6.  As currently draf ted, the Domestic Authorization authorizes and directs the Desk, on instruction of the Chairman, “to adjust . . . the degree of pressure on reserve positions and hence the intended federal funds rate.”  This authority enables the Chairman to take action du ring an intermeeting period , when it is not feasible to consult with the full Committee before action is needed.  With the current high level of excess reserves, it is possible that U.S. dollar funding markets may be disrupted in a manner that does not dir ectly affect reserve positions or the federal funds rate.  Given that this is the case, I am requesting that the authorization be altered in order to allow the Chairman to instruct the Desk to undertake open market operations to address such market disruptions in exceptional circumstances.  For example, if, as a result of a natural disaster, secured funding rates increased to high levels while the federal funds rate remained within the target range, there could be a risk of a broader, more systemic disruption to the functioning of asset markets.  In this case, conducting repurchase operations with dealers could potentially alleviate such market strains  and warrant immediate action.  The second proposed change is to address an inconsistency in the language describing the Committee’s long -run objectives as stated in the Domestic Authorization relative to those stated in the FOMC statement, the Committee’s public statement of its longer -run goals, and s ection 2A of the Federal Reserve Act.  As is, the Domestic Au thorization refers to “ the Committee’s long -run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth” rather than “to foster maximum employment and price stability.”   I recommend a change to the language of the Domestic Authorization to the latter clause to be consistent with these statements.  January 29–30, 20135 of 269In addition to these changes, I would also like to update the Committee on two items related to the Domestic Authorization.  First, as you know, the System Open Market Account contains a significant amount of agency debt and agency MBS, and it continues to conduct transactions in MBS securities as part of the ongoing purchase program as well as the reinvestment policy adopted by the Committee.  As such, I recommend a continued suspension of the Guidelines for the Conduct of System Operations in Federal Agency Issues.  Second, the current authorization allows the Desk to utilize third -party agents, such as asset managers and custodian banks, in its agency MBS operations.  Although the Desk conducts all agency M BS trading internally, we continue to require services for a variety of clearing, settlement, custodial, and analytical activities , and thus the language about the use of agents in the authorization remains necessary at this time.  No Committee vote is needed related to these two actions.  Turning to foreign currency operations, the Desk conducts such operations under the terms of the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations, the Foreign Currency Directive, and the Procedural Instructions with Respect to Foreign Currency Operations.  I recommend that the Committee approve the Foreign Currency Directive as it currently stands.  However, I recommend that the Committee approve the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations and the Procedural Instructions with Respect to Foreign Currency Operations with one amendment to each.  Please note that the vote to reaffirm these documents will include approval of the System’s warehousing agreement with the Treasury . The proposed amendments to the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations and the Procedural Instructions with Respect to Foreign Currency Operations would allow the Desk to undertake small -value operations against the full range of foreign transactions that the Desk is authorized to conduct.  This change would be made for the purpose of allowing for prudent testing of operational readiness and is similar in purpose to the amendment that the Committee approved to the FRBNY’s Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations in June 2012.  The change would cover small- value currency swap operations with foreign c entral banks, including those to facilitate provision of U.S. dollar liquidity to c entral c ounterparties abroad, as described in an October 2012 note to the FOMC.  Small- value transactions of this type would help ensure that no technical obstacles exist should such facilities need to be activated.  The proposal also establishes that the Desk will provide notice to the Committee prior to conducting such transactions and limits the total amount of these transactions to $2.5 billion per year.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Let’s break these up.  Item 4  is the Authorization for D omestic Open M arket Operations.  As Simon mentioned, there are two proposed revisions:  O ne is to give the Chairman the ability to respond to extraordinary circumstances in funding markets, and the second is really just a languag e change to harmonize January 29–30, 20136 of 269"
157,20130320,"FOMC, you should let me know that as well.  I don’t think that we need to have an extensive discussion today, but surely those recommendations are on the table at this point.  Although we sent you a summary, more information is available.  I f you ’d like to know more about the investigation , if you have specific questions or concerns, please feel free to talk to Bill or Scott.  Let me say one other thing.  Thank you to Bill and Scott for the tremendous amount of work they did.  It took them quite a long time, and, as you know, they do have a few other things to worry about.  So we appreciate their serious and determined efforts.  Questions for me or for Scott and Bill?  Governor Raskin. MS. RASKIN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I, too, want to commend our FOMC s ecretary and FOMC g eneral counsel for conducting their review.  I very much appreciate the diligence that they brought to the task and the seriousness of purpose.  I did note in the review that they provided to us that there really was no explicit reference to the Program for Security of FOMC Information, which is, as I understand it, our touchstone.  This is where our rules on confidentiality are embedded .  I guess it makes sense that we have these rules embedded , because, obviously, we conduct our deliber ations here with a particular privilege of confidentiality, and we value those deliberations and the ability to deliberate in the way we do.  I want to really underscore the importance of this Program for Security because it permits us to, in essence, enfo rce our own rules .  We have set out rules for when we have potential unauthorized disclosures like we may have had in this last incident.  So , because I value —I think we all value—our ability to conduct deliberations the way we do, I am glad that we have this policy.  And with that privilege in mind, I guess I wanted to ask, as a point of process, both Bill and Scott whether , when they conducted their review, they conformed the review to the processes set forth in the Program for Security of FOMC Informatio n. March 19–20, 20134 of 322MR. ENGLISH.  I believe we did.  The p rogram ask s that we conduct a review and then confer with the Chairman, which is the process that we followed.  Scott , do you want to say anything further ? MR. ALVAREZ.  S o, that’s exactly right.  We did look beyond just the release of confidential information to compliance with the policy itself, which imposes some extra discipline on participants and staff. MS. RASKIN.  Thank you.  Yes, I noticed that what the policy says is that “ the Secretary and the FOMC’s Gener al Counsel will perform an initial review of the incident. ”  That was what you did, the “initial review of the incident, in consultation with the Chairman,” which occurred, “and with the P resident of a specific Federal Reserve Bank if the violation appears to have involved staff within that Bank.”  So t hat is what this is.   I go on to read, “In light of that initial review, the General Counsel will determine whether to request the Board’s Inspector General to perform a full investigation of the incident.”  Was that piece followed as well? MR. ALVAREZ.  Sure.  We provided a very extensive report to the Chairman explaining all of the review that we did, much more detailed than the summary that has been provided to the Committee.   Bill and I have discussed whether further investigation is appropriate or whether this matter should be referred to the IG.  My recommendation was that it not be formally recommended to the IG, because I think the review that we did uncovered as much as could be uncovered.  The IG does not have special tools that would allow them to get more information than we were able to get.   And given that most of the information in this case was the result of phone calls and interviews and not a records-based kind of process, we thought that we were able to conduct about as extensive and detailed a review as possible.  So that was the basis for my recommendation.  The Chairman has to make a decision about whether there’s disciplina ry March 19–20, 20135 of 322action that should be taken here at the Board or by the presidents at the Reserve Banks.  That’s a separate matter .  But that i s my view . CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Governor Tarullo. MR. TARULLO. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  This, as you said, is not the place to have a discussion of the substantive recommendations, but I do have some concerns about some of the substantive recommendations, mostly springing from what I think might be a quite de facto differential application of them to people without personal staffs as opposed to people who do have personal staffs, which is a bit of a presidents/Governors distinction.  And so maybe there could be some forum or opportunity for an elaboration of some of those comments, whether in Janet’s subcommittee or elsewhere.  CHA IRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, Michelle has agreed to work with Bill and Scott in implementing this, and perhaps they can address the specific questions that you have.  I guess I don’t think we’re ready to have a determination here, but if the general sense of the Committee is that we’d like to refer these recommendations to Janet’s subcommittee and if Janet is willing, then over the next few meetings, we can fine-tune them and incorporate them into the policy.  You don’t seem happy, Governor. MR. TARULLO.  No, I’m not, but that’s okay. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I guess I don’t understand the issue. MR. TARULLO.  Well, I was trying to avoid being too explicit about it— CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Ah, you were successful. MR. TARULLO.  —but I guess I’ll get explicit about it.   The issue is that , in short, when one is dealing with the press or a member of Congress or anybody outside the organization and one is staffed, the question becomes, who is the staff responsible to, and who are they supposed March 19–20, 20136 of 322"
158,20130501,"April 30–May 1, 20134 of 240Reserve, BOJ, ECB,  and Bank of England ( BOE ), as a percent of GDP, at the end of 2012 and a projection for year-end 2014.  The BOJ’s announced purchases are projected to leave the central bank’s holdings considerably above the level of currency in circulation, and above that projected for both the BOE ’s and Federal Reserve’s  holdings relative to currency. The middle-right panel contrasts the maturity profile of central banks’ sovereign debt portfolios relative to the overall market.  While the SOMA portfolio’s weighted average maturity —or WAM —is shorter than the BOE ’s, it is significantly above the WAM of the Treasury market as a whol e.  In contrast, BOJ purchases of JGBs have traditionally been of much shorter maturity than the overall JGB market.  Under the BOJ’s announced purchase plan, the WAM of its portfolio is projected to be close to the WAM of the overall JGB market by year-end 2014. While investors were expecting some shift of purchases to longer- dated JGBs, the size of the shift was significantly larger than had been expected .  As seen in the lower -left panel, yields on 10-year and 30- year JGBs initially declined 12 to 30 bas is points.  Subsequently, JGB yields have retraced, though, on net, 10- year and 30 -year yields remain 15 to 30 basis point s below their late -February levels, when expectations for longer- duration asset purchases began to firm .  There is likely a range of contributing factors to the retracement, though it is difficult to quantify them or even rank their importance: It may reflect uncertainty about the appropriate level of rates under the new policy regime, given the size of purchases and the BOJ’s stated intent of achieving 2 percent inflation .  Since the new easing measures were introduced, 1-year inflation compensation 2 years forward derived from inflation swaps has risen by only 20 basis point s and remains well below the new 2 percent objective.  However , given modest trading activity, these and other market- based inflation measures might not accurately reflect a sh ift in inflation expectations. The recent rise in JGB yields may also reflect market concerns about the smooth implementation of such sizable asset purchases .  Initially, the BOJ announced that it would conduct purchases on just six days per month with minimal guidance on the maturity ranges of purchase operations .  The small number of operations also implied very large operation sizes , given both the size of net new purchases and ongoing reinvestment. Market participants have suggested that these operational parameters , along with the surprise on size, contributed to a significant deterioration in market functioning.  Bid–asked spreads in the JGB market widened by many multiples of typical levels , and, as seen in the bottom- right panel, intraday volatility on 10 -year JGBs spiked.  The BOJ eventually provided more clarity about its expected purchases and increased the number of days on which it would operate, which will lead to reduced operation sizes in most maturity sectors .  These measures contributed to an improvement in market functioning over the last two weeks, with intraday volatility and bid–asked spreads declining back toward mor e normal levels.  However, as yields have not declined as these measures of market functioning have improved, the contribution of implementation issues to the recent rise in yields remains unclear.April 30–May 1, 20135 of 240Your second exhibit begins with developments in global sovereign debt markets.  Here, too, the BOJ policy action remains a focal point for investors.  Many have noted that institutional Japanese investors, including firms in the ¥400 trillion life insurance industry, may increase their allocation to foreign marke ts.  Investors suggest that increased bond allocations would likely be to high-quality sovereign markets such as the U nited S tates, Australia, and core European countries, though emerging market economies are also expected to see some inflows .  To date, fe w such reallocations have been reported, though a number of Japanese life insurance companies have noted intentions to boost allocations to foreign bonds. Anticipation of these flows has contributed to a notable decline in sovereign debt yields, as seen in  the upper- left panel .  However, the recent weakening of economic data has also contributed to lower yields.  Indeed, as seen in the top-right panel, in the primary dealer survey, respondents viewed weaker growth as the most important factor behind the decline in the 10- year Treasury yield. The pattern of 1- year forward rate changes, seen in the middle- left panel, indicates that most of the decline in the 10 -year Treasury yield was associated with a sharp fall in longer- dated real forward rates .  Most of the change in the real long forward rates occurred after the BOJ  announcement.  This period also included a number of weak U.S. data points, including the March employment report, so it is likely that shifting balance sheet expectations as well as anticipate d portfolio rebalancing by Japanese invest ors contributed to the decline. As shown in the red line of the middle-right panel, measures of inflation compensation at long horizons were relatively stable.  Five- year forward , five -year inflation breakevens declined only modestly and remain in the middle of the range seen since last September .  As shown in the dark blue line, oil prices declined over the period, in part because of  signs of slowing growth in China that Ste ve Kam in will discuss further. There was also a precipitous decline in spot gold prices over the period, which appears largely related to concerns that peripheral euro -area countries could sell a portion of their gold holdings.  Exchange-traded gold trusts, which have grown into a very popular investment vehicle in recent years, proved resilient amid the sharp price declines and vastly increased trading volumes. Turning to Europe, weaker economic data has led to a firming of expectations for a cut to the ECB’s ma in refinancing rate, as can be seen in the bottom- left panel .  The EONIA rate, which reflects overnight interbank borrowing for the largest European banks, remains well below the main refinancing rate.  However, a cut to the refinancing rate could still se rve to promote more-accommodative funding market conditions for peripheral banks. As shown in the bottom-right panel, both Italian and Spanish 10- year debt spreads to German debt narrowed over the period.  Events in Cyprus appear to have had little sustain ed impact on financial markets .  Still, investors noted that the terms of theApril 30–May 1, 20136 of 240Cyprus program are consistent with some euro-area officials’ objective of expanding private-sector loss sharing in bank restructurings.  In addition, the use of capital controls for the first time in the euro area could increase the likelihood of depositor and investor flight from other countries seen as at risk of future bank or sovereign restructurings. Your third exhibit turns to Desk operations.  In the Treasury market, the Desk is continuing to receive good participation in the purchase operations.  One recent trend we are monitoring, which is shown in the upper-left panel, is the decline in bid- to-cover ratios, particularly in the 20- to-30-year sector.  With the conclusion of the MEP sales’ operations, we reduced the size of each operation given the increase in number of days available for purchases.  With smaller auctions, we saw an increase in the size of offers relative to the auction amounts; however, that trend has reversed, though the coverage level remains healthy and above ranges seen over the course of the MEP. Overall, we have not seen any notable shifts in Treasury market functioning during the intermeeting period , with both bid–asked  spreads and trading volumes r emaining in historical ranges , but we will continue to monitor auction performance to see if any adjustments in the operation schedule are warranted. In the MBS market, the Desk continues to concentrate purchases in production coupons.  As shown in the upper -right panel, issuance, and thus our purchases, remain s concentrated largely in the 30 -year 3 percent coupon.  The bars to the right of that same panel show our projections for MBS purchases as a percent of gross TBA issuance using the March and current Tealbook baseline rate paths.  These projections of purchases as a percentage of gross issuance have shifted d own given the decline in rates. While gross TBA issuance is a useful proxy for the most liquid supply of MBS available for purchase, it is important not to view it as an absolute limit.  This is because the TBA trading convention allows both newly issued and existing securities to be delivered into transactions.  In a TBA transaction, the seller typically delivers the cheapest -to-deliver MBS, irrespective of whether that security is newly issued. As a result of this dynamic, each month we are delivered both newly issued MBS and securities that were produced some time ago .  This is reflected in the age of the loans backing the securities we are being  delivered, seen in the middle- left panel .  Most of the MBS we receive are backed by recently originated loans, which we define as having a weighted average loan age of zero  to three months.  However, for some coupons like the 30-year 3.5 percent, the cheapest -to-deliver securities were issued several months ago. The ability to deliver both new and existing MBS in the TBA market is one reason we believe purchases can exceed gross TBA issuance without causing significant market dysfunction.  As you can s ee in the middle -right panel, a sizable amount of production coupon MBS has been produced in the last year, providing a source for additional MBS purchases.  That said, it is possible that purchasing from the stock of recently issued MBS will prove more difficult than purchases from new issuance because investors will be less willing to sell their existing holdings."
159,20130619,"Transcript of the Federal Open Market Committee Meeting  on June 18–19, 2013  June 18 Session   CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Good afternoon, everyone.  President Pianalto is not able to join us today.  She has a family emergency.  Greg Stefani, First Vice President, Cleveland, will be taking her chair.  We’re sorry about the circumstances, but welcome to the meeting.  On a slightly better note, this is the last meeting for David Reifschneide r.  Dave has attended 65 FOMC meetings.  Even more impressively than that, he has authored or coauthored more than 50 memos that have been distributed to all of you for your edification, and I think it is worth pointing out that Shakespeare only wrote 39 plays.  [Laughter] .  David’s forward guidance is that he will be lifting  off sometime in 2013:Q3, but the a lt sims put the 70  percent confidence range at anywhere between tomorrow and 2017.  [Laughter]  David, you are a Federal Reserve institution.  We’ll miss you as a colleague and as a friend , and congratulations on the new stage.  [Applause] Before we get to the regular agenda, I have a couple of items I want to talk about briefly.  First, after some discussions, R&S would like to do an experiment with Tealbook, Book A, for the next meeting.  The idea is to present the D omestic Economic Developments and Outlook section  in a more concise bullet -like form that would be, we hope, better structured and more usable by readers and would spare the R& S staff many , many late hours trying to figure out exactly the right adjective in their prose.   [Laughter]  David Wilcox, who is here, of course, assures me that this is only an expositional experiment, that there will be no skimping on data analysis, the forecast rou nd, or any of those critical inputs.  So we’ll see how that works.  We’re going to try it for July, and, depending on feedback, we could continue that or not.  T his is my own commentary :  The Board members have seen something called the “ Wascher notes ,” which June 18–19, 20134 of 233is a very short summary of the forecast, and found those very useful.  T his is essentially what we’re trying to accomplish.   This is just an experiment.  We will be soliciting your reactions.  If you have any early comments or questions, David Wilcox will be happy to respond.  Any questions or comments?  [No response] The second item I want to mention briefly.  In previous meetings we’ve had a good bit of discussion about the exit principles.  As you know, in June of 2011, in our minutes we put out a somewhat formal set of principles about how we would normalize our balance sheet in the longer term.  We’ve had some discussion about whether or not we could update those principles.  I think on most elements there was a good bit of agreement, but as the memo you got suggested, we really weren’t able to come to a full agreement on a new set of bulleted principles to put out immediately.   A few people objected, in particular, to the idea that MBS sales would not be an early part of the exit strategy, and a few others were concerned mostly about the timing, that putting it out now would be perhaps a bad signal about our imminent exit from accommodative policies.  So we were not able to get, at this point, the kind of agreement we had in 2011 where I think we had only one dissent.  What I’d like to do first, of course, is to continue working on this.  As we get closer to the appropriate time, we’ll need to have clarification, and the markets and the public will like to have clarification.  For now, the memo that  was circulated suggested four summary points, which I’ll read to you in just a moment in case you don’t have them .  What I propose to do in my press conference is to have a short paragraph that says :  We’re working on this, here are some of the things tha t we see, w e’ll be back to you when we have more information, but we don’t have a full update at this point; in addition, any conversations we have now, obviously, as  we’ve done before, will be June 18–19, 20135 of 233reflected in the minutes in the usual minutes style, which presents different points of view, and so on. For your recollection, the four points that were in the memo that w as sent to you—O ne:  “Meeting participants generally continue d to view the broad principles released in the minutes of the June 2011 FOMC meeting as appropriate. ”  That’s the whole sentence.  We were thinking in terms of the use of the IOER,  the funds rate target, reserve draining tools , et cetera. Two:  “H owever, participants agreed that the details of the eventual normalization process likely would differ from those specified two years ago, and that the Committee would need to provide additional information about its intentions closer to the time when normalization becomes appropriate. ” Three—and this is the one about MBS; I think it reflects both sides here:  “While participants continued to think that the Federal Reserve should hold predominantly Treasury securities in the long run, a substantial majority of participants now anticipate that the Committee will not sell MBS as part of the normalization process, except that, in the longer run, limited sales could be used to reduce or eliminate residual holdings.”  That, I think, reflects the balance of views there, but I’ll open the floor in a second. Finally, four :  “The Committee’s current focus is on providing monetary accommodation to promote a stronger economic recovery, and so the Committee judged that additional discussion of policy normalization should be deferred.”  Again, those were the principles that were circulated.  I recognize, exactly as I said at the beginning, that we don’t all agree on a full set of principles.  Is there any concern about how we propose to proceed?  An y comments?  President Lacker.

160,20130731,"communications at the JEC testimony and June FOMC meeting that investors interpreted as pointing to a less accommodative stance of monetary policy.  These developments led to a substantial and abrupt pullback across many global markets from trading strategies that had been predicated on a low and stable interest rate environment.  Subsequent communication by central banks has helped arrest some of the adverse market dynamics generated immediately after the FOMC meeting and has provided support to risk assets as confidence in the economic outlook has remained relatively stable.  Recently, uncertainty over future Fed leadership and policy continuity may have add ed a new source of market volatility.  Meanwhile, market expectations appear to have coalesced around even odds for a reduction in the pace of asset purchases at the September FOMC meeting.  And while receiving significant attention, Detroit’s bankruptcy f iling has not led to any meaningful additional underperformance of municipal debt, including for state and local governments with significantly underfunded pensions. Exhibit 1 begins with a broad review of changes in financial market conditions.  Longer -term Treasury yields rose significantly, and the primary mortgage rate reached 4.31 percent over the intermeeting period, roughly 75 basis points above levels seen last September.  Fed communications early in the period were viewed by investors as signaling a less accommodative stance of policy and led to a sharp increase in interest rate uncertainty.   Subsequent Fed communications were viewed on balance as reaffirming the commitment to a highly accommodative policy, with portions of the rate increases retracing , but overall interest rate uncertainty remaining elevated compared with  levels reached in the spring.   In addition to recent reassuring policy communications, relatively stable investor confidence in the domestic outlook supported gains in U.S. equitie s and a narrowing of credit spreads.  The top- right panel captures the intermeeting volatility of rates through the lens of forward nominal interest rates.  Up until the Chairman’s NBER comments, forward rates rose by as much as 94 basis points.  The concen tration of the largest moves in the three- to six -year sector is consistent with greater uncertainty regarding the path of short- term interest rates.  In fact, early in the period the risk- neutral market implied path of the fed funds rate breached 50 basis points in the first  quarter of 2015, two quarters earlier than ahead of the June meeting.  One of the more notable features of this episode has been the extent to which communications about the balance sheet impacted market prices sensitive to the path of policy rates.  In the most recent dealer survey and as shown in your middle- left panel, we asked respondents to rate the importance of various factors behind the repricing  of short rates during the period, on a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 assigned to very important factors.  Dealers consistently assigned the highest importance scores to uncertainty around the policy path but also assigned high scores to changing investor views on asset purchases.  This perhaps indicates that many investors and traders do not view the two policy tools as necessarily independent and instead understand communications as either signaling a tighter or looser overall stance of policy.  July 30–31, 20134 of 215The apparent change in many investors’ outlook for monetary policy, or the revelation that some investors don’t understand the current policy mix, is not reflected in the measures of policy expectations we obtain from the dealer survey.  Notably, investors have expressed doubts about how the Committee was interpreting and reacting to incoming data, and whether the Committee was still operating within a framework in which it would be willing to push inflation temporarily above 2 percent in order to promote a more rapid return to maximum employment.  Greater uncertainty about the Committee’s reaction function might also explain the increased market sensitivity to economic data observed over recen t months. The most recent dealer survey suggests that dealer economists view the unemployment condition on liftoff as a threshold.  The middle-right panel shows the average dealer probability distributions of the timing of reaching 6.5 percent unemployment under the assumption the inflation thresholds are not crossed and of the first rate increase.  Dealers place high probability on the unemployment rate threshold being reached before an increase in the target rate.  In considering the importance of various other factors behind the repricing  of the path of short- term rates, dealers assigned a low score to economic data and had mixed opinions on the importance of technical or other factors such as carry trade  unwinds. A staff memo to the Committee detailed how  certain market dynamics served to amplify or accelerate the rise in both short - and long-term yields, possibly leading to some overshooting.  Although market dynamics were not the primary factor behind the repricing  of fixed income from early May, it is an open question as to whether this amplification could occur again.  Further, it is possible that investors’ fear of a reemergence of these dynamics might be a constraint on prudent risk- taking , or alternatively investors might now feel “ immunized” from these effects.  Many market participants thought that the sell- off was exacerbated by a decline in marketmaking by the sell  side.  Although this is a common complaint, it is possible that changes in the regulatory lands cape and financial industry structure along with decreased risk appetite at large dealers might be introducing new market dynamics.  Staffs are currently analyzing the evidence on these issues.  As shown in the bottom-left panel, internal measures of value at risk (VaR ) utilization at dealers declined despite the large jump in rate volatility, suggesting dealers may have lowered their exposure to duration risk before or during the recent rate increase.  Dealers are generally operating well  below current VaR limits, which have tightened across most dealers over the past two to three years.  As seen in the bottom-right panel, high-yield and investment-grade bond funds experienced significant outflows in June, and funds with longer-duration holdings were particu larly susceptible to redemptions.  As a whole, fixed -income funds saw their largest monthly outflows in dollar terms in at least 20 years.  TIPS funds also met with heavy redemptions relative to the size of that market, and the extent of investor selling strained TIPS market liquidity.  These liquidity strains likely lowered market -based measures of inflation compensation early in the period and have made July 30–31, 20135 of 215them somewhat more challenging to interpret.  More recently spot and forward measures of inflation comp ensation have moved up from the lower end of their ranges in recent years.  Your second exhibit focuses on the global market effects of changing investor perceptions of the U.S. monetary policy outlook.  As rates and volatility in U .S. markets rose, investors reduced exposure across a broad range of global assets; higher-risk and less-liquid assets were particularly hard hit.  As seen in the upper- left panel, investments in emerging economy bonds and equities suffered sharp losses immediately following the FOMC meeting.  Though many of these markets would later recover from these losses, it is worth noting that investors appear to be drawing a greater distinction between emerging economies based on underlying fundamentals.  As seen in the upper-right panel, the currencies of countries with weaker fundamentals —proxied here by large r current account deficits —have experienced some of the larger declines against the U .S. dollar in recent months.  This development appears to reflect increasing investor focus on how reduced policy accommodation in the U.S. will impact emerging economies with varying degrees of reliance on foreign capital.  In addition to the U.S. policy outlook, investors have focused on signs that Chinese authorities are increasing efforts to rein  in credit growth and the implications such efforts could have for the Chinese economy.  As shown in the middle- left panel, total financing growth in China has declined, and some interpreted the recent spike in interbank funding rates as signaling the PBOC ’s determination to curtail credit growth.  The timing of the spike probably added to some of the adverse global market dynamics observed in late June.  The remaining three panels turn to developments in other advanced economy financial markets.  As seen i n the middle-right panel, U.K. and German 10- year yields increased early in the period with U.S. yields.  In contrast, JGB yield volatility moderated notably, in part because of  the Bank of Japan’s willingness to adjust operational parameters to address market functioning.  The adjustment of JGB traders to a new equilibrium after a large policy shock has been an important factor in this moderation.  The greater stability in the JGB market has reportedly improved investor sentiment and helped underpin Japanese equities and a weaker yen during the most intense period of global market turbulence, as shown in the bottom- left panel.  The final panel of th e exhibit examines policy developments in the U.K. and euro area, where short -term interest rates , which had b een affected by the global repricing , reacted to communications designed to stabilize policy rate expectations, including additional information on forward rate guidance.  The July ECB statement noted that the Governing Council expected to keep key interes t rates “at present or lower levels for an extended period of time.”  The statement led to some initial flattening of the expected rate path.   This can be seen in the sharp rise in the Eurodollar–E URIBOR  July 30–31, 20136 of 215"
161,20130918,"September 17–18, 20134 of 241policy expectations and some better- than-expected economic data. Financial stresses in some emerging markets intensified early in the period, but conditions have stabilized .  Risks associated with a wider conflict in Syria also contributed to some volatility in asset prices over the period. Your first exhibit begins wi th a brief review of changes in domestic asset prices over the intermeeting period  through last Friday.  As shown in the top- left panel, 2 -and 10- year nominal Treasury yields increased 12 and 27 basis points, respectively, and interest rates on 30- year fixed -rate mortgages rose roughly 26 basis points.  TIPS yields increased more than comparable -maturity nominal Treasury yields, leaving measures of inflation compensation a bit lower.  The S&P 500 and the trade- weighted dollar were both little changed. The rise in interest rates extended the sharp increases seen over the two prior intermeeting periods, and longer- term nominal Treasury yields and mortgage rates are now up roughly 120 basis points since the April/May FOMC meeting; real yields have risen by eve n more.  However, market dynamics such as deleveraging and convexity hedging, which likely amplified the interest rate increases in June and July, appear to have moderated.  Some of these dynamics will be discussed in Mike Kiley’s briefing and were examined in the staff’s recent Quantitative Surveillance report. Despite domestic economic data releases that were, on balance, viewed by market participants as somewhat weaker than expected, the odds placed  on a reduction in the pace of asset purchases at this meeting appeared to increase.  In a continuation of developments since mid-May, investors also seemed to revise up their expectations for the path of the target rate over the next several years, and uncertainty about the outlook for monetary policy i ncreased. Many market participants highlighted shifting expectations regarding Federal Reserve leadership as an increasingly important factor driving interest rates over the period.  Confirming the role that leadership succession played , financial conditions—as measured by bond yields, equity prices, and the dollar—eased significantly early yesterday,  following the announcement that Lawrence Summers , the presumptive favorite, was no longer under consideration to be the c hairman of the Federal Reserve.   Som e of the moves retraced over the day as market attention returned to potential policy actions at this meeting. As shown in the top-right panel, the path of the federal funds rate implied by a straight read of interest rate futures increased over the interm eeting period .  Implied rates 2 to 5 years ahead rose the most, and this part of the curve steepened. The higher rates likely reflect a shift up in investors’ expectations for the most likely path of the target rate, as well as the effects of the increased uncertainty about Federal Reserve policy .  These changes in uncertainty are illustrated in the middle- left panel, which shows the evolution of interest rate implied volatility. To gain further insight into these dynamics, the Desk’s latest primary dealer survey asked respondents to rate the importance of various factors in explaining the roughly 40 basis point increase in the 10- year Treasury yield between the release of the July FOMC statement and September 5 .  The responses, shown in the middle -September 17–18, 20135 of 241right panel, indicate that dealer s believe that changes in market expectations regarding the path of monetary policy and uncertainty about monetary policy, including uncertainty over leadership succession, were the dominant factors contributing to t he yield increase.  A change in the economic outlook and technical factors were rated as less important.  Notably, w e continue to see a divergence between survey respondents’ own policy expectations—which did not shift much over the period—and their assess ment that changes in policy beliefs are the key factors driving interest rates.   This divergence may indicate that the beliefs of dealer respondents differ from those of traders and investors whose views more directly affect prices in markets. Turning to this meeting, as shown to the right side of the bottom- left panel, averaging across the p rimary dealer s’ beliefs produces a 58 percent probability of a reduction in the pace of purchases, a modest increase since the July survey and broadly consistent with the results of many other surveys.  However, beliefs about the odds of this action still range widely.  This contrasts with the move to a concentration of beliefs for some previous changes in balance sheet policy.  For example, as shown to the left side of the panel, views on the likelihood of a second LSAP program had coalesced at very high levels leading into the November 2010 FOMC meeting.  There was, consequently, little market response to the Committee’s announcement of the program.  Given the current dispersion of beliefs, any decision on asset purchases made by the Committee today seems likely to produce some market volatility. One potential concern raised by the continued increase in interest rates over recent months is that some investors may be atta ching probability to the Committee increasing the target rate ahead of reaching the forward guidance thresholds.  To understand views on this, the dealer survey included a special question , which asked respondents to assign probabilities to the unemployment rate falling within various ranges at the time of the first target rate increase, under the assumption that inflation remains well behaved  from above.  As shown in the bottom- right panel, dealer s believe with high likelihood that the unemployment rate will be between 6 and 6½ percent at the time of the first rate increase, and averaging across dealer beliefs produces a probability of 8 percent for the Committee raising the target rate while the unemployment rate is above the 6½ percent threshold.  Dealers who assign relatively high odds to a first rate increase with unemployment still above the threshold are more likely to believe that changed views on asset purchases were an important factor driving yields this period. Your second exhibit focuses on for eign financial developments.  As shown in the top-left panel, longer -term sovereign yields in the U.K. and Germany tracked U .S. yields closely over the period, suggesting that, to a large extent, they were driven by some of the factors impacting U .S. yield s that I described above.  Yields in Japan were stable, likely reflecting , in part, the effects of the BO J’s large purchase program and its extremely accommodative policy stance. As shown in the top- right panel, implied rates on sterling - and euro-denomina ted interest rate futures maturing beyond 2014 have also risen markedly in recent months.September 17–18, 20136 of 241This is an interesting development in light of the introduction of forward rate guidance by the ECB and the Bank of England.  The increase in sterling futures rates was particularly pronounced.  M arket participants at tributed this to the specific conditionality of the guidance, especially the BO E’s “inflation knockouts,” as well as to the fact that the BOE’s 7 percent unemployment rate threshold was at the high end of market expectations for the guidance. Conditions in Europe an financial markets  appear to have been resilient to the rise in yields.  As shown in the middle- left panel, forward sovereign rate spreads in the euro-area periphery have continued to narrow, owing to the insurance provided by the OMT, declining fiscal and current account deficits, reduced near -term sovereign funding needs in Spain and Italy, and lowered dependence of banks on ECB funding.  For similar r easons, European bank shares sharply outperformed both U.S. banks and the overall European stock market.  More broadly, the price- to-earnings ratio of European stocks, shown in the middle-right panel, rose on the period.  Notwithstanding these positive developments, concerns regarding the periphery remain, as public debt levels continue to increase and growth remains tepid .  Market participants will pay keen attention to various upcoming risk events, including elections in Germany and potential political turmoil in Italy, ongoing negotiations between Greece and the IMF, and reviews of the Portuguese and Irish aid program s. Another development has been the moderation of stresses in some emerging markets in recent weeks. Stev e Kamin will discuss these stresses further in his remarks. Staying on the middle -right panel, the price- to-earnings ratio of emerging market equities rose somewhat over the period .  Emerging market currencies, shown in the bottom- left panel, appear to have stabilized .  Both had fallen amid the market volatility in June and then again over the first half of the intermeeting period.  This development is likely due to the continued policy actions by EM central banks , as well as some better -than-expected Chinese economic data. There was considerable variation in asset price performance across emerging markets, as those countries that have large current account deficits funded from portfolio inflows and that face significant policy challenges experienced the weakest equity performance and largest currency depreciations.  The differentiation among currencies is illustrated in the bottom- left panel. While the overall emerging market currency index depreciated only modestly, on net, over the period, the Turkish, Indian, Indonesian, and Brazilian currencies underperformed .  A similar pattern is seen in local -currency  sovereign bond yields in these countries, shown in the bottom-right panel. Your final two exhibits turn to expectations for the evolution of the SOMA portfolio, a review of  market functioning in Treasury and agency MBS markets , and Desk  operations. For perspective on the asset purchase program through the end of August, the SOMA portfolio currently holds $2 trillion in Treasury securities and $1. 4 trillion in agency MBS .

162,20131016,"Transcript of the Federal Open Market Committee Conference Call on  October 16,  2013  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Welcome, everybody.  This is a joint meeting of the Board and the FOMC, so I need a motion to close the meeting. MS. YELLEN.  So moved. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  The purpose of the discussion today is to talk about debt ceiling –related issues and potential responses should the debt ceiling be breached.  As you know, and Linda will explain in more detail, the Congress has made considerable progress today toward, at least for the time being , solving that problem.  So, in that respect, this is very much like the August 1, 2011, meeting, where Granger causality suggests that our meeting was sufficient to solve the problem.  I did consult about whether we needed this meeting today, but first of all the Congress has not finally acted.  Second, they are only putting off this issue until early February, possibly into March , with extraordinary measures.  Third, we haven’t discussed these issues for a couple of years.  And it was also pointed out to me that the minutes of this discussion might be a potentially useful way to communicate some of our thinking to the markets in preparation for another episode, which, unfortunately, seems more likely than not to occur at some point.  So the focus of the meeting today will be some br iefings from staff members , and then we can take as much time as we want to talk about issues and things we need to think about for this problem if it’s not resolved now or if it arises in the future. For the purpose of the minutes, I think it is probably worth my saying that a default on U.S. Treasury securities would be a grave threat both to the economy and to the financial system.  And what we are talking about here today are steps that the Federal Reserve could take to mitigate on the margin the potential effect of such a default, but, obviously, this is not a problem October 16, 20134 of 50that we could eliminate, by any means.  I just wanted to make sure that was part of the discussion. Unless there are any questions or preliminary comments, what I’d like to do is turn now to staff members for briefings and allow time for Q&A after each briefing.  I will begin with Linda Robertson, who is feverishly trying to keep up with the latest congressional developments.  Linda. MS. ROBERTSON.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I’ll start with the current government shutdown and debt ceiling debacle, which are nearly at an end.  There are many ways to account for the tremendous losses from this episode.  Jobs in the private and public sector, consumer confidence, our international standing, a possible and perhaps permanent erosion in the full faith and credit standing, critical government data, and a calling into question of our systems of governance are just a few of the many losses from  this self -inflicted wound.  But the even more remarkable thing about this episode is that the proposed deal does not do anything whatsoever to resolve our longer -term budget or fiscal -related questions.  I’m afraid that when we look back on this episode perhaps the biggest loss is that there were absolutely no lessons learned from this crisis.  So with that introduction, let me quickly cover three questions.  Where are we?  What are the terms of the deal?  And what happens next? In terms  of the deal, it appears, if all goes to plan, that the government will be reopened in the next day or two.  A budget conference of some sort will be asked to convene and to report back by December 13 to set in place the fiscal appropriation and budget parameters for 2014.  It’s probably worth noting that since 2010 we have had eight such budget commissions, all of which have failed to produce much of anything.  In addition to that, the continuing resolution would be extended for fiscal year 2014 appropriat ions until January  15.  This will be done at basically the current sequestration  levels of $986 billion.  Why January 15?  It’s an important date for the formulation of congressional  strategy because that is when the next round of sequestration  for 2014 kicks in, at about a $967 billion level.  Now, that is roughly a $20 billion difference, most of which falls on defense spending.  So one would ask, why all of this for $20 billion?  T he answer to that is th is number greatly diminishes the real divide between the two chambers.  And that was evidenced by the collapse of the appropriation process earlier this summer. The Senate had been moving on a pathway that pretty much ignored sequestration  for the coming year and, consequently, targeted an overall level of government spending about $90 billion above the House level.  The House, while meeting the targets, had its own problems, and they, too, sort of collapsed around themselves earlier this summer because they were trying to make up for what it perceived to be October 16, 20135 of 50inadequate levels of spending in the defense arena by taking from all of the nondefense discretionary spending paths.  For example, the IRS would have had about a 25 percent cut.  Consequently, both the House and Senate paths were troubled.  They got nothing done.  And, consequently, it rolled up into this morass that we have had over the last several weeks.   So they are now going to have another commission —“conference,” if you will—that is going to look at this and report back by December  13 in order to deal with the January 15 deadlines.  So that’ s on the government spending side. The debt ceiling has been wrapped up into this—and we’ve got conflicting information at this point, so I may want to update you as the meeting goes along—but it appears that they are going to have a debt ceiling date of February 7.  And because of the extraordinary measures, the way those work, and the time of year at  which the Secretary of the Treasury will be exercising them, the  extraordinary measures  don’t provide much benefit to the T reasury, extending the debt ceiling date from February  7 to probably mid- March.   If this had been taking place after June 1 or September 1, those extraordinary measures would have given a lot more leeway to the Treasury Departmen t because of the way the tools interact. Now, the unknown, and what we are checking our Black Berrys about , is that apparently they are still negotiating, and perhaps some of the McConnell language on the debt ceiling has made its way into this agreement.  M aybe that’s just for this vote or it could be a more permanent part of the debt ceiling deliberation, and that would be a big deal.   Basically, what the so -called McConnell rule does is provide that the President has the authority to raise the debt ceilin g, and it takes a two- thirds majority of both chambers to reject the President’s action.  I find it hard to believe they are going to do this on a permanent basis because that’s a pretty fundamental change.  But it seems that something akin to that has at least made its way at this hour into the agreement.  MR. TARULLO.  I don’t know that that’s constitutional. MS. ROBERTSON.  Well, that’s an interesting thing.  What started all of this in terms of this process w ere, of course , concerns about the Affordable Care Act, and it looks like the final agreement has a very small provision having to do with income- verification processes.  So what’s next, and where do we find ourselves at this point in time?  I anticipate that once the two chambers  have legislative language, which is still evolving —that  the Senate will go first.  They have an apparent understanding with the senators who have been leading the Affordable Care Act efforts that those senators will not use their parliamentary tools, their pro cess tools, to delay the votes through cloture motions.  It sounds like the Senate will probably vote sometime in the early evening, then allowing the House to act perhaps into the midnight hour tonight. October 16, 20136 of 50"
163,20131030,"a wise thing to do.  In fact, our policy on communications explicitly precludes making comments about “a prediction . . . about Committee action in advance of the Committee ’s announcement of such decision s.”  What I hope you  will do rather than speculate on timing is  to articulate a set of principles, and I would recommend three.  First, data dependence.  We’re going to be tying our decisions, as always, to the incoming data—not one particular piece of data, of course, but the whole general outlook.  The second principle I would suggest would be noting that our criterion of “substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market” has a retrospective and a prospective component.  Retrospectively, we have seen a good bit of improvement—t he term I’ve used is “meaningful” improvement—since September 2012.  It’s worth pointing that out.  I recollect where we feared we might be at this point, and we’re actually in much better shape in the labor market than we thought a year ago.   There’s also a prospective component to our criterion.  We’re hoping to see evidence that the recovery and the improvement in the labor market will continue —and I hope that’s not an excessively high burden, but simply that the outlook for the labor market will continue to improve.  And the third principle I’d recommend to folks is—it’s a phrase I don’t care much for , but— tapering is not tightening , necessarily .  Even as we make the shift from asset purchases to rate policy going forward —and I think this is reflected in our statements —the Committee intends to maintain a highly accommodative policy as needed to achieve recovery and hit our inflation target.   Again, I recognize that there’s a lot of temptation, a lot of speculation.  I think we’re probably better off if we stick to some principles on this issue.  Any comments or questions on that?  [No response] If not, why don’t we go now to our agenda?  Item 1 is “ Financial Developments and  Open Market Operations, ” and let me call on Simon Potter.  October 29–30, 20134 of 239MR. POTTER.1  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Domestic financial conditions eased over the intermeeting period as market participants revised up their expectations for future monetary policy accommodation.  The shift in expectat ions was driven largely by the outcome of the September FOMC meeting, combined with the implications of the federal government shutdown and the weaker- than-expected September employment report.  The debt limit impasse dominated market attention and affecte d a number of money markets and institutions for a time.  The direct effec t in other markets appeared to be relatively limited, though market participants highlighted the potential long-term implications for U.S. financial markets of repeated standoffs ove r the debt limit.  Foreign financial conditions were driven primarily by U.S. developments and also eased over the period. As shown in the top- left panel of your first exhibit, domestic financial markets were driven by several key developments that led mar ket participants to revise their outlook for U.S. monetary policy.  The Committee’s decision not to reduce the pace of its asset purchases at the September meeting evidently surprised many market participants, and other Federal Reserve communications that day—including the 2016 target rate projections —were also perceived as more accommodative than expected.  The shutdown of the federal government delayed the publication of key economic data and increased uncertainty about the economic outlook.  These effect s, along with a resolution to the shutdown and debt limit that could put both fiscal issues back into play in early 2014, reportedly increased expectations for no reduction in the pace of Federal Reserve asset purchases at the next few meetings.  These expectations were reinforced by the weaker -than-expected nonfarm payrolls release last week.  Changes in most domestic asset prices over the period are consistent with expectations for a more accommodative future stance of monetary policy.  As shown in the top-right panel, the 10-year nominal Treasury yield decreased 34 basis points.  Option-adjusted spreads on agency MBS narrowed 17 basis points, and interest rates on 30- year fixed -rate mortgages declined 44 basis points.  High -yield corporate credit spreads n arrowed 14 basis points, the S&P 500 index increased 3 percent, and the DXY dollar index depreciated 2 percent.  Roughly half of these changes came on the day of the September meeting.  TIPS yields declined in line with comparable-maturity nominal Treasury  yields over the period, leaving measures of inflation compensation little changed and within their recent ranges. The results from the Desk’s Survey of P rimary Dealers and other surveys show large shifts over the period in expectations for the timing of the initial reduction in the pace of asset purchases, the path of SOMA holdings, and the path of the target federal funds rate.  As shown in the middle- left panel, averaging across dealers’ probability assessments from the most recent Desk survey, they now see a roughly 90 percent chance that the initial reduction in the pace of purchases will be announced at some point in 2014 or later, with the highest average probability on the March meeting.                                                   1 The materials used by Mr. Potter are appended to this transcript (appendixes 1 and 2).  October 29–30, 20135 of 239Dealers’ probability assessments over meetings in 2014 are qui te flat, indicating either relatively little conviction in their views on the timing of the initial reduction or data dependence.  The median response for the most likely total amount of purchases through 2014 increased nearly $400 billion—the largest such  intermeeting increase since the announcement of outcome-based purchases at the September 2012 meeting.  Once reductions start , dealers continue to expect roughly equal-size reductions in each asset class, as discussed in the memo on the composition of reductions in purchase pace that was sent to the Committee, though a few expect reductions to occur more quickly in Treasuries than in MBS. The revisions to dealer expectations for the path of the federal funds rate over the period were also sizable.  As indicated in the middle -right panel, more than  half of the dealers pushed out their expectation for the most likely timing of the initial target rate increase.  Moreover, the average expectation for the most likely level of the target rate in 2016 and 2017 declined as much as 37 basis points.  This  is the largest  intermeeting -period decline in the expected target rate path since September 2012.  The dealer expected path now lies below the path from the survey ahead of the April–May FOMC meeting, prior to  the rise in interest rates over the spring and summer.  Market pricing also reflects large revisions to expectations for the path of the target rate.  As shown in the bottom-left panel, the path of the federal funds rate implied by a straight read of interest rate futures shifted down, retracing a substantial portion of its rise from early May.  Market -implied rates in 2016 and beyond remain a bit above their pre -JEC levels, in contrast to the dealer survey.  Following the September meeting, many market participants expressed a lack of confidence in their ability to forecast the Committee’s future actions.  For example, many were surprised that the 7 perc ent unemployment rate guidepost for the end of asset purchases that was suggested following the June meeting appeared to have been downplayed.  As shown in the bottom-right panel, on the most recent dealer survey the average rating of the Committee’s commu nication with the markets and the public was the lowest on record.  Nevertheless, most dealer survey measures of uncertainty and disagreement about the path of SOMA holdings and the target federal funds rate were little changed or a bit lower, and measures  of interest rate –implied volatility also declined around the September meeting and over the period.  These declines may reflect the resolution of uncertainty about future Federal Reserve leadership, as well as reduced investor demand for hedging interest rate risk , as a near -term change in the pace of asset purchases is seen as unlikely.  Turning to exhibit 2, developments related to U.S. fiscal policy were followed closely overseas but had limited direct market effect s.  As shown in the top- left panel, financial conditions in the United States  and Europe eased some following the resolution of the debt limit, in contrast to the experience in 2011, when conditions tightened sharply.  The divergence is attributable to the considerable differences between the economic and market backdrops in the two episodes, including S&P’s downgrade of the U.S. sovereign credit rating and a more tenuous financial stability October 29–30, 20136 of 239"
164,20131218,"December 17–18, 20134 of 245working on this, and we have instructed them to complete their analysis and report back to the COP early in the new year. When that is completed, we will fill the Committee in on the results of that. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  Thank you.  All right.  Unle ss there are any other questions or comments, we can go to i tem 1, Financial Developments and Open Market Operations, and I will turn the floor over to Simon Potter. MR. POTTER.1  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Over the intermeeting period, U.S. financial markets were driven by domestic economic data that were, on net, better than market expectations, and by Federal Reserve communications. These factors led market participants to increase the odds they assign to a reduction in the pace of asset purchases being announced at the December or January FOMC meeting and to move out their expectations for the timing of the first increase in the target federal funds rate. Longer -term U.S. interest rates rose, while broader domestic financial conditions improved somewhat.  Financial markets abroad responded to these U.S. developments with little of the drama of the spring and were mainly driven by shifts in domestic economic and policy outlooks. As shown in the top-left panel of your first exhibit, the 10-year nominal Tre asury yield increased 36 basis points over the period, returning to levels seen ahead of the September FOMC meeting. In contrast, the implied rate on the December 2016 Eurodollar futures contract increased less and remains significantly below its September levels. Market participants have interpreted these relative yield movements against the backdrop of better- than-expected data as reflecting an improved understanding by investors that Committee decisions regarding asset purchases do not necessarily signal its intentions for the target rate path.  An assortment of factors have been highlighted as contributing to this improved understanding, especially the policy action and communications from the September meeting and more recent communications from FOMC participants and research papers from senior Board staff. The change in rates across the Eurodollar futures curve since the October meeting is shown in the top- right panel.  M arket participants attribute the decline in s horter-dated rates , despite the surp rising drop in the unemployment rate, to prospects for a clarification or strengthening of the forward guidance to be announced at some point soon.  Many attribute part of the rise in longer- dated rates to an increase in term premiums driven by an inward s hift in expectations for the timing of a reduction in purchases and, correspondingly, somewhat smaller expected cumulative purchase amounts.  Another factor that some have highlighted in explaining the rise in longer-dated rates is that, alongside a shift out in expectations for the timing of the first 1 The materials used by Mr. Potter and Ms. Logan are appended to this transcript (appendix 1).December 17–18, 20135 of 245target rate increase, investors may have come to anticipate a steeper and possibly more uncertain subsequent target rate path.  Of course , other factors, such as a reduction in safe- haven demand as global financial stresses ease, could also be at play. Your next two panels employ the dealer survey to explore more directly this idea of a shift in market participants’ beliefs about the policy mix.  The middle- left panel shows dealers’ probability assessments for the timing of the initial reduction in the pace of purchases. Averaging across their assessments, the chances of an earlier initial reduction have increased since the October survey, and dea lers now place, on average, roughly equal probabilities of 25 to 30 percent on each of the next three meetings. In addition, just over one-third of dealers shifted in their expectation for the most likely timing of the first reduction.  Expectations for the path of SOMA holdings through 2018 were only slightly lower.  While there is substantial disagreement and uncertainty about the timing of the initial reduction in the pace of purchases, dealers expressed only moderate disagreement and uncertainty about the level of the portfolio at the end of 2015, both conditional on different paths for the unemployment rate and unconditionally. Dealers revised their expectations for the target rate, with the median expectation for the most likely timing of liftoff in the fourth quarter of 2015, one quarter later than in the October survey. The expectation for the most likely level of the target rate between 2015 and 2017 declined about 25 basis points, and the median dealer projects a target rate of 1.8 percent at the end of 2016, a bit above the current market-implied path. Consistent with these downward revisions to the expected policy path, dealers now see a greater likelihood that the unemployment rate will be below 6 percent at the time of liftoff, shown in the mid dle-right panel.  This change likely reflects expectations that the Committee will modify its forward guidance. Indeed, all but one of the dealers think that some change to the guidance is more likely than not, and roughly one-half think a reduction in the unemployment rate threshold is more likely than not.  The vast majority of dealers anticipate that any change to the guidance would likely occur at the same time as or before the Committee announces the initial reduction in the pace of purchases. Despite the notable shifts in policy expectations over recent months , measures of inflation compensation, shown in the bottom- left panel, have remained relatively stable .  However, measures of near -term inflation compensation have declined a bit since mid -November, apparently reflecting in part the effects of lower -than-expected realized inflation . Turning to broader asset price developments over the period, as shown in the bottom-right panel, primary mortgage rates increased about 30 basis points, and option- adjusted spreads on current-coupon agency MBS widened, reportedly because of shifts in Fed purchase expectations and concerns about the effects of increased MBS durations and a steeper Treasury yield curve.  Investment- grade and high- yieldDecember 17–18, 20136 of 245corporate credit sp reads narrowed some, while equity prices and t he DXY dollar index were little changed. Nellie will discuss some of the financial stability implications of these price moves and the flows that underlie them. Turning to your next exhibit, longer- dated U.K. sovereign yields rose in line with U.S. yields over the period, while longer- dated German yields  rose more modestly, as shown in the top- left panel. The y ield increases were generally supported by market perceptions of better -than- expected global economic data, with U.S. data surprises passing through meaningfully to both U.K. and German rates markets.  The moves in longer- dated yields were also affected by shifting expectations for monetary policy in the U nited Kingdom and euro area. These changes in monetary policy expectations can be seen through movements in implied rates on interest rate futures contracts , shown in the top- right panel. As I noted earlier, shorter-dated Eurodollar futures rates declined whi le longer -dated rates increased. Futures rates in the United Kingdom were little changed at near -dated maturities but incre ased further out, supported by continued improvement in U.K. economic data and the effects of U.S. data.  Th e improvement in U.K. labor market data prompted the Bank of England to pull forward by one year its projection for when the unemployment threshold in its forward guidance will be reached , which further supported U.K. rates .  In contrast, EURIBOR futures rates declined because of an earlier -than-expected cut in the ECB’s main refinancing rate and relatively soft economic data. The ECB’s decision to lower the main refinancing rate was influenced by a lower -than-expected October flash CPI inflation reading and increased concerns over the inflation outlook.  As shown in the middle- left panel, market -based measures of inflation expectations and the implied path of euro-area policy rates declined following the inflation print.  Ongoing concerns over a passive tightening of liquidity conditions because of continued LTRO repayments —which might put upward pressure on money market rates —also likely contributed to the ECB’s rate cut.  Although expectations for another LTRO, which would add liquidity back to the market, increased over recent months, the ECB recently stated that the funds from any such operation would need to be targeted toward the real economy and not toward  the purchases of higher- yield ing euro -area government bonds. Prospects for additional monetary policy easing continued to be discussed in Japan, contributing to yen depreciation and increases in Japanese equity prices, shown in the middle-right panel.  Most market participants do not expect the Bank of Japan to achieve its 2 percent inflation target  by early 2015 and thus see some likelihood that further accommodative measures will be introduced in early 2014 when the Bank of Japan updates its inflation forecasts.  Although there is no clear consensus on the form of that accommodation, some suggest the BO J could increase its purchases of ETFs or continue Japanese government bond purchases at the current pace for longer. While there may be capacity for the B OJ to increase its purchases of longer-duration JGBs, market participants have expressed some concern over the implications of a significant increase for market functioning."

At its first meeting each year, the Committee reviews the authorizations you just spoke about.  And, with regard to the domestic open market operations, I recommend that the Committee approve the authorization with one small wording change that would make the structure of paragraph 1A similar to the structure of paragraph 1B. In addition to this change, I’d like to update the Committee on two items related to the domestic authorization.  First, as you know, the System Open Market Account (SOMA) contains a significant amount of agency debt and agency MBS, and it is conducting transactions in MBS.  As such, I recommend a continued suspension of the G uidelines for  the Conduct of S ystem Open Market O perations in Federal -Agency I ssues. Second, the current authorization codifies the Open M arket Trading Desk’s ability to transact in agency MBS for the SOMA through agents such as asset managers.  This year , we plan to remove this service from our agreements with the asset managers, which would allow for the removal of paragraph 3 from the domestic authorization next January.  No Committee vote is needed related to these two items. Turning to foreign currency operations :  The Desk conducts such operations under the terms of the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations, the Foreign Currency Directive, and the P rocedural Instructions with Respect to Foreign Currency Operations. I recommend that the Committee approve these documents with three"
166,20140304,"March 4, 20144 of 58and price stability is in most of our SEP forecasts, issues pertaining to liftoff and normalization will naturally come to play a larger role in our policy communications. I would urge everyone to remain mindful, though, of the numerous “ false dawns” the economy has presented.  The effective lower bound on interest rates still imposes an important asymmetry on our ability to respond to upside and downside risks.  For this reason, and also for purposes of policy continuity, I believe it remains important that our forward guidance continues to convey, in terms that are as clear as possible, the conditions under which policy will remain highly accommodative in order to promote recovery and a lasting end to this lengthy zero-interest -rate episode. We did add some language in December that provided specific information about the Committee’s likely behavior after the 6.5 percent threshold is crossed.  And with market expectations now well aligned with both that guidance and our own views, I would personally be quite reluctant to offer less guidance in March than we provided in December and January. There are a number of important issues for us to consider in revising our guidance, and I want to thank the staff for their thoughtful background memo.  I appreciate the very useful comments and suggestions that a number of you provided, and they helped shape the memo and the materials circulated for this videoconference.1 For today’s meeting, we have tried to craft a minim al-changes version of our current statement, and it is labeled as option 5.  But I asked the staff to focus the memo on changes that go well beyond such a minimal- red-ink approach.  Because the crossing of a threshold essentially necessitates a nontrivial revision of the statement, many outside analysts are expecting a change.  So the present moment could provide an attractive opportunity for more 1 The memo “Background Documents and Questions for Discussion on Forward Guidance” used at this meeting by participants is appended to this transcript (appendix 1).March 4, 20145 of 58substantial revisions to the statement. With many commentators expecting the forward guidance to change, we will of course have the usual difficulties divining just what observers will make of any changes we decide to adopt or, indeed, what they would make of the absence of much change.  Despite these difficulties, I would encourage us to consider whether we could substantially clarify our intentions, remembering, as always, that some minimalist approach, perhaps along the lines of the one circulated by the staff last Friday, will end up being deemed best. Let me highlight four specific issues raised in our prior discussions and in the memo.  First, the current guidance is focused on the unemployment rate, but we have consistently communicated that once the threshold is crossed we will be considering a more comprehensive evaluation of the labor market.  Now may be an appropriat e time to signal this shift in the statement.   Some of the options suggested in the staff memo focused on the state of employment relative to our assessment of its maximum sustainable level. This formulation has the virtue of being taken from our S tatemen t of Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy , but this approach would bring a new concept into the statement and might itself seem to call for some new, single measure of slack.   Alternatively, the language circulated last Friday simply makes reference to an assessment of whether the recovery in the labor market is complete.  This formulation might accurately bring to mind the broad assessment that we actually engage in. Second, over the past several months, the possibility of inflation running persis tently and significantly below our objective has become more prominent.  It might be appropriate to clarify the role of low inflation in our policy intentions beyond the clause we added in December that specifies that the current target range is likely to be maintained, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee’s 2  percent longer- run goal.  The first two options in theMarch 4, 20146 of 58staff memo refer explicitly to the shortfall of inflation from our 2 percent objective as a condition determining how long to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate, and option 3 provides one version of an inflation floor. Third, some of you have indicated in past discussions a preference to clarify the role of financial developments in the statement.  This could be warranted, for example, either to address concerns over financial stability, which may grow as the period of highly accommodative policy continues and the economy strengthens, or, alternatively, to convey a willingness of the FOMC to respond if, say, financial conditions tighten in a way that compromises the outlook for attaining our objectives.  The options provided by the staff give an approach that encompasses both of these considerations.  And option 4 provides an alternative that focuses directly on financial -stability risks. Finally, if the recovery continues as we all hope, we will face an increasing need to clarify how policy will be conducted during the transitional period between liftoff and the time when we settle into some new normal.  The current statement mainly suggests that the FOMC will, after liftoff, embrace the balanced approach from the consensus statement.  But this is language that sheds little light on policy in the broad range of likely cases in which both empl oyment and inflation are falling short of our objectives, so that any need to balance conflicting objectives remains well in the future. In the new paragraph 6 that is included in the first four options, the staff has provided two sentences pertaining to the post- liftoff period.  The first might be viewed as a very general description of the reaction function, whereas the second is focused on the fact that even after we return to price stability and full employment, the appropriate federal funds rate target may remain low relative to what we view as normal in the longer run."
167,20140319,"March 18–19, 20144 of 173Actual and expected monetary policy tightening by some central banks appeared to support the reduction in emer ging market stresses.  Tightening actions in Turkey, Brazil, and South Africa were seen as positive steps toward addressing imbalances.  These actions resulted in higher short -term interest rates, as shown in the middle -right panel.  Furthermore, measures to reduce fiscal accommodation in some emerging markets helped to increase policy credibility by reinforcing perceptions of the authorities’ commitment to a timely correction of imbalances.  Despite these positive steps, market participants remain focused on structural vulnerabilities and risks across emerging market economies. Elsewhere in emerging markets, focus has been on developments in Ukraine and their potential impact  on global financial markets.  While escalating tensions in the region have led to some limited financial market volatility, the impact has been more pronounced on Russian asset prices.  To contain pressures on the ruble, the Russian central bank increased its policy rate by 150 basis points in early March—leading to the increase in Russia’s one- year swap rate seen in the middle-right panel—and has been intervening directly in the foreign exchange market. In China, official-sector actions and concerns over a potential moderation in the growth outlook received considerable attention over the period.  The bottom- left panel shows the relatively sharp depreciation of onshore renminbi, which followed a depreciation of the official exchange rate fix and reported intervention by the PBOC. Although the actions to depreciate the renminbi may be consistent with concerns over recent moderation in the Chinese growth outlook, market participants generally interpret them as reflecting a new effort to stem rising capital inflows, which have contributed to credit growth beyond levels Chinese policymakers appear comfortable with.  In particular, the depreciation likely reflects a desire by the PBOC to introduce greater two -way exchange rate risk after a reported buildup of speculative positions in the offshore market and may have been a precursor for the doubling to 2 percent of the onshore renminbi intraday trading band that was announced this past weekend.  Market participants believe that the interventions were at least partially unsterilized and led to the decline in onshore interbank lending rates shown in the bottom- left panel. Chinese credit markets were also in focus as authorities allowed the first domestic bond default since 1997.  Participants interpreted the lack of a support package from authorities as signaling a greater willingness to allow for a more market -determined financial system and to reduce implicit guarantees associated with investment products and corporate bonds. While the reaction in Chinese corporate credit markets was limited, copper and iron ore prices declined sharply, as shown i n the bottom-right panel.  The declines were due in part to concerns of higher future credit costs that could constrain Chinese growth and were amplified by weaker -than-expected Chinese production and trade data.  Steve will discuss revisions to the staff’ s forecast for Chinese GDP growth in his briefing.  In addition, base metals are widely used in China as a financing vehicle for onshore carry trades that invest in corporate credit or other high -yielding assets.  Market participants believe that this type of trade is only one of many carry trade strategies present in theMarch 18–19, 20145 of 173Chinese onshore and offshore financial system produced by investors’ attempts to evade regulation and exploit large yield differentials. The top-left panel of your next exhibit reviews the market reaction to the Bank of England’s changes to its forward guidance in mid-February.  The BO E shifted emphasis from its 7 percent unemployment threshold to a focus on a broader set of economic indicators. While market participants had generally expe cted such a shift, following the announcement short-term interest rates rose sharply and broader financial conditions tightened modestly.  Market participants attributed this reaction to the MPC’s higher -than-expected GDP projections, which accompanied the change to the guidance, as well as to Governor Carney’s emphasis on these projections in the related press conference.  The B OE experience may illustrate the heightened sensitivity of market prices to central bank communications about the outlook as quantitative forward guidance is removed. With regard to expectations of FOMC  policy, as shown in the top-right panel, respondents to the Desk’s dealer and buy-side surveys assign high odds to the Committee changing its forward rate guidance, with the vast majority expecting a change to be announced at this meeting.  Dealers and buy- side participants assign the highest probability to the Committee providing additional qualitative guidance relevant to determining the appropriate timing of the first rate hike.  Th ey also assign a significant probability to the Committee providing additional information on the path of the target rate after the first hike. The median expectation for the timing of liftoff in both surveys remains the second half of 2015—broadly in line with market- based measures—al though the median dealer expectation shifted toward a slightly earlier liftoff relative to the January survey.  With regard to economic conditions anticipated at liftoff, a new survey question asked about expectations for inflation in the one to two years following the first hike.  As shown in the middle-left panel, averaging across respondents, both dealers and buy- side participants assign a probability of around 40 percent to inflation over this horizon registering within 1 quarter point of the Committee’s 2 percent objective.  The average probability distribution for each group of respondents appears to be roughly symmetric around 2 percent.  Bill will talk more about respondents’ expectations for economic conditions at the time of liftoff in his briefing. With regard to asset purchases, all survey respondents view a reduction in the pace of asset purchases at this meeting as almost certain.  Nearly all expect that the FOMC will continue to reduce the monthly pace of purchases by $10 billion at each meeting, split evenly between Treasuries and MBS.  Additionally, respondents believe that persistently large surprises in top -tier economic data would be required for the Committee to deviate from this “measured steps” path. With regard to the target rate path, the middle -right panel shows that the market -implied path shifted down a bit over the intermeeting period and remains broadly in line with the median of year- end projections from the December SEP.  The panel also shows the m edian expected rates from the Desk’s dealer and buy -side surveys; these lie below the market -implied path through 2015 but above it thereafter.  As shown in the bottom -March 18–19, 20146 of 173left panel, most respondents anticipate that the changes to the guidance that they view as most likely would have little impact on market expectations for the timing of liftoff or the subsequent target rate path.  Among those who do expect a change to the guidance to affect market rate expectations, views are heterogeneous:  Nearly all dealers  anticipating a change think that the expected target rate path would flatten, while nearly all buy- side participants anticipating a change think that it would steepen. The bottom-right panel shows the mean dealer expectation for the longer-run target fed funds rate.  In the most recent survey, the decline in the mean was the largest since the question was introduced in mid-2012, and the median response also changed for the first time, declining from 4.0 percent to 3.75 percent.  The decline may be related to revisions to expectations for longer-run GDP growth, also shown in the bottom- right panel.  Separate from the survey, market commentary last week highlighted some expectations that Committee participants would revise lower their longer -run target rate forecasts in the SEP. Turning to Desk operations, if the Committee continues reducing the pace of purchases, the Desk plans some operational changes.  In particular, we plan to adjust the number of Treasury operations if the pace declines below $30 billion while maintaining the current maturity distribution of purchases, shown in the top-left panel of your third exhibit.  This approach will maintain the average duration of Treasury purchases at about nine years.  The Committee could, of course, consider alt ernative approaches as it reduces the pace of purchases, including those that would change the maturity distribution and, thus, the duration targe t of the Treasury purchases. For MBS, the Desk intends to decrease the size of daily operations to meet the Committee’s monthly purchase pace, though actual daily operation sizes will vary based on fluctuations in monthly reinvestments.  We will continue to focus purchases in production coupons.  Additionally, as noted in the memo we circulated ahead of the meetin g, we are beginning the process of transitioning MBS purchases to our proprietary FedTrade platform, which will improve the efficiency and transparency of our operations.  We anticipate that these operations with FedTrade will begin on April 9. Expectations for the path of remaining purchases from the dealer survey imply that the par value of the SOMA portfolio would peak near the end of this year at $4.2 trillion. At that point, SOMA holdings would consist of $2.5 trillion in Treasuries and $1.7 trillion in MBS, as shown in the top-right panel.  MBS holdings would represent 41 percent of the outstanding stock of available securities, while Treasury holdings would represent 23 percent of coupon securities outstanding. Increases in the size and duration of SOMA holdings have resulted in a substantial rise in the interest rate risk of the portfolio, as was the policy intent in removing duration from the market.  The middle-left panel shows the net unrealized gain or loss position of the portfolio, defined as the difference between its market and book values.  The net unrealized gain was $38 billion at the end of February—a decline of nearly $175 billion since the start of 2013, but an increase of about $90 billion from the level that was footnoted in the year- end financial statements released last Friday."
168,20140430,"April 29–30, 20144 of 267Transcript of the Federal Open Market Committee Meeting on April 29 –30, 2014 April 29 Session CHAIR YELLEN.  Good morning, everybody.  Unfortunately, this is the last FOMC meeting for both President Pianalto and Governor Stein.  I think you know that tonight we will have a joint farewell reception and dinner for our colleagues, as well as for former governor Sarah Bloom Raskin .  But I would like to take this opportunity to thank them here as well. Sandy began attending FOMC meetings in 1993 as a f irst v ice president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and then started attending as president of the Bank in the relative calm of 2003.  [Laughter]  All in all, she has attended 101 FOMC meetings, which is more than any other currently serving president.  Sandy has always been a voice of reason, and her contributions have been much appreciated, particularly during some of the darkest days of the financial crisis. Jeremy is one of our newest colleagues.  He joined the Committee in June 2012 and has attended 16 meetings.  During his time here, Jeremy has had to grapple with how to set policy in an econom y that is still recovering from the crisis, and he has made very important intellectual contributions to the work of the Board and of the FOMC. Both Sandy and Jeremy have been wonderful colleagues.  Sandy and Jeremy, thank you both for your service.  I want you to know you will be greatly missed, and we will have more words to say this evening.  [Applause] Bill, do you want to introduce your colleague? VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. Yes.  I want to introduce Antoine Martin, who is at the table, from the r esearch department in New York.  W elcome, Antoine.April 29–30, 20145 of 267CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay.  And now let’s turn to our first topic, which is monetary policy normalization.  Let me say that this discussion will take place as a joint meeting of the FOMC and the Board.  And with respect to our Board meeting, I will need a motion to close the meeting. MR. TARULLO.  So moved. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Without objection. I would like to start off our session this morning with a few remarks on the objectives and timetable for our work on monetary policy normalization.  Before doing so, though, I want to give special thanks to the staff for all their hard work on these complicated issues and for the excellent set of memos that they prepared for this meeting. Let me begin by saying I am completely convinced that we have the tools to adjust the stance of policy as needed to meet our macroeconomic objectives.  So this discussion is about how to deploy our mix of tools to attain these objectives most effectively in a way that balances other considerations appropriately.  As the briefing materials make clear, however, there is quite a mix of subtle and intertwined issues to take into account, involving market functioning, the scope of our activities in the nonbank sector, communications, financial stability, and possible implications of our current choices for our longer-run operating procedure. I don’t want to get into the substance of these issues at this point. I just want to make a few overarching comments that may serve to frame our discussion. If the recovery proceeds broadly as we expect, we will likely begin to raise interest rates sometime next year. I believe it is important that w e communicate our normalization plans to the public well before that time. I would see the press conference after the September meeting as potentially providing a good opportunity to lay out for the public some of our thinking on theseApril 29–30, 20146 of 267matters.  If you agree with this timetable, we will need to make substantial progress in nailing down our approach over the course of this meeting and, then, the June and July meetings.  There are difficult issues here, which we need to work through collectively, before we can be confident that we are ready to manage the normalization process and convey that confidence to the public.  So I think a concentrated effort will surely be required to make the necessary progress by September. Of course—and fortunately—we are not star ting from scratch.  Our deliberations will build on our earlier discussions of normalization and draw on the results from the ongoing testing of our tools.  One lesson from our earlier efforts at spelling out our exit strategy, which is a topic we discussed at length in our meeting just a year ago, is that what may seem perfectly sensible ex ante  may end up seeming much less attractive as conditions change in unforeseen ways.  I think we need to accept the reality that we cannot know exactly what kind of ma rket conditions and considerations we will face when the time comes to begin raising rates.  And we cannot know with precision how well any particular strategy will work.  So, while I don’t want to prejudge any decisions on specific issues, I believe it is important that we create a framework in which we can deploy our mix of tools relatively flexibly to deal with contingencies that may arise. But it is equally important that we agree on a framework that we can explain simply and clearly, so as to convincingly convey our confidence that we can adjust the stance of policy as appropriate to promote our macroeconomic objectives.  I think we should also provide clarity , to the extent possible, about the mechanics of our approach in order to ease the transition for market participants, particularly in those markets in which we may be acting in new ways.  And I think our success will depend in part on our communication strategy."
169,20140618,"June 17–18, 20144 of 302Transcript of the Federal Open Market Committee Meeting on June 17–18, 2014 June 1 7 Session CHAIR YELLEN.  I’d like to begin by welcoming three people to the table today:  Stan Fischer, Lael Brainard, and Loretta Mester.   This is the first FOMC meeting for both Stan and Lael, but both have very deep experience in economic policy over many years in a variety of other contexts.  Loretta, as you all know, has actually been attending FOMC meetings for 14 years, but she joins us now as President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland. We welcome our three distinguished colleagues and look forward to collaborating with them and to learning from them. The first thing we need to do is items 1 and 2 this morning, which we will discuss in a joint FOMC and Board meeting.  So with respect to the Board meeting, I need a motion to close the meeting.   [Aside to Governor Fischer]  “ So move d.”.  Remember, I told you, i t is an assigned job . MR. FISCHER.  So it’s always “so moved”?  T here’s no variation? CHAIR YELLEN. No, that’s it. MR. FISCHER.  No variation.  All right. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  And then I say, “Without objection.”  [Laughter] Maybe there is an objection , but a t any rate, our first item is a staff report on market developments and operations.  Lorie Logan. MS. LOGAN.1  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Over the intermeeting period, market participants were focused on two ongoing themes:  the decline in longer- term interest rates, and the low levels of volatility across financial markets.  I will focus on these two developments before turning to the ECB’s recent policy actions.  Simon will review Desk operations and discuss two memos on the effective federal funds rate 1 The materials used by Ms. Logan and Mr. Potter are appended to this transcript (appendix 1).June 17–18, 20145 of 302and overnight RRP counterparty framework that you received in advance of the meeting  today. As shown in the top-left panel of your first exhibit, domestic financial conditions eased a bit over the period, continuing a broad tr end since the December FOMC meeting.  Longer- term U.S. interest rates have declined —driven almost entirely by declines in real rates—while corporate credit spreads have narrowed and equity prices have increased.  This easing in conditions has occurred against a backdrop of highly accommodative monetary policy from major developed- economy central banks, including the ECB. The pronounced decline in longer- term tenors has occurred across advanced foreign economies despite important differences in their economi c and policy outlooks.  As shown in the top-right panel, the U.S., U.K., and German five-year, five-year forward nominal rates are about 65 to 90 basis points lower since December. Market participants cite a variety of potential drivers for the declines, but do express some puzzlement  over the extent of the moves. To better understand the drivers, the Desk’s dealer and buy- side surveys asked respondents to rate the importance of various factors in explaining the decline in the five-year, five -year forward Treasury rate since the end of last year.  As shown in the middle- left panel, on average, respondents assigned the highest importance to three factors: a decline in the expected level of the long -run real federal funds rate, changes in economic and policy outlooks in other advanced economies, and “market -related factors ,” which includes things such as portfolio reallocation, positioning, and safe-haven flows.  Changes to the U.S. economic outlook and the accumulation of U.S. dollar reserves were viewed as somewhat less important, although as you can see, buy-side participants placed more weight than dealers on reserve accumulation as a factor. The Desk’s surveys provide further evidence of the importance of a decline in the expected level of the long -run federal funds rate as a contributor to the decline in longer-dated forwards.  As shown in the middle-right panel, the distribution of dealer estimates of the longer -run target rate shifted down between the December and June surveys, with the median and modal responses declining from 4 percent to 3.5 percent.  The buy-side survey also shows a decline in expectations for the longer- run rate. In commentary explaining revisions to these expectations, dealers principally highlighted reductions in estimates of pot ential GDP growth.  Additionally, many have highlighted comments reportedly made by former Chairman Bernanke during recent private speaking engagements that he does not expect the federal funds rate to reach 4 percent in his lifetime.  Notably, roughly one- third of dealers expect some downward revisions to the SEP projections for the longer- run target rate. As I noted, survey respondents also rated changes in the economic and policy outlooks in other advanced economies as an important contributor.  C omme ntary over the period highlighted building expectations for additional accommodation from theJune 17–18, 20146 of 302ECB, which reportedly pressured euro-area sovereign yields lower, increasing the relative attractiveness of Treasury securities. Lastly, survey respondents rated market -related factors highly.  Desk contacts have pointed to a reversal of positions from investors who came into 2014 betting on an increase in rates as one such factor.  This view is supported by net speculative positioning in 10- year Treasury futures, which has moved closer to neutral after starting the year significantly short. In contrast to longer- term rates, the market -implied federal funds rate path is little changed since December, as shown in the bottom- left panel, and currently lies below the me dian of Committee participants’ target rate projections in the March SEP. Most dealer and buy-side survey respondents continue to see the second half of 2015 as having the highest probability of liftoff, roughly in line with market pricing, and do not expect material changes to the 2015 or 2016 rate projections in the forthcoming SEP.  Among those who do expect changes to these nearer- term rate projections, views are roughly evenly split on the likely direction of those changes. In sum, while expectations for the path of policy rates over the next several years appear little changed since December, the evidence suggests that a significant portion of the decline in longer- dated forward rates is due to declines in longer -run policy rate expectations.  A numbe r of other factors also appear to have depressed term premiums. One other factor that Desk contacts have linked to the declines in longer- term interest rates is the low level of realized and implied interest rate volatility, the second theme in focus over the period.  In fact, low volatility is a phenomenon that extends broadly across financial markets.  As shown in the bottom- right panel, implied volatilities in equity, currency, and interest rate markets are currently at or near their lows since these mar kets developed in the 1990s and around levels prevailing just prior to the financial crisis.  While the panel shows options with one-month expiries, implied volatility on options with longer expiries has also generally declined, albeit not to historic al lows. The Desk’s surveys asked respondents to rate the importance of various factors in explaining declines in implied volatility across markets.  As shown in the top- left panel of your next exhibit, respondents on average rated “investor reach -for-yield behavior” and “ low levels of realized volatility ” as the most important factors.  Reduced uncertainty about central bank reaction functions and the global economic outlook were viewed as relatively less important.  Reach- for-yield behavior in this context might be interpreted as investor willingness to sell options even when the expected returns to doing so are unduly low, in an effort to boost portfolio returns amid exceptionally low levels of interest rates.  Desk contacts report that selling options to enhance yield is being employed in larger size by a wider array of market participants."
170,20140730,"Transcript of the Federal Open Market Committee Meeting on  July 29–30, 2014  July 29 Session   CHAIR YELLEN.  Good morning, everybody.  I would like to begin today’s meeting by giving the floor to President Fisher, who asked if he could take a minute to address the group. MR. FISHER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I wanted to apologize to the group for having an excerpted part of my speech in the Wall Street Journal  on Monday during the blackout period.  I asked them not to publish it during the blackout.  Michelle has seen the string of e- mails.  They sent me back what I actually said, which is always dangerous, on the 16th of July.  I did correct it because there were a lot of misstatements in there that they had created from the speech.  Having said that, I think all of us, especially me, need to be conscious of the fact that whatever we say can appear.  I did argue with them about publishing it.  They were firm on it. But I think, Madam Chair, I am embarrassed because this is a sacred institution.  I am also embarrassed because they had one of the San Francisco Fed’s dollars in the picture.  It had  an “L” at the very end , rather than a “ K.”  I don’t want to embarrass my colleague from San Francisco, and I just wanted to issue a public “ I’m sorry. ”  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Next I want to mention that the subcommittee on communications is up and running under the leadership of Governor Fischer.  I thought I would just turn over the floor to him for a second to report on their activities.  MR. FISCHER.  Tha nks very much, Madam Chair.  W e are waiting for the third “ Fisher ” to come follow me and say something.  [Laughter]  The communications s ubcommittee consists now of Jay Powell, Loretta Mester, John Williams, and me.  We had our first, primarily agenda-setting , meeting this morning, and the first item on the agenda is going to be revising the July 29–30, 20144 of 306statement on longer -term goals and monetary policy strategy  that was agreed on in January by the Federal Open Market Committee.  We’ve had the idea of circulating some of the discussion that took place in this Committee when that was discussed, so that people can see what the issues are.  We are clearly going to have to find some way of relating to the financial-stability function, which is not defin ed as part of our dual mandate.  We h ave a hard time getting financial stability into the dual mandate, but we clearly are focusing more on it than we did in the past, and it will have to make an appearance of some sort.   There are other issues that you di scussed earlier , ones that possibly we could make another incremental step on, but we will see what those are, and we hope to have something ready to discuss at the December meeting.   Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Great.  Thank you.  O ur first two items this m orning will be considered in a joint meeting of the FOMC and the Board.  I need a motion to close the Board meeting. MR. FISCHER.  So moved. CHAIR YELLEN.  Without objection.  Thank you.  Let me turn over the floor now to Simon for the Desk report. MR. POTTER.1  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Over the intermeeting period, domestic financial conditions eased as longer -term interest rates declined and equity prices increased.  As shown in the top-left panel of your first exhibit, markets responded to some better- than-expected labor market data and Federal Reserve communications that focused less on the recent uptick in inflation than some had anticipated.  Market participants paid particular attention to the discussion of policy normalization in the June FOMC meetin g minutes, which reportedly put downward pressure on short -term interest rates.  Broad U.S. financial markets were little affected, on net, by unfavorable geopolitical developments, though they led to declines in Treasury yields at times.  In terms of broader themes, market participants continued to focus on the substantial decline in longer -dated forward rates across advanced economies and the                                                  1 The materials used by Mr. Potter are appended to this transcript (appendix 1).  July 29–30, 20145 of 306low levels of volatility in financial markets since the beginning of the year.  There is also growing attention on the relative stability of the expected fed eral funds path.  The top- right panel shows this path is little changed since December, despite better -than-expected labor market data and shifts higher in the SEP rate projections.  At present, the market -implied path lies notably below the median of the June SEP paths. The Desk’s surveys can be used to examine more directly whether aspects of market beliefs on the path of policy have changed more materially despite the relative stability of the market-implied path.  Since dealers’ and buy- side participants’ responses were not notably different from  each other in the most recent surveys, I will focus on the dealer results, for which we have a longer history.  As shown in the middle- left panel, since December the average probability dealers assign to liftoff occurring in 2015 has increased about 25 percentage points.  Further, the dealers are placing increasingly more weight on liftoff in the first half of 2015.  However, views of the pace of tightening thereafter do not seem to have changed much.  The middle-right panel shows dealer average responses for the modal pa ce of tightening after liftoff since the start of 2013.  On average, dealers expect the FOMC to tighten about 125 basis points per year for the first two years after liftoff, and there has been little change in this view.  The modal pace in the third year is lower, and has declined recently, consistent with the lower expectations for the longer- run neutral rate.  One explanation for the recent stability in the modal pace of tightening in the first two years of rate normalization is that market participants’ broad economic outlook is not markedly changed.  Indeed, while unemployment rate forecasts from the Desk’s and other surveys have markedly declined since December, GDP growth and inflation forecasts for 2015 and 2016 are little changed.  With regard to the growing difference between the market -implied path and the SEP  path, contacts have suggested this partly reflects the interpretation of the so -called d ots.  Market participants generally believe that  the futures market is priced near the perceived level of the Chair’s projections, which most believe is the 4th to 7th lowest dot. However, there are many  market  participants who suggest the market as a whole might be overly complacent in forming their expectations for monetary policy amid continued accommodation supported by forward guidance and low market volatility.  Direct evidence on this issue from market reaction to economic data releases is mixed:  The Tealbook, examining a sample going back to 1990, finds little convincing evidence of excessively low sensitivity to economic news.  However, Desk analysis using a smaller sample finds, as does the Tealbook, that the responsiveness of longer -term interest rates to economic data surprises has been lower this year than it was in the prior three years.  Market prices that could register possible unease about the policy rate path show almost the opposite of concern.  Measures of fixed -income skew , while still p ositive, have declined since the start of the year, as shown in the bottom-left panel, suggesting investors in these markets now see less risk of a shift up in rates.  Additionally, as shown in the bottom- right panel, longer -term measures of inflation comp ensation are very stable, although shorter- dated measures have increased in recent months along July 29–30, 20146 of 306"
171,20140917,"Transcript of the Federal Open Market Committee Meeting on  Septembe r 16–17, 2014  September 16 Session   CHAIR YEL LEN.  Good morning, everybody. Our first two items this morning will be conducted in a joint meeting between the FOMC and the Board.  I need a motion to close the Board meeting. MR. FISCHER.  So moved. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Without objection.  Our first topic is financial developments and open market operations.  I’m going to turn it over to Simon. MR. POTTER.1  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Domestic economic data over the intermeeting period were mixed but viewed as consistent with a gradually improving economy.  Meanwhile, Federal Reserve communications were, on balance, interpreted as signaling a slightly less accommodative policy stance.  The ECB surprised markets at its September meeting by cut ting its policy rates by 10 basis points while also announcing additional asset purchase programs.  Growing expectations for a divergence of the stance of monetary policy in the United States from that of  other countries led to a broad appreciation of the dollar.  Across financial markets, the main themes that have been in focus over recent months endured, most notably low volatility and declines in long- dated forward rates.   Another ongoing theme this year has been the relative stability of short-dated interest rates in the United States.  As shown in the top -left panel, the market- implied federal funds rate path through 2017 has increased only slightly since just prior to the December 2013 FOMC meeting, at which the initial reduction in the pace of asset purchases was announced.  As I’ve highlighted in prior briefings, this relative stability is partly attributable to limited changes in market views of the broad economic outlook despite a faster- than-expected decline in the unemployment rate.  The market -implied path did shift up modestly last week as commentary focused on the prospects for a change to the Committee’s forward guidance.  Five out of 22 respondents to the Desk’s dealer survey expect a change at this meeting, while others cited a change in forw ard guidance as a risk to their Fed outlook.  Since the survey was received, 5 additional dealers now expect a change in forward guidance at this meeting.                                                  1 The materials used by Mr. Potter and Ms. Logan are appended to this transcript (appendix 1).  September 16–17, 20144 of 232The recent slight shift up in the market-implied path has been accompanied by a coalescing of views f or liftoff to occur during the middle of 2015, as reflected in recent Desk and private-sector surveys.  Averaging across respondents, the Desk’s dealer and buy-side surveys now show respondents attach a probability of a bit more than 50 percent to liftoff occurring in the second or third quarter of next year. The market -implied pace of tightening after liftoff appears slower than measures constructed from either the median SEP dots or expectations of the target rate from the Desk’s surveys, and this diverge nce has been the focus of some market commentary.  However, one important reason for the divergence is that the market path and SEP participant and Desk survey paths reflect different concepts.  In particular, the market path reflects the risk -neutral expe ctation across a variety of different potential outcomes for rates and the economy, whereas the SEP and Desk surveys most likely reflect modal paths built on the modal economic outlook. To better understand expectations for the path of tightening following liftoff, the Desk asked survey respondents to provide probability distributions for the pace of tightening in the first and second years after liftoff, conditional on not  returning to the zero lower bound.  These distributions, pooled across both surveys, are shown in the top-right panel .  Averaging the results across respondents, the density -implied mean pace of tightening during the first and second years of normalization are approximately 110 basis points and 125 basis points, respectively.  As can be seen in the chart, in the first year there is something of a negative skew to the probability assessment relative to the second year.  Further, the 200 basis point per year pace of tightening seen in the last cycle from 2004 to 2006 is not given much probability weight. On average, respondents also assigned a 20 percent probability to returning to the zero lower bound within the first two years after liftoff.  If market participants generally share this view, the expected pace of tightening indicated by the surveys is broadly in line with measures taken from market prices.  These results tentatively suggest that current market pricing may not, in fact, be difficult to square with the median SEP dots or surveys.  We will need more experience with the results o f this question to move this assessment up from the tentative level.  Looking further out on the yield curve, the nominal five- year, five -year-forward rate in the United States and other advanced foreign economies declined for most of the period, as shown in the middle- left panel, but retraced toward the end.  The declines in longer -dated U.S. forward rates were attributed by market participants to a continuation of factors discussed in prior Desk briefings, including flight- to-quality flows driven by geopol itical tensions, spillover from declines in euro -area yields, and lowered expectations for longer-run economic growth.  Respondents to the Desk’s surveys attribute most of the decline in the five-year, five- year-forward Treasury rate over recent months to the usual culprit of term premiums, but also to a 25 basis point decrease in the expected average real policy rate, to about 1 percent.  Declines in the expected average inflation rate were seen as comprising only a very small portion of the move. September 16–17, 20145 of 232That sai d, spot and forward market- based measures of inflation compensation fell over the intermeeting period, as shown in the middle-right panel.  Declines in spot five-year inflation compensation were largely due to a slight moderation in recent CPI readings and  lower energy prices.  Over the period, crude oil and gasoline futures declined 8 and 12 percent, respectively, mostly because of higher-than-expected output from OPEC nations and U.S. refineries. Shifting to international developments, euro-area and U.K. short rates declined notably over the period, as shown in the bottom- left panel.  The declines in euro -area rates were due to expected and actual ECB policy easing, while the declines in U.K. rates were due to shifting Bank of England commentary, some mixed economic data, and concerns over the referendum in Scotland.  Specifically, in the United Kingdom, the quarterly Inflation Report  suggested that there may be more labor market slack and thus more subdued wage pressure than previously assessed by the BOE.  Even so, market expectations are for the BOE to begin normalizing policy early to mid next year, similar to expectations for the start of normalization in the United States.  This contrasts with the ECB and the Bank of Japan, which are either expected to leave policy unchanged or further ease over the near- to-medium term.  The effects of this divergence in monetary policy outlooks have been apparent in currency markets.  As shown in the bottom-right panel, the U.S. dollar appreciated broadly against major and emerging market currencies over the period.  Taking into account moves since early May, when ECB President Draghi indicated that the Governing Council was open to taking further policy action, the U.S. dollar has appreciated most against the euro and yen.  At the end of the period, sterling depreciated against the dollar, driven by perceptions that the likelihood of a “yes” vote on Scottish independence had increased. Another theme in markets in the past few months has been the low level of both implied  and realized volatility despite a seemingly high level of geopolitical uncertainty and amid the prospect of diverging policy stances in major economies.  Uncertainty related to the pending Scottish vote, as well as the ECB’s policy actions, has contribute d to a sharp increase in implied volatility across major currency pairs in recent weeks, as shown in the top -left panel of your next exhibit.  Outside currency markets, extremely low levels of interest rate and equity -implied volatility have persisted.  Focusing more closely on the performance of the euro since the May ECB meeting, expectations for additional ECB easing have been building steadily over this period.  As shown in the top-right panel, the euro has gradually depreciated against the U.S. dollar, with the most recent sharp declines occurring in the wake of President Draghi’s remarks at the Jackson Hole symposium and the September ECB meeting.  At the September meeting, the ECB surprised the market by reducing its benchmark policy and deposit rates by 10 basis points each, to 5 basis points and negative 20 basis points, respectively.  In addition, the ECB pledged to begin purchasing private nonfinancial asset -backed securities and covered bonds starting in October. September 16–17, 20146 of 232"
172,20141029,"Transcript of the Federal Open Market Committee Meeting on  October 28 –29, 2014  October 28 Session   CHAIR YELLEN.  I’d like to call this meeting to order.  Before turning to our agenda, I’d like to say a few words about our communications with the public.  Many of you will recall that in June 2011, the FOMC adopted a policy pertaining to the external communications of FOMC participants, and we have reaffirmed that policy every year thereafter.  Principle number one is that every single Committee participant, and not just the Chair, has an obligation to enhance the public’s understanding of monetary policy, including its rationale.  I would urge you to keep this principle in mind, e specially during these highly sensitive times when there i s heightened market volatility and tremendous focus on our ongoing discussions about how and when renormalization might proceed.  If we aren’t careful about what we say in speeches and other forums, such as media interviews, we can easily confuse markets and the general public, adding to volatility and ultimately diminishing the effectiveness and credibility of our policy. Of course, our guidelines affirm that participants are always free to present their own views.  I personally feel that communicating the diversity of views on the Committee, as we also do with the SEP, is valuable, but I consider it important to do that in a way that clearly distinguishes one’s individual view from the Committee’s a greed -upon policy stance.  We have also traditionally emphasized in our communications the collegial, consensus -driven nature of the FOMC policy process, the fact that participants come to meetings with open minds and , after discussing the issues, come to a collective decision.  I see this tradition as a critical aspect of our decision process, and it could be threatened by what strikes me as an increasing tendency for participants to take strong stands in public on ongoing debates about appropriate policy.  If we stake out positions in advance of meetings and we ha ve already decided that it doesn’t matter October 28–29, 20144 of 258what our colleagues have to say, there is no real reason for us to meet at all.  We could save travel expenses by phoning in our votes. But in reality, I suspect that everyone around the table does support the tradition of arriving at the meeting prepared to listen and to reach a collective decision in which most of us don’t get precisely our first choice on policy.  If so, I think the clarity of our communications would be enhanced if discussions about individual views were softened a bit, perhaps by adding a reminder that the ultimate decision will be a collective one and that you look forward to discussing the issues further with your colleagues.  Such qualifiers might also help the public understand that the thinking on the Committee is less fractured than what a range of speeches might suggest. Another concern I have is that the flow of comments on the outlook and policy sometimes takes on the appearance of a public debate in which one participant provides an assessment of the policy implications of some bit of economic news, then another provides a contrasting interpretation, followed by yet other participants weighing in with their views on the correct meaning.  And it is easy to see how such sequences can  arise, especially with reporters trying to spur them on.  While we want to be transparent, I don’t think our communications are necessarily clarified by airing a set of conflicting assessments of the p olicy implications of the latest news.  Rather , it may just confuse the markets by introducing noise, and for this reason, I would encourage you to avoid publicly drawing firm policy conclusions about the meaning of the latest data before we’ve had a chance to talk about them here. I’d also like to make a few remarks pertaining to our comments on the dollar.  By long-standing agreement, the Treasury speaks for the U.S. government on international economic policy and the dollar, while the Fed eral Reserv e speaks for  the U.S. government on monetary October 28–29, 20145 of 258policy.  It  is important to respect this division of labor by carefully limiting our remarks about exchange rates.   We need to be careful not to ever inadvertently create the impression that we are somehow trying to jawbone down the value of the dollar, especially because that would violate the agreement of the G-7 countries not to seek competitive advantage by targeting the value of their currencies.  Such comments could prompt counterproductive policy responses abroad.  Of course, the exchange rate is an important factor for both the economic outlook and monetary policy transmission, so it is hard to avoid all mention of it.  But if we follow a few guidelines, I think we can stay out of trouble. First, we should  avoid commenting on whether the dollar is appropriately valued.  Second, we should not discuss current or prospective exchange market interventions by U.S. authorities.  And, third, I would urge you to limit references to the economic effects of changes in the dollar to situations in which those effects are important and the public would benefit from some discussion of them.  Even in these cases, it might be preferable to point to something more encompassing than exchange rates, such as foreign development s.  Fourth, we want to be clear that the purpose of changes in policies is to achieve the dual mandate, and that any accompanying movements in the dollar, like shifts in bond yields, are a byproduct.  Finally, if asked to comment on the dollar in a situation in which you had no plan to discuss it, I would recommend saying something like, “I don’t have anything for you on that.  As you know, the Treasury speaks for the U.S. government on international economic policy and the dollar.” Thanks for indulging me in  listening to these comments.  I’ll stop there, but I do want to end by noting that a guiding principle of our policy on external communications is that we share a responsibility to enhance the public’s understanding of the Committee’s policy actions and the October 28–29, 20146 of 258"
173,20141217,"Transcript of the Federal Open Market Committee Meeting on  December 16 –17, 2014  December 16 Session   CHAIR YELLEN.  Good afternoon, everyone.  I think we are ready to begin.  T he first item we are going to consider is in a joint Board and FOMC meeting, so I need a motion to close the Board meeting. MR. FISCHER.  So moved. CHAIR YELLEN.  Without objection, thank you.  I’m going to start off by calling on Simon to give us his report on market developments. MR. POTTER.1  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Lorie and I will be splitting the Desk briefing into two parts.  I will discuss financial market developments and some issues related to open market operations.  After questions and answers on this section, Lorie will discuss testing and some related issues with supplementary normalization tools. Over the intermeeting period, U.S. economic data were generally viewed as positive and changes in financial conditions were mixed.  International developments were in focus with more -accommodative policy adopted or communicated by major central banks, driven by concerns over low inflation and weak growth.  Low inflation concerns were amplified by sharp declines in oil prices.  These declines weighed on prices of risk assets linked to energy amid a broad reassessment of the possibility for structurally lower oil prices due to supply -side developments as well as ongoing global growth concerns.  These factors also contributed to an increase in realized and implied volatility across markets late in the intermeeting period.  I thought it would be helpful to look back over the year, as price moves across some major asset classes have been meaningfully different from market expectations at the end of last year.  While large errors in forecasting asset prices should be expected, the constellation of forecast errors for 2014, shown in the top-left panel, is consistent with easier monetary policy abroad than previously anticipated, a positive oil supply shock, and a relative outperformance of the U.S. economy.  The size of the unexpected decline in Treasury yields is particularly striking , given that most believe the Federal Reserve is nearing the start of policy normalization around mid -2015. Over the remainder of this exhibit, I will focus on two aspec ts of domestic markets:  the market -implied path of the target federal funds rate and declines in measures of longer -dated inflation compensation.                                                   1 The materials used by Mr. Potter and Ms. Logan are appended to this transcript (appendix 1).  December 16–17, 20144 of 219The top-right panel shows the market-implied federal funds rate path.  Despite better-than-expected U.S. economic data and some Federal Reserve communications that were perceived as less accommodative than anticipated , market -implied rates changed little on net over the intermeeting period.  Looking back further, the curve has shifted down and flattened substantially since the end of 2013 despite ongoing improvements in domestic labor market conditions and notable upward revisions in Committee participants’ SEP federal  funds rate paths .  This has resulted in a sizable divergence between the market -implied and SEP- projected rate paths.  This divergence can be seen in the middle-left panel, which shows the spreads between median SEP rate projections as of the September meeting and corresponding market -implied rates.  These spreads widened over the course of the year, especially after the September meeting, and are around their widest levels since rate projections were added to the SEP. The Desk’s most recent surveys asked respondents to rate the importance of various factors in explaining the difference between the SE P median dots and the market -implied path.  Dealers and buy-side survey respondents generally assigned the highest importance to different outlooks for the U.S. economy, the view that the SEP median does not represent the Committee’s forecast, and the poss ibility of remaining at the zero lower bound.  Negative term premiums and technical factors were assigned a lower importance.  The middle- right panel uses responses to a range of survey questions, along with the SEP numbers and market- implied rates, to help  further identify the importance of these factors.  The dark blue bars represent the difference between the median SEP dot and the median of the fourth- to seventh-lowest SEP dots, which many market participants believe most closely align with the likely p ath of the policy rate .  These dark blue bars are relatively large, which suggests that a key fact in understanding the spread between the median SEP dot and the market -implied path might be that market participants do not view the median dot as representi ng the future path of the policy rate.  The light blue bars represent the difference between the median of the fourth to seventh dots and the median of Desk survey respondents’ modal path for the target rate.  These differences are quite small, which may indicate that market participants close to the Desk survey median have a similar view as to the outlook for the economy and its implications for the target rate as  the FOMC participants underlying the median of the fourth to seventh dots.  The dark red bars represent the difference between the mean expectation and the modal expectation for the target rate from the Desk’s surveys, which incorporates the perceived possibility of remaining at or returning to the zero lower bound along with other downside risks.  In 2016 and 2017, this accounts for around 30 to 35 basis points of the difference between the median SEP dot and the market -implied rate.  Finally, the light red bars represent the difference between the mean of respondents’ federal funds rate probability distributions and the market- implied rate, a measure of risk premiums in futures rates.  These differences are very small at earlier horizons but increase substantially in 2017 to a negative term premium of around 55 basis points. December 16–17, 20145 of 219In sum, this panel indicates that the spread between the median SEP forecast and the market -implied rate in 2015 and 2016 may be largely due to differences in the perception of the mapping between the SEP dots and the likely path of policy, along with downsi de risks to modal federal  funds rate forecasts.  While the more substantial divergence in 2017 might be of less concern because of the uncertainty around three-year-ahead forecasts, it does line up with the continued decline in medium- and long-dated forwa rd rates.  One explanation for this decline is an increase in the market price associated with certain types of adverse economic shocks, as described in a memo from the staff at the Minneapolis Fed.  The fall in forward rates has been more pronounced in nom inal than real rates, producing large declines in market -based measures of inflation compensation.  The Board staff’s measures of 5 - and 10-year inflation compensation have declined roughly 25 to 30 basis points over the period.  Both the 5- and 10- year breakeven rates, at roughly 1.33 percent and 1.62 percent, respectively, are now at their lowest levels since the height of the euro -area crisis in mid -2010.  In addition, the Board staff’s measure of five -year, five -year-forward inflation compensation, shown in the bottom- left panel, is at its lowest level since late 2008, when TIPS market liquidity was highly strained.  As we noted at the previous meeting, the sharp declines in these market -based inflation measures contrast s with the relative stability of primary dealers’ longer -term inflation expectations, also shown in this panel, and with other survey- based measures.   While not all market measures of forward inflation compensation are as low as the one estimated by Board staff, many of them suggest longer- dated inflation risk premiums are negative under the assumption that long forward inflation expectations remain well anchored near the FOMC’s longer-run inflation objective.  Amid the relative stability of survey -based inflation measures, the Desk surveys again asked respondents to decompose the decline in the market-based five -year, five -year-forward breakeven inflation rate since early September, in an attempt to capture views about sentiments underlying market pricing.  The bottom-right panel shows that dealer and buy-side respondents, on average, attributed roughly half of the decline to lower expected CPI inflation, while the other half was attributed to changes in the inflation risk premium and other risk premiums .  This decomposition is similar to tha t for the October surveys.  Factors cited in the surveys as contributing to lower market inflation expectations include declines in energy prices, appreciation of the U.S. dollar, and concerns about global growth and inflation.  More marginally, some market participants have cited concerns that the Federal Reserve may tighten policy before the economy is sufficiently resilient to withstand higher interest rates.  Some have also suggested that the deteriorating TIPS market liquidity may be a factor behind the  narrowing in breakeven inflation rates.  However, Desk analysis suggests there was relatively little change in market functioning over most of the intermeeting period, though poor liquidity may have exacerbated the particularly pronounced drop in breakeven inflation rates late last week.

174,20150128,"January 27–28, 20154 of 361Transcript of the Federal Open Market Committee Meeting on January 27–28, 2015 January 27 Session CHAIR YELLEN.  Good morning, everyone.  As you may have noted, we have a very full agenda for this meeting.  In addition to quite a bit of normal beginning-of-the- year organizational business, I’m hoping for a thorough discussion of several important topics relating to normalization that should serve to prepare us for decisions we may face in the months ahead.  But before we turn to that agenda, I’d like to welcome Presidents Evans, Lacker, Lockhart, and Williams back to the Committee and note that this is the last FOMC meeting for both Presidents Fisher and Plosser. Tomorrow, as you know, we will have a farewell luncheon in honor of President Plosser, and, in the spring, we’ll have a farewell meal for President Fisher .  We’ll have a chance to thank each of them for their service then. But I’d like to take this opportunity to briefly thank them here as well.  President Fisher st arted attending FOMC meetings in 2005 and has since participated in 78 regular meetings.  He brought to this table unique perspectives based on decades of experience as a market participant and as a senior government official. He regularly reported at thi s table economic insights reflecting information gleaned from his deep set of contacts across the country and the globe, and few of us will ever forget his imaginative metaphors.  [Laughter] President Plosser began attending FOMC meetings in 2006 and has s ince participated in 69 regular meetings.  He brought with him rich academic experience in macroeconomic research, including a long list of publications covering a wide range of topics.  With this deep experience paired with a sharp intellect , he regularly challenged  this group to think rigorously and communicate clearly.January 27–28, 20155 of 361Both President Fisher and President Plosser have helped steer this Committee and the American economy through some of the most challenging and tumultuous times in several generations. Richard and Charlie, let me say that we thank you for your service and want you to know that you will be missed. MR. PLOSSER.  Thank you. MR. FISHER.  Thank you. [Applause] CHAIR YELLEN.  Now let’s turn to our first agenda item, which is the election of Commi ttee officers.  Following long-established precedent, I’m going to ask Governor Fischer to handle the nominations of Chair and Vice Chair. MR. FISCHER.  Thank you.  I’ll be calling for two sets of nominations and votes.  F irst, I’d like to ask for a nomina tion for Committee Chair. MR. TARULLO .  I nominate Janet Yellen. MR. FISCHER.  Is there a second? MR. POWELL.  I second that nomination. MR. FISCHER.  Any other nominations or discussion? We should try it out.  [Laughter] Without objection.  N ow I’d like to ask for a nomination for the position of Committee Vice Chair. MR. TARULLO .  I nominate Bill Dudley. MR. FISCHER.  Is there a second? MR. POWELL.  I second that nomination. MR.

175,20150318,"March 17–18, 20154 of 239Transcript of the Federal Open Market Committee Meeting on March  17–18, 2015 March  17 Session CHAIR YELLEN.  Good morning, everybody.  As you know, we had a farewell luncheon for President Plosser at the January meeting .  And in a couple of hours, we will also have a chance to say farewell to President Fisher at a luncheon.  In light of those departures, I would like to welcome Helen Holcomb back to the table.  She represented the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas here before President Fisher took off ice and will be representing the Dallas Bank again today.  I would also like to welcome Blake Prichard to the table, representing the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia.  He is serving as acting president of the Philadelphia Bank until Patrick Harker tak es office on July 1. Before we begin today’s agenda, I want to briefly update you about developments that relate to press briefings.  At recent meetings , we have discussed the fact that it is important for the Committee not to feel constrained from taking action whenever we deem appropriate, at any meeting, regardless of whether there is a postmeeting press conference scheduled.  And a number of you have suggested to me that I schedule press conferences after every meeting.  Now, a decision to have press conferences at every meeting is likely to be irreversible. It is something I have, therefore, carefully considered.  For now, at least, I think my decision is that it would be best not to schedule press conferences after every meeting. Let me just say that,  by way of explanation, the time that is required for me and all of our senior staff to prepare for these press conferences is truly nontrivial. In part, that is because preparations involve being up- to-date not only on matters pertaining to monetary poli cy and the economy, but also on all matters pertaining to Federal Reserve -related issues.  And all of that preparation occurs at exactly the same time when all of us are preparing for these meetings.March 17–18, 20155 of 239As I reflect on it—and, again, this is just a decision for now, so I am not saying this can’t be revisited —it seems to me that when we are in a more normal mode for conducting monetary policy, and I hope that time is not too far off, and the economic environment is more normal, every -meeting press conferences, especially aft er meetings for which there are no forecast updates, are really not likely to have much focus on monetary policy decisions and the economy. What I believe will happen is they will become opportunities for the media  to explore a host of nonmonetary policy issues, which ultimately could be a distraction rather than a help to us.  That would all occur on meeting days.  But , at the same time, th ough I am not inclined now to go to press conferences every meeting, I do think it is important for us to feel —and also to convince the public and market participants—that we are not constrained from taking decisions at meetings for which there is not a subsequent press conference, so that market expectations of our future actions can be appropriately responsive to incoming data. As I have mentioned in the past, we have long had the capability to conduct press briefings by telephone on very short notice.  Chairman Bernanke did so a number of times during the financial crisis.  So the plan I would like to propose is that we remind the public, the markets, and the press that we have that capability and would indeed use it when necessary.  And, to firm up that expectation, late on the second day of our meeting in April, the Board’s Public Affairs office plans t o conduct a test of our system for media conference calls. We will permit news organizations to report afterward that we conducted this test, and we will state that the reason for the test is to refresh news organizations’ familiarity with how the system works, so that we can use it, if necessary, on meeting days when no press conference is scheduled.   That is currently the plan, and I welcome any input that any of you would like to offer on it.  But that is what we thought, for the moment.March 17–18, 20156 of 239Let’s now turn to the agenda.  T he first two items will be considered in a joint meeting with the Board of Governors, so we need a Board vote to close that meeting.  Do I have a motion? MR. FISCHER.  So moved , Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Without objection.  I am going to call on Simon Potter to begin the Desk report. MR. POTTER.1  Thank you, Madam Chair. We will be splitting the Desk briefing in two parts .  I will talk about financial market developments, then Lorie will talk about Desk operations. Over the intermeeting period, the backdrop of monetary policy easing overseas, relative stability in oil prices, and some positive global economic data reportedly contributed to a reduction in perceived downside global growth risks. Longer-dated forward interest rates among major developed economies diverged over the period, as shown in the top-left panel of your first exhibit.  The trend of declining longer-run nominal interest rates since the start of 2014 partially retraced itself in the United State s and United Kingdom, as some incoming economic data, most notably employment reports, reinforced expectations that the Federal Reserve and Bank of England will begin normalizing policy within the next year. The top-right panel shows a summation of daily changes in U.S. yields over the period, bucketed into a few categories based on market commentary.  Increases in both short- and longer-dated yields occurred on days with stronger- than-expected U.S. employment reports and higher- than-expected inflation data, among other factors.  These influences in combination more than offset the declines in rates that follow ed the start of ECB purchases and Federal Reserve communications including the January statement, minutes, and the Chair’s testimony before the Congre ss. These Federal Reserve communications were generally interpreted as slightly more accommodative than expected due to discussion of the balance of risks around the start of normalization and the outlook for persistently low inflation.  However, not all market participants interpreted Federal Reserve commentary as more accommodative than expected. Many market participants expect policy normalization to begin in the second or third quarter of 2015.  This is shown in the middle- left panel, which indicates t hat the average probability assigned to liftoff occurring in June or September increased modestly from the January surveys.  This panel also shows that the distribution of individual beliefs about liftoff timing is dispersed, consistent with some of the 1 The materials used by Mr. Potter and Ms. Logan are appended to this transcript (appendix 1)."
176,20150429,"April 28–29, 20154 of 229Transcript of the Federal Open Market Committee Meeting on April 28 –29, 2015 April 28 Session CHAIR YELLEN.  Good afternoon, everyone.  I’d like to welcome back First Vice President s Holcomb and Prichard, who will again be representing Dallas and Philadelphia, respectively. On a sad note, my understanding is that this is the last FOMC meeting for New York First Vice President Chris Cumming.  Chris has attended 92 FOMC meetings, 70 of which she attended as an alternate voter .  And, as all of you know, Chris has been involved in a wide array of System work over many years in all facets of what we do and has been a very wonderful colleague.  Chris, I really thank you for your service and want you to know that you will be very much missed.   [Applause] Next, I’m pleased to let you know that Brian Madigan has agreed to return to the Board’s Division of Monetary Affairs as deputy director , reporting to Thomas, effective June 1.  I think all of  you know that Brian served as director of the division and as FOMC secretary  from 2007 to 2010.  Since he retired from the Board, Brian has been a visiting professor in the Department of Economics at Georgetown University . Now, as I think many of you know , in recent years, the job of director of the Division of Monetary Affairs has become increasingly burdensome.  It has entailed serving as the Committee’s chief monetary policy advisor, as s ecretary of the FOMC, and as leader of a large organization with c ritical responsibilities.   As part of a strategy to create a more sustainable situation, Brian will have oversight responsibility for the FOMC Secretariat and will play a key role in the production of the minutes and transcripts of FOMC meetings.  Obviously, these are things he has done superbly well in the past and for which he is eminently well qualified.April 28–29, 20155 of 229Accordingly, I intend to propose that Brian be appointed by the FOMC as its s ecretary .  Unless there are objections, I will ask the FOMC Secretariat to send out a request in early June for notation votes to select Brian as our s ecretary .  Under this arrangement, Thomas will continue to serve as the Committee’s primary advisor on monetary policy and will also be able to dedicate more of his energy to ensuring that the Division of Monetary Affairs fulfills its critical role in supporting our monetary policy and other responsibilities. Okay.  Now, the first two items on our agenda today will be considered in a joint meeting of the FOMC and the Board of Governors, and, accordingly, I need a motion to close the Board meeting. MR. FISCHER.  So moved. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Without objection.  O ur first item is financial developments and open market operations, and let me call on Simon to delive r the Desk report. MR. POTTER.1  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Lorie and I will split the briefing into three parts. First, I will review financial market developments. Next, Lorie will review Desk operations.  Finally, I will discuss staff work on enhancing the calculation methodology for the federal funds effective rate. Over the intermeeting period, domestic financial conditions eased following more -accommodative- than-expected U.S. monetary policy communications and weaker -than- expected  economic data, including the March employment report.  On net, nominal Treasury rates declined by as many as 25 basis points, the S&P 500 index gained 2 percent, and the DXY dollar index decreased nearly 3 percent. A substantial portion of these changes came around the time o f the March FOMC events, which were characterized as being more  accommodative than expected despite the removal of “patient” language from the statement. Investors pointed, in particular, to the large downward shift in the target federal funds rate projections in the SEP and, to a lesser extent, the downward revisions to Committee participants ’ projections of inflation, GDP growth, and the longer-run unemployment rate.  The left column of your top- left panel shows that nominal and real interest rates declined in the one-hour window around the statement and SEP releases , while measures of inflation compensation rose, equity prices increased, and the dollar weakened. As shown in the right column of the table, the absolute magnitudes of these moves were 1 The materials used by Mr. Potter and Ms. Logan are appended to this tran script (appendix 1).April 28–29, 20156 of 229very large relative to changes in one-hour windows around FOMC statement releases over the past decade. One hypothesis for seeing moves of this magnitude could be decreased market liquidity.  Indeed , late in the trading session outside the window use d to measure these FOMC announcement effects, there was a very large move in the euro ‒dollar currency pair.  The move pushed the intraday trading range for the currency pair to over 4 percent, a 5 standard deviation move over the period since 2004, as shown in the top-right panel.  The size of the move is comparable to the 6 standard deviation range in the 10-year Treasury yield on October 15, both of which took place amid very high volumes.  The March FOMC events shifted out expectations for the timing of liftoff according to the Desk surveys, as shown in the middle-left panel.  The “flash” survey, taken three business days after the March FOMC meeting , suggests that most of the shift occurred in response to the meeting and the large price moves in the hour following the March FOMC statement release, therefore likely reflect ing shifting policy expectations as opposed to outsized liquidity effects.  Since the flash survey, soft domestic economic data and speeches from Federal Reserve officials appear to have further solidified this shift in policy expectations. The April surveys also showed a notably slower expected pace of policy normalization after liftoff. The middle -right panel shows that the probability distribution for the pace of tightening in the fir st year after liftoff, assuming no return to the zero bound, shifted toward a slower pace over the period, the first notable shift in these views since th e question was originally asked last September.  A similar shift occurred in the distribution of the expected pace of tightening in the second year after liftoff. In considering when the Federal Reserve will begin to normalize monetary policy, market participants are particularly focused on the outlook for inflation and the Committee’s reasonable confidence that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective.  We asked survey respondents to score the importance of various factors they believe the Committee will use in assessing whether reasonable confidence in the inflation outlook has been achieved.  As shown in the bottom-left panel, respondents assigned the most importance to a further improvement in the labor market and the absence of weakening in realized core inflation.  Over the intermeeting period, market- based measures of inflation compensation increased alongside higher energy prices and a weaker U.S. dollar, as shown in the bottom-right panel.  Forward measures of inflation compensation increased at both shorter- and longer -dated horizons but remain below levels at the end of 2013.  The increa ses over the period were attributed to the March FOMC communications, somewhat higher- than-expected realized inflation, the increase in oil prices, and positioning dynamics in the TIPS market.  Longer- term inflation expectations from Desk surveys were little changed over the period.  Meanwhile, front-month Brent crude increased nearly 22 percent but remains more than 40 percent lower since the"

I would like to, again, welcome First Vice Presidents Holcomb and Prichard, who are representing Dallas and Philadelphia. My understanding is that Patrick Harker will take office as president of the Feder al Reserve Bank of Philadelphia on July 1.  So this is likely to be Blake’s last meeting, and I want to thank you very much for representing Philadelphia today and at the most recent  two meetings. I’d also like to welcome back Brian Madigan, who has been selected through notation vote to serve as Secretary of the FOMC for a term that began on June 4.  As I mentioned at the previous meeting, Brian will have oversight responsibility for the FOMC Secretariat and will be playing a key role in the production of minutes and transcripts of the FOMC meetings.  These are duties that Brian has ably performed in the past and is uniquely qualified to fulfill.  And, obviously, Brian is no stranger to this room. Finally, I ’d like to also welcome Michael Str ine to his first FOMC meeting.  Michael, who currently serves as an executive vice president and head of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Corporate Group, will become the first vice presid ent of the New York Fed on July 1 and will also become an alternate voter of this Committee at that point.   So, Brian and Michael, welcome, and we look forward to working with both of you. Let’s turn now to our agenda, and the first item is going to be the Desk report.  But before we do that, we’re going to be considering this first topic in a joint meeting of the FOMC and the Board, as usual.  So I need a motion to close the Board meeting. MR. FISCHER.  So moved.June 16–17, 20155 of 215CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Without objection.  And now, let me call on Simon to deliver the Desk report. MR. POTTER.1  Thank you, Madam Chair. Over the inte rmeeting period, the 10-year Treasury yield increased 39 basis points, moving in tandem with a more pronounced 67 basis point rise in the 10-year German yield.  The moves were concentrated in longer-dated forwards and occurred after German interest rates had reached historically low levels, as shown in the top -left panel of your first exhibit.  This rise in nominal forward rates largely retraced the declines that began after last year’s Jackson Hole speech by  ECB President Draghi and continued through the start of QE in the euro area earlier this year. The size and speed of the moves in long rates were similar to the so -called taper tantrum in 2013.  However, as I’ll discuss in a bit, these moves had more lim ited knock- on effects across financial markets. Recent U.S. data releases suggested to contacts that disappointing Q1 economic growth may have been largely due to transitory factors, but the data generally were not seen as sufficiently strong to prompt the Committee to start the normalization process at the June or July meetings. On average, buy- side and primary dealer respondents to the Desk’s June surveys assigned a near -zero probability to liftoff occurring at this meeting and reduced the odds assigned to the July meeting, as shown in the top-right panel.  The average probability assigned to liftoff in September or later increased for both groups.  The vast majority of respondents to our surveys put the probability of a liftoff in September somewhere between 30 and 70 percent. Beyond liftoff, survey respondents’ modal and mean expectations for the level of the federal funds rate over the next several years were little changed. The market -implied path of the federal funds rate in the very near term was also little changed over the period, though the path two to three years ahead shifted up slightly, as shown in the middle-left panel.  The path remains far lower and flatter than at the end of 2013 and is substantially below the median of the March SE P federal funds rate projections for 2016 and 2017.  Desk survey respondents expect the means of the rate projections to decline in the June SEP; they also expect the dispersion of projections across FOMC participants to narrow. The upward shift in the market-implied path, alongside relatively steady survey expectations, suggests that the rise in market rates over the period was  due to an increase in near -dated term premiums. Indeed, the difference between the end -2017 market -implied rate and the mean PDF -implied fed eral funds rate expectation obtained from the Desk surveys—a measure of the term premium at this horizon — became less negative over the intermeeting period for both buy- and sell -side respondents, as shown in the middle-right panel.  The increase  in these near-dated 1 The materials used by Mr. Potter are appended to this transcript (appendix 1).June 16–17, 20156 of 215term premiums may stem from reduced concerns over negative shocks and from higher interest rates abroad. The Desk surveys suggest that the rise in longer- dated U.S. Treasury yields was also due to increased term premiums, as shown in the bottom-left panel.  In particular, when asked to decompose the 36 basis  point change in the 10- year rate between April 28 and June 3, survey respondents on average ascribed 23 basis points, or 63 percent of the move, to a rise in the term premium, which , in their qualitative comments , was linked to spillover from European markets.  On average, respondents attributed 9 basis points, or one-quarter of the move, to higher expected average real policy rate s.  There was only a minimal attribution given to a higher expected average inflation rate. The s taff’s term -structure models also attribute most of the move to movements in term premiums. As shown in the left half of the bottom-right panel, nearly all of the 42 basis point rise in U.S. forward nominal rates over the period came from higher real yields, with forward measures of domestic inflation compensation relatively little changed. The right half of the panel shows that real rates also accounted for most of the move in the euro- area rates.  Inflation compensation accounted for a slightly larger portion of the European rate moves in comparison to the United S tates, as recent higher euro- area realized core inflation reportedly reduced the odds some assigned t o very low longer-run inflation outcomes in the region.  Market participants attributed the rise in euro -area real rates largely to higher term premiums. Market participants highlighted a number of technical factors that likely exacerbated the rise in euro -area yields.  Many noted a reduction or reversal of extended long positions by momentum -driven lever aged investors, whose assets under management have grown substantially over recent years.  In addition, higher euro- area interest rate volatility may have caused investors who rely on value- at-risk models to pare back their holdings.  The top-left panel of your next exhibit shows this volatility using the 30-day average intraday trading range on the 10-year bund yield, which rose to its highest levels in three years.  Over the period, Draghi noted that market participants “should get used to periods of higher volatility,” and contacts reported that this stated comfort with recent moves contributed to further upward pressure on rates.  During the sharp rate moves and since the onset of the ECB’s asset purchases, anecdotal reports from Desk counterparties indicate that liquidity conditions in the euro- area fixed -income markets have deteriorated, though this is not borne out in liquidity metrics we typically moni tor. However, the rise in interest rates has decreased the amount of European securities trading with negative yields and alleviated some associated challenges for investors.  I ndeed, there are a greater number of positive- yielding securities available for reinvestment from SOMA’s maturing euro-denominated bond holdings. The sharp rise in longer- term rates over the period has drawn comparisons with the taper tantrum of 2013, with some even labeling the selloff in euro- area rates as the “bund tantrum.”  However, the deterioration in risk sentiment evidenced across a"

I’d also like to welcome Patrick Harker to his first FOMC meeting.  I think everyb ody knows that earlier this month, Pat became president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia.  He brings with him a distinguished record in academic research, many years of experience leading large and important institutions, and a long history of service on a wide range of corporate and nonprofit boards, including the board of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia starting in 2012. L et me just say , on behalf of everyone here, we ’re all looking forward to working with you in the years ahead. MR. HARK ER.  Thank you, Madam Chair . CHAIR YELLEN.  Now, turning to our agenda, the first two items today are going to be considered in a joint meeting of the Board of Governors and the FOMC.  A Board vote is going to be needed to close the meeting.  So do I have a motion to close the Board meeting? MR. FISCHER. So moved. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Without objection.  Our first item on the agenda is financial developments and open market operations, and Simon is going to begin. MR. POTTER.1  Thank you, Madam Chair. Lorie and I will again be splitting the Desk briefing in two parts: I will first discuss financial market developments , and Lorie will then discuss Desk operations and balance sheet developments. 1 The materials used by Mr. Potter and Ms. Logan are appended to this transcript (appendix 1).July 28–29, 20155 of 265The intermeeting period was characterized by pronounced shifts in risk sentiment and bouts of volatility in some overseas markets largely driven by events in Greece and China.  However, volatility in domestic financial m arkets was not unusually large. The top-left panel of your first exhibit shows important events over the intermeeting period, marked with dashed lines.  The June FOMC statement and SEP release, line 1, resulted in a slight decline in Treasury yields and was largely overshadowed by developments in Greece and China, lines 2 through 5.  On net, both equit y pric es and longer- dated Treasury yields were relatively little changed over the period. Treasury yields generally fell on days featuring  FOMC communications or top-tier domestic economic data releases , as shown in the top- right panel. Market participants highlighted the downward shift in the June SEP “dots” and below-expectations inflation, employment, and retail sales data as main factors driving the declines.  In contrast, yields increased, on net, other than in these days, as captured by the “other” category .  This category includes days when developments abroad were the main focus. Domestic monetary policy communications and data, along with overseas developments, shifted the perceived bala nce of risks toward a slightly later liftoff.  While, on average, respondents to the Desk’s dealer and buy- side surveys attach the highest odds to liftoff occurring in September, as shown in the middle- left panel, the average probability assigned to this outcome declined slightly from the June surveys. The associated increase in the odds placed on a later liftoff was spread roughly evenly across future meetings, and the average probability of liftoff is now more than 20 percent for both the December meetin g and for meetings thereafter. A small number of Desk survey respondents noted that the potential for strained year-end liquidity conditions might make the Committee reluctant to lift off in December. The survey probability of a September liftoff is gener ally in line with probabilities implied by market prices, shown in the middle-right panel.  These probabilities, derived from fed eral funds futures contracts, declined following the June FOMC events and were then , on net, little changed over the remainder of the period.  Of course, backing out physical probabilities from market prices is a highly imperfect endeavor and requires numerous assumptions.  In addition, one now needs to make an assumption about where market participants believe the effective feder al funds rate will trade in the target range.  The dark blue line in the panel uses the median expectation of 10 basis points above the bottom of the range from a question in the Desk surveys, while the light blue lines use the interquartile range of these expectations.  The shaded region is based on the full set of responses to the Desk surveys, reflecting a possible range of probabilities that may be drawn from market prices.July 28–29, 20156 of 265Market participants generally continue to believe the pace of tightening will be gradual, in line with recent communications from Federal Reserve officials.  Thomas will discuss this more in his briefing. One factor contributing to the gradual expected pace of tightening has been subdued readings of realized inflation.  Market -based m easures of forward inflation remain notably below longer-run historical averages, as shown in the bottom- left panel, though they have increased somewhat since the start of the year as energy prices bottomed out and inflation readings stabilized.  Over this intermeeting period, forward inflation measures remained relatively steady despite a decline of 14 percent in front-month Brent crude oil futures, in contrast to the highly correlated moves seen over the past year.  Longer-dated oil futures also declined.   The recent drop in oil prices appears to have been partly driven both by higher-than- expected supply from Saudi Arabia and Iraq and by expectations for increased supply from Iran over the longer run after an agreement with major international po wers cleared the way for sanctions to be lifted.  The decline in oil prices caused high -yield corporate credit spreads for energy-related firms to increase over the period.  Credit spreads outside the high-yield energy sector also widened somewhat. Yields on benchmark Puerto Rico general obligation bonds also rose sharply, as shown in the bottom-right panel.  This occurred after the Puerto Rican government indicated that its public debt burden was unsustainable and that significant concessions from its cred itors would be necessary.  The panel also shows that spillover to other municipal markets has thus far been limited. As discussed  in one of your boxes in Tealbook A , risks associated with Puerto Rico at present appear manageable but warrant continued monitoring. Turning to your next exhibit, the top- left panel shows that the DXY dollar index increased 2 percent during the period.  The dollar initially appreciated as investors focused on risks from the euro area and China and, more recently , from the ongoing backdrop of monetary policy divergence across major economies. Dollar strength and concerns over Chinese economic growth reportedly contributed to declines in industrial metals prices and commodity- linked currencies over the period.  The Bloomberg indust rial metals index fell nearly 8 percent and developed economy commodity-sensitive currencies, including the Australian and Canadian dollars as well as the Norwegian krone, depreciated an average of 6 percent against the dollar. Some market participants suggested that commodity price declines for industrial metals were exacerbated by the sharp fall in Chinese equit y pric es through a financing linkage.  These commodities had reportedly been used by some as collateral to obtain margin financing and were subsequently sold to meet margin calls amid the equity market declines. The Shanghai Composite index declined roughly 17 percent over the period, as shown in the top-right panel, and, after  taking into account the past two days, is down almost 30 percent from its peak.  This peak represented a 150 percent increase since last July. As I discussed at the June meeting, conventional easing measures by the"

I would like to welcome Rob Kaplan to his first FOMC meeting.  Rob became president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas just last week .  In his new role, President Kaplan brings to bear 10 years of academic experience at Harvard University , where he served as a professor and a dean ; a long and distinguished career in global finance; and broad experience on corporate and noncorporate boards.  I have to say , you chose to join us at a very interesting time.  [Laughter]  W e all look forward to working with you. MR. KAPLAN.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I appreciate it. CHAIR YELLEN. Let me mention , as was indicated in the agenda, that the entire FOMC meeting  will be conducted jointly as an FOMC and Board of Governors meeting—and this will likely be true going forward .  I need a motion to close the Board meeting. MR. FISCHER.  So moved. CHAIR YELLEN.   Thank you.  And without objection. Our first item of business is “Financial Developments and Open M arket Operations.” L et me call on Simon to give us the Desk report. MR. POTTER.1  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Over the intermeeting period, a sharp rise in concern about emerging market growth, particularly in China, triggered a broad decline in global risk- sensitive assets.  Oil and other commodity prices fell, at times reaching levels last observed in early 2009, and inflation compensation measures in the U nited States  and other advanced economies continued to decline.  Most emerging market currencies depreciated, in some cases quite sharply.  Nominal Treasury yields were relatively little changed, reportedly in part because flight- to-quality demand was offset by large- scale reserve sales by emerging market central banks, which intervened heavily in foreign exchange markets in a bid to stabilize the value of their currencies.  Toward the end of the period, as U.S. markets calmed 1 The materials used by Mr. Potter and Ms. Logan are appended to this transcript (appendix 1).September 16–17, 20155 of 240down, investors were intensely focused on the prospects for Federal Reserve policy firming in light of the positive news on U.S. real activity during the intermeeting period. I will begin by discussing these financial market developments.  Lorie will then discuss money market developments and operational matters. The People’s Bank of China unexpectedly devalued the renminbi versus the dollar following a long period of stability and predictability in the management of that exchange rate, as shown in the top-left panel of your first exhibit.  Although the devaluation was relatively small compared with the increase in China’s trade-weighted exchange rate over the past year, it came on the heels of a string of weak Chinese economic data and the unwinding, at least in part, of a bubble in Chinese equities.  The devaluation appeared to intensify greatly the existing concerns among market participants about the severity of the growth slowdown in China and the ability of the Chinese authorities to address it appropri ately .  Sentiment toward Chinese policymaking had already been fragile, especially in light of the often heavy-handed and ultimately unsuccessful effort over the past few months to halt the selloff in equities.  Following the devaluation, capital outflows from China accelerated markedly from already high levels.  These outflows led, within a couple of days, to large -scale foreign exchange intervention to prevent further renminbi depreciation. The concerns raised by the devaluation, along with a number of si gnificant developments in other emerging markets that I will discuss later, contributed to a broad selloff in global risk assets.  As shown in the top-right panel, equity price indexes in both emerging and developed economies declined sharply.  The S&P 500 index fell by more than 10 percent over a two -day period before recovering somewhat and is about 7 percent lower , on net, over the period. Nominal Treasury yields changed only modestly over the period, and real yields actually increased somewhat at most t enors.  The middle- left panel shows a decomposition of the changes in forward nominal rates into real and inflation compensation components.  Some market participants expressed surprise that nominal yields did not  fall substantially and found the rise in real yields incongruous with the decline in global risk sentiment and flight- to-quality effects that are ordinarily expected to push yields down in such circumstances. Many market participants believe that this relative stability in nominal yields reflects the downward pressure of typical flight- to-quality flows being offset by upward pressure stemming from sizable sales of Treasuries by Chinese and other emerging market reserve managers intervening to support their currencies.  Your middle-right panel presents information about Chinese intervention activity.  PBOC official reserve data for August showed a decline in reserve holdings of about $100 billion.  Many market pa rticipants believe that this figure might understate the scale of Chinese sales—for example, by omitting intervention via foreign exchange derivatives —and estimate that the PBOC’s  intervention might have been up to $200 billion last month.  Contacts believe that the PBOC funded outrightSeptember 16–17, 20156 of 240interventions in large part via sales of shorter-dated, off-the- run nominal Treasury securities, and , as Lorie will discuss later, primary dealers’ inventories of these securities rose rapidly.  In addition, the PBOC was reportedly active in a range of other assets and across a variety of other currency pairs. Market participants generally expect continued high levels of intervention to stem depreciation pressures on the renminbi, with some expecting that intervention could total several hundred billion dollars through the spring of next year.  The combined effect of these actual and anticipated sales probably will put significant upward pressure on Treasury yields, although it is difficult to quantify the effects.  Chinese officials appear to be hoping that various recently introduced so- called macroprudential measures will stem capital outflows and reduce the corresponding need for further FX intervention and asset sales to stabilize the currency at around its current level. However, investors appear skeptical that these measures will have much effect on capital flows, which are thought to be motivated by expectations for further renminbi depreciation and a loss of confidence in the Chinese economic outlook. As further evidence of the possible effect  of intervention on U.S. Treasuries, market participants have pointed to a narrowing of swap spreads—the difference between interest rate swap rates and cash Treasury yields—shown in the lower- left panel.  According to this argument, the narrowing of swap spreads reflects underperformance of Treasuries versus other fixed -income assets in large part due to the concentrated flow of Treasury sales by reserve managers.  The narrowing has been most notable in short- dated tenors , in which the majority of reserve selling has likely taken place. Concern about a slowdown in China and other emerging markets also drove a steep decline in oil and other commodity prices.  As shown in the lower-right panel, oil prices fell 13 percent on net over the period amid very high volatility.  In addition to demand- related concerns, the decline in commodity prices also partly reflects expectations for oil production, both by OPEC member countries and by shale-exploration firms, to respond to recent price dec lines more slowly and to a lesser extent than earlier believed, as well as expectations for a significant rise in oil exports from Iran following the lifting of trade sanctions . Declines in commodity prices, the surprise renminbi devaluation, and concern about fragility in many emerging economies have contributed to a significant decrease in emerging market asset prices, most notably in commodity -exporting economies.  The top-left panel of your next exhibit illustrates the relationship between countries’ in termeeting currency performance, on the vertical axis, against the share of their exports that come from commodities, on the horizontal axis.  This panel shows that countries for which energy is a more important export experienced larger currency depreciations ; for example, the currencies in the lower -right quadrant depend most on energy exports and exhibited the largest depreciation.  These large exchange rate moves appear to reflect concern about the effect of sizable changes in the terms of trade on the economic health and fiscal, financial, political, and social"

Let’s get started.  As most of you know, this is the last FOMC meeting for President Kocherlakota.  Later today we will have a chance to thank him and to wish him farewell at a luncheon, but in view of Narayana’s service on the Federal Open Market Committee, I’d like to take this opportunity to thank him in the setting of an FOMC meeting as well. Narayana became presid ent of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis in October 2009.  He has participated in 54 regular meetings of the FOMC.  Before becoming president, he was a highly successful economic researcher while serving as a university professor and as a research consultant for the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis.   The insight and creativity that he demonstrated as a researcher were also hallmarks of his work as a monetary policymaker.  Over the past six years , President Kocherlakota has contributed greatly to th e Committee’s formulation of monetary policies to address the challenging macroeconomic issues facing our nation.  So, Narayana, let me say thank you in this venue for your service and say how much we will all miss you.  [Applause] MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank  you very much, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  And , as we did the previous time and probably will from now on, our meetings will be throughout joint meetings of the FOMC and the Board of Governors.  I need a motion to close the Board meeting. MR. FISCHER.  So moved. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Without objection.  The first topic on our agenda is “Equilibrium Real Interest Rates,” r*. Let me ask Chris Gust to start us off.October 27–28, 20155 of 289MR. GUST.1  Our briefing will be delivered in four segments by Kei-Mu Yi, Andrea Tambalotti, David López- Salido , and me. We will be referring to the package labeled “Material for Briefing on Equilibrium Real Interest Rates. ” What level of  the real policy rate would be consistent with moving the economy to, or keeping it at, full e mployment?  This benchmark rate is often referred to as the “neutral” or “equilibrium” real rate, or r *. A policy stance that sets the real policy rate equal to r* is, in some models, neither contractionary nor expansionary.  This general concept of a neutral real rate has been given several more -specific definitions, which I will summarize.  Kei -Mu, Andrea, and David will focus on longer- run trends in r*, on shorter- run variations in r*, and on the policy implications of having to rely on uncertain estimates of r*. Exhibit 1 identifies different concepts that have been referred to as r *—that is, different definitions of a “neutral” real rate.  Some have a very specific interpretation that is tightly linked to a model or class of models; others are statistical in nature. The first three entries in the list are associated with formal economic models. The natural, or Wicksellian , real rate is the real interest rate that would prevail in the absence of nominal rigidities such as sticky prices and wages.  Thus, it is the real rate consistent with the level of resource utilization that would prevail if there were no nominal rigidities .  The efficient real rate is the real rate that would prevail if there were neither nominal rigidities nor dis tortions such as impe rfect competition or taxes that move allocations away from their efficient level s.  The optimal real rate is the rate that would be prescribed by optimal monetary policy based on maximizing some welfare criterion .  It may differ from t he efficient rate if policy is constrained by the effective lower bound or if there are not enough policy instruments to achieve the most efficient outcomes .  The real rate associated with the optimal control simulations presented in Tealbook B is one exam ple of an optimal real rate. The natural, efficient, and optimal real rates are short- term concepts.  Estimates of these rates fluctuate in response to economic shocks and move over the business cycle. In the simplest New Keynesian model, these three r * concepts are equivalent, and it is optimal for policymakers to set the short- term real interest rate equal to the natural rate in order to stabilize the price level and keep output at potential.  In larger, more realistic New Keynesian models, these three concepts need not coincide; nonetheless, as Andrea will discuss, a monetary policy strategy in which the real policy rate tracks the natural rate generally leads to beneficial economic outcomes. Continuing down the list, a focus on the long- run average real rate takes r* to be the average of some short- term real interest rate measured over a long period of time. This definition is statistical and does not rely on a specific economic model.  By contrast, estimating the steady -state real interest rate, which is the short- term real interest rate that would prevail in the long  run once all shocks die down, requires a fully specified economic model.  The se two concept s are often used interchangeably 1 The materials used by M essrs. Gust, Yi, Tambalotti , and López-Salido are appended to this transcript (appendix 1).October 27–28, 20156 of 289in simple policy rules that are based on an assumed fixed long-run or steady- state real rate and thus have a constant intercept term.  However, as Kei- Mu will explain, treating the long- run real rate as fixed, as is often assumed in the formulation of simple policy rules, does not appear to be realistic. FRB/US r*, whi ch is shown in the Monetary Policy Strategies section of Tealbook B, is a different, though related, concept of r*. It provides a medium-run perspective on r* and is the level of the federal funds rate that, if maintained for 12 quarters, will close the o utput gap in three years. One can employ the “ real rate gap,” which is the gap between the actual real interest rate and r*, as an  indicator of the stance of monetary policy .  For example, if the path of the actual r eal rate lies persistently below the path for a short-run concept of r*, output would eventually exceed potential. I will now turn it over to Kei-Mu, who will discuss long- run trends in the real rate. MR. YI. Thank you.  In this presentation I will summarize aspects of the memo that Jing Zhang and I wrote on the evolution of long- run real interest rates and their fundamental determinants. The two real interest rates relevant to our memo are defined again in the top panel of exhibit 2. Why should policymakers care about these longer- run interest rates— the term I will use to describe both? There are four related reasons, shown in the middle panel.  First, optimal monetary policy requires specifying a path for the real federal funds rate.  This , in turn, requires estimates of the future path of short-run r *. Longer- run real rates characterize the future path of short -run r * once short- and medium-run shocks die down—these rates thus serve as (time- varying) reference points for short-run r *. Second, the intercept term in a Taylor-type policy rule typically is set equal to the longer- run real interest rate.  Third, estimates of longer-run real interest rates can suggest when it is appropriate to change the long -run assumptions implicit in estimates of short-run r *.  Finally, estimates of longer-run real interest rates can shed light on the probability of hitting the effective lower bound, or ELB. The bottom panel provides an outline of our presentation. In exhibit 3, we present our estimates of long- run real interest rates, which are constructed as 1 1-year centered moving averages of the policy interest rate less the current annual CPI inflation rate, which we use as a proxy for the expected inflation rate.  The upper panel shows long- run real interest rates in each of the G -7 countries.  The lower panel shows the median long- run real interest rate across as many as 20 large economies for each year as well as the interquartile range and the U.S. long-run real interest rate.  Note that there are three subperiods of trends, with the long- run real interes t rate falling from the mid -1960s to the mid-1970s, then rising for 10 years or so, then falling again.

As everyone knows, we had a farewell lunch for President Kocherlakota at our October meeting, and Narayana recused himself from FOMC business after that .  I will also note that Ne el Kashkari has been selected as p resident of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis effective Jan uary 1, and he will be attending the January FOMC meeting. Attending on behalf of Minneapolis today is First Vice President Jim Lyon.  Jim has also represented Minneapolis at the FOMC in September 2009, and I know he has attended many FOMC meetings.  I would like to welcome you, Jim, back to the table. MR. LYON.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN. Let’s see.  Now, let me say , this entire meeting, as has been the case for a few meetings, will be a joint meeting of the FOMC and the Board of Governors.  So we need a motion to close the Board meeting. MR. FISCHER.  So moved. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Without objection.  L et’s ask Simon to start things off with the Desk report. MR. POTTER.1  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Since the Committee met in October, expectations that liftoff will occur at this meeting have increased substantially, while the expected slope of the target rate thereafter is little changed. As liftoff expectations grew earlier in the period, broader asset prices were relatively range bound. However, late in the period, sharp commodity price declines weighed on risk sentiment.  On net, domestic financial conditions tightened over the period. As shown in the top-left panel of your first exhibit, over the period the market-implied probability of liftoff at this meeting increased markedly, driven by the October FOMC statement and the better-than-expected October employment report . Adjusting for year- end effects in the January federal  funds futures contract, we estimate a market -implied probability of roughly 90 percent.  The average probability 1 The materials used by Mr. Potter and Ms. Logan are appended to this transcript (appendix 1).December 15–16, 20155 of 195of liftoff at this meeting , according to the Desk’s most recent dealer and buy -side surveys, is also around 90 percent.  And all but one of the 51 respondents view this meeting as the most likely tim e of liftoff. Amid  the buildup in expectations regarding liftoff, there was a parallel shift up in the market -implied policy rate path, as shown in the top-right panel.  The market -implied path continues to be shallow by historical standards at the initiation of tightening phases, rising by about 50 basis points per year in 2016 and 2017.  According to the Desk’s surveys, the average expected pace of tightening in the first two years after liftoff, conditional on not returning to the effective lower bound, declined slightly,  as shown in the middle-left panel, continuing the trend observed since we first asked about this in September 2014.  On average, survey respondents now expect the target rate to increase 80 basis points in the first year after liftoff and 95 basis points in the second year. Market rates over the next two years are still somewhat below the mean expectations of the target rate in  the Desk’s surveys, as shown in the middle-right panel.  These mean expectations are derived from survey questions eliciting probability distributions for year- end rates.  I mportantly , the answers include assessments of the likelihood of returning to the zero bound.  The dots in the panel show individual respondents’ expectations for the year-end target federal funds rate in 2016 and 2017, with the dots scaled by the proportion of respondents expecting each rate level and shaded by how likely they view a return to the effective lower bound; darker shades indicate a lower probability of returning to the effective  lower bound.  As you c an see, the gap between market rates (the red diamonds ) and the average survey expectations (the blue dashed lines ) is slight for 2016 but becomes larger in 2017, and respondents that place high weight on a return to the zero lower bound have lower mean rate expectations. The medians of the survey respondents’ modal expectations regarding the federal funds rate remain slightly below the median of the SEP dots published in September.  Desk survey respondents generally expect a decline in the median 2017 and 2018 dots and in the median projection of the longer- run rate at this meeting. In written commentary, they highlighted persistent downward pressures on global growth and recent Federal Reserve communications on the neutral federal funds rate as underpinning these expectations.  Thomas will discuss the path of policy and market expectations more in his briefing. Shifting to broader markets, expectations for liftoff to come at this meeting appeared to be taken largely in stride , particularly over the time period in early November during which these expectations increased to high levels.  In November, domestic equity price indices and credit spreads were relatively little changed , and, as shown in the bottom-left panel, option- implied volatility across asset classes remained subdued.  However, sharp declines in oil prices late in the intermeeting period appear to have had knock-on effects throughout global financial markets.December 15–16, 20156 of 195These declines in oil prices are shown in the bottom -right panel.  Over the period, the price of front-month Brent crude dropped by about 20 percent.  Broader commodity prices also declined notably over the period, with the Bloomberg Industrial Metals Index falling by roughly 10 percent.  While contacts largely attribute the decline in oil prices to persistent oversupply —especially following the most recent OPEC meeting —broad- based weakness in commodit y pric es likely in part reflects ongoing concerns about global growth. The commodity price declines had adverse effects on high-yield corpora te credit markets, as reflected in the widening in high-yield spreads shown in the top- left panel of your next exhibit.  The widening was most pronounced in energy credits (the dark blue line), with spreads, on average, up 200 basis points over the period.  However, there was also a more broad -based selloff, with high-yield spreads ex energy widening by 80 basis points.  As part of this, U.S. high-yield mutual funds and ETFs saw outflows of $4.5 billion for the week ending December 9, up from an average outflow of about $1 billion over the prior month.  And as was widely publicized last week, one open-ended high-yield mutual fund that had invested in lower-quality corporate bonds gated investors amid persistent redemption requests. Commodity price declines also continued to serve as a headwind to inflation compensation and emerging market asset prices. Five-year and five- year, five -year-forward inflation compensation was little changed on net and remains well below historical averages and the Federal Reserve ’s inflation objective, as shown in the top-right panel. Meanwhile, the JP  Morgan E merging Market Currency Index declined by 3 percent , and the MSCI Emerging Market Equity Index fell by over 10 percent.  The onshore and offshore renminbi depreciated against the U.S. dollar, as shown in the middle-left panel, taking the renminbi to levels weaker against the dollar than those seen following the devaluation in August.  Further, the basis between the onshore and offshore renminbi widened in recent weeks, as shown in grey in this panel, likely reflecting a reduced desire by Chinese officials to intervene in the wake of the announcement of the renminbi’s inclusion in the SDR basket and ahead of FOMC liftoff.  China’s leadership repeatedly stressed the strength of the renminbi on a trade-weighted basis, and many expect that in the future they will measure the renminbi against a basket of currencies rather than considering only the U.S dollar. More broadly, while dollar strength was most pronounced against commodity-linked currencies, the dollar appreciated modestly against the currencies of all major U.S. trading partners over the period, as shown in the dark blue lines in the middle -right panel.  The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index increased by about 1 percent, pushing year-to-date gains to nearly 8 percent. The ongoing theme of monetary policy divergence, particularly between the Federal Reserve and other major central banks , such as the ECB, continued to serve as a tailwind to U.S. dollar strength.  While on net the euro- to-dollar exchange rate was little changed on the period, the euro did touch its weakest level against the dollar"

I know that many of you have had to deal with pretty challenging travel conditions to get here, so I want to express my appreciation for your willingness to brave the snow and ice to participate in today’s meeting.   Before we get started , I want to discuss one housekeeping detail that  pertains to dinner this evening.  Normally, we would have a dinner after the FOMC meeting.  A nd it’s not impossible for us to do it tonight:  The Board s taff is prepared to provide  dinner.  However, almost all of the people who live in town here face quite challenging conditions in terms of getting home.  I t is also forecast  to rain this afternoon and maybe freeze over .  And so I am, frankly, concerned about people staying late and dealing with those conditions.   So would it be acceptable to people to make your own arrangements for dinner and cancel this evening?  PARTICIPANTS.  Yes.  CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Okay.  So we will consider dinner to be canceled. MR. WILLIAMS.  Will there be a sufficient supply of do ughnuts during the break?  [Laughter] CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, we gave you  a good lunch.  [Laughter]  MR. WILLIAMS.  Tomorrow morning, tomorrow morning. CHAIR YELLEN.  You should have confidence and trust your colleagues to do the best they possibly can on that score. Okay.  I mportantly, I would like to welcome Ne el Kashkari to his first FOMC meeting.

183,20160316,"Transcript of the Federal Open Market Committee Meeting on  March 15 –16, 2016 March 15 Session  CHAIR YELLEN.  Let’s begin.   Welcome, everybody.  As for  our past meetings, this entire meeting will be a joint meeting of the FOMC with the Board of Governors , and I need a motion to close the Board meeting. MR. FISCHER .  So moved. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Without objection.  O ur first order of business is “Financial Developments and Open M arket Operations,” and I’m going to ask Simon to start us off. MR. POTTER.1  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I will begin by discussing global financial market developments, and then Lorie will review money markets and operational matters.  Following their worst January since 2009, global risk asset prices continued to exhibit significant volatility over the intermeeting period.  The top-left panel of your first exhibit shows that the period can be divided in two.  In the first half, risk assets declined sharply, generally continuing the moves seen following the turn of the year.  However, since mid -February, risk asset prices have rebounded.  Taking a longer view :  On net, since the December FOMC  meeting , risk asset prices and advanced economy sovereign debt yields are lower, whil e the U.S. dollar is a bit weaker.  In order to gain greater insight into the price action s seen year -to-date, we asked respondents to the Desk’s surveys to rate the importance of various factors that may explain the recent financial market volatility.  As shown in the top-right panel, on average respondents assigned the highest ratings to three factors:  volatility in oil markets , Chinese FX developments, and changes to the outlook for foreign growth and inflation.  As I will discuss in more detail in the n ext three panels, a reduction in heightened concerns over these factors likely contributed to the retracement in risk asset prices since mid -February, although key sources of uncertainty underlying these factors have not been resolved, and this may suggest the rebound is tenuous.  Survey respondents also highlighted foreign central bank policy as a contributing factor, and, over the period, investors increasingly questioned the efficacy of monetary policy at the  lower bound in certain developed market economies.  I will discuss this later in 1 The materials used by Mr. Potter and Ms. Logan are appended to this transcript (appendix 1).  March 15–16, 20164 of 192my briefing.  Interestingly, only two respondents mentioned market psychology as an important factor, while one other pointed to reduced market liquidity. Beginning with oil, the middle -left panel shows that oil prices fell back to multi-decade lows in mid-February, and, amid ongoing negotiations between many producers to coordinate an output freeze, prices were volatile over the period, with an intraday trading range generally between 3 and 6 percent.  The wide daily swings in oil prices continued to have knock- on effects across global financial markets, and the correlation between changes in oil prices and a number of risk asset prices remained well above longer -run historical averages.  Although oil prices incre ased over the period to roughly $40 per barrel, they’re little changed year- to-date, and the outlook for them remains uncertain.  On the supply side, a coordinated output freeze is only speculative at this point, while the outlook for oil demand does not appear to have materially changed.  Against this backdrop, market participants continue to expect volatile trading conditions , and options on oil futures suggest price volatility will remain above its post- crisis average in the near term.  Moving to China, the stability in recent weeks in the renminbi −U.S. dollar fixing seems to have soothed market concerns.  Over the intermeeting period, the onshore renminbi was little changed against the U.S. dollar, broadly consistent with movements in th e basket of currencies that many Chinese policymakers describe as the new exchange rate peg.  That said, many investors perceive the recent stability as only temporary, in part because it has required high levels of intervention in foreign exchange markets.  The middle -right panel shows that Chinese foreign exchange reserves have declined by over $750 billion since the fall of 2014. Despite incremental communication in February from Chinese policymakers indicating an interest in renminbi stability against a  basket of exchange rates, many market participants are skeptical that this will be delivered , in light of prior abrupt adjustments to the exchange rate policy.  Market participants also point to the perceived pressure from capital outflows, the ongoing opacity concerning the exchange rate regime with respect to the U.S. dollar, and the viability of such a regime.  Investors still expect the renminbi to depreciate further against the U.S. dollar over the coming year, and options pricing indicates that the demand for protection against surprise renminbi depreciation is near post- crisis highs and well above levels prevailing prior to the August devaluation.  Beth Anne will discuss China and oil prices further in her briefing. While oil prices and the renminbi –U.S. dollar fixing have stabilized in recent weeks, concerns about longer-run global growth prospects or secular stagnation have not receded.  The bottom- left panel shows that five -year, five -year-forward  real yields in the U nited States  and euro area continued to decline over the intermeeting period.  The decline in real yields —alongside persistently low levels of forward inflation compensation—has resulted in a significant flattening in nominal sovereign yield curves, and nominal yields are at or near historic lows.  March 15–16, 20165 of 192At the intersection of these three factors, the financial sector has experienced heightened volatility and significant asset price declines since the start of the year.  The bottom-right panel shows that domestic and European bank stocks have been notable underperformers, as continued  net interest margin compression  due to flattening yield curves , energy-sector exposure, and idiosyncratic developments weighed on the sector.  Concerns over individual bank earnings and escalated doubts over the ability of certain banks to meet debt obligations exacerbated the steep slide in financial- sector stocks in the euro area, Japan , and the U nited States .  The share prices of some large banks were, at one point , 30 percent below the levels prevailing at the start of the year.  By contrast, some observers point to emerging markets , which have performed comparatively well so far this year, as an indication that financial market concerns have been overblown.  However, the relatively strong performance follows sharp declines across EM assets in the second half of 2015.  Further, as I highlighted with respect to China, most assume the current stability has been supported in part by active FX intervention and , therefore , question its sustainability over the medium -to-long term.  As volatility in global financial markets rose, expectations for more -accommodative monetary policies from developed- market central banks increased and have only partially retraced in recent weeks.  Year -to-date money market f utures rates across the euro area, Japan, and the U nited States  have all declined substantially. Further, going into the G-20 meeting in Shanghai, there was increased market chatter about the possibility of coordinated responses across central banks and fiscal authorities as many market participants focused on the international spillover effects and efficacy of monetary policy actions at the zero bo und. At the end of January, the Bank of Japan announced a negative interest rate policy to complement its ongoing asset purchase program, an unexpected change to its policy stance, as Japanese policymakers had previously been adamantly against using the to ol.  Despite the attempt to provide further accommodation and a short-lived positive response in financial markets, Japanese financial conditions tightened considerably in the weeks after the announcement.  The top-left panel of your next exhibit shows that the Japanese yen appreciated over 5 percent versus the U.S. dollar and Japan’s TOPIX Index declined 14 percent, on net, in the two weeks after the announcement.  Market participants link the moves in market prices in part to inconsistent policy communica tions, a complicated and unclear tiered system of interest rates on reserve balances, and more -fundamental questions about the efficacy of negative interest rate policy and the remaining capacity of B OJ policy tools to stoke inflation.  Indeed, in view of the size of the B OJ’s asset purchase program and the operational concerns associated with negative rates in Japan, the main tool remaining with ample capacity appears to be FX intervention.  In contrast, last week the ECB delivered a comprehensive and caref ully designed package of accommodative measures, which was generally viewed as surpassing consensus market expectations.  As detailed in the top-right panel, the ECB cut the March 15–16, 20166 of 192"

Today’s meeting will be a joint meeting of  the FOMC and the Board of Governors.  I need a motion to close the Board meeting. MR. FISCHER.  So moved. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Without objection. Our first agenda topic this morning is a special session on the relationship between monetary policy and financial stability.  I’d like to start off by thanking Mike Kile y and Egon Zakrajšek  of the Board ’s staff, Anna Paulson of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, and Geoff Tootell of  the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.  These individuals formed the steering committee that solicited contributions on this topic from across the S ystem and selected the four memos we received as background for today’s discussion.  I also, of course, want to thank the staff that produced and contributed to these background documents.  And so with that, let me turn things over to Jeff Fuhrer, who is going to begin the staff presentations. MR. FUHRER.1  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I want to begin w ith the traditional Federal Reserve greeting at events such as this, which is to say I will be referring  to the material in your packets labeled “The Linkages among Monetary Policy, Macroprudential Policy , and Financial Stability.” The topic that we will d iscuss during this session is sprawling, complex, widely discussed, tenaciously argued, and little understood.  Its aim is to help us avoid the kind of crisis we just went through.  That crisis begat massive unemployment and left in its wake longer -term da mage in the form of wealth loss and labor market scarring.  We certainly hope we can do better next time, but the question is, how? We begin by sketching the key features of financial instability on exhibit 2 of the handout.  The two main ingredients are rapid growth in debt and in asset prices, most often in the real estate sector.  The two can interact with one another in ways that are 1 The materials used by Messrs. Fuhrer, Adrian, and Sim are appended to this transcript (appendix 1).  April 26–27, 20164 of 261no doubt obvious to you by now:  Rising collateral valuations and debt issuance mutually reinforce one another.  But if the merry -go-round stops and prices drop, an all-too- familiar chain of events ensues:  Defaults rise, liquidity seizes, fire sales spread, prices fall further, solvency is threatened, and we lurch into a full-blown financial crisis, complete with a huge rec ession. It is unlikely that we will forever avoid the dynamics that have historically led to financial instability, no matter the regulatory environment and no matter who wins the presidential race .  Strong capital buffers and other structural tools will make the financial system more resilient in the face of disruptions, but they will likely not eliminate all financial instability and the potential for financial crises.  Thus, it is critical to think about how best to minimize the effects of financial disruptions on households and businesses using cyclical, time- varying tools to complement structural tools like capital ratios.   A key question is whether monetary policy should be one of these tools.  As emphasized in exhibit 3 in your packet, if macroprudential tools had already proven reliable and fully effective at curtailing financial instability, there would be little need to consider using monetary policy to address financial instability concerns. Other things being equal, it would be better not to charge monetary policy with additional goals beyond those specified in its dual mandate, but instead to allow macroprudential tools, if effective, to  address financial instability.  We briefly summarize research on the efficacy of cyclical macroprudential tools in the balance of this exhibit.  Developed economies have typically chosen not to use monetary policy to address financial stability concerns.  Instead, they have often used housing- related macroprudential tools —notably, loan- to-value , or LTV , and debt-service- to-income caps.  Mark Carey’s memo examines the effects of such policies in eight advanced foreign economies, or AFEs , and concludes that the effects on borrowing, while mixed, are somewhat hopeful.  Those countries that put in place LTV caps saw a decline in LTVs for newly originated loans—you sort of hope that at least that much happens.  Reductions in LTVs likely reduced losses to banks, improving somewhat the resilience of the system.  The effect of these caps on the trajectory  of hous e prices is less clear.  Exhibit 4 provides some history on LTV caps and house prices.  It displays house prices for four AFEs, indexed to 100 in 2010.  The vertical dashed lines indicate the dates of the implementation or reduction of LTV caps.  Spain and Singapore’s LTV caps began in 2000, at the far left side of the chart.  You can see that the imposition of LTV caps in these countries left little near -term imprint on the subsequent trajectory of housing prices.  In countries whose prices turned down, it was either four years later (as in Singapore, the black line) or in the wake of a wrenching financial crisis (as in Spain, the red line)—perhaps not exactly what was hoped for .  It may be that the limited effects of LTV caps to date reflect a too -timid app roach , for a s long as asset prices are expected to continue rising rapidly, the incentives to continue borrowing are strong. And the longer and higher prices rise, the greater is the risk of price April 26–27, 20165 of 261collapse.  This is why slowing price appreciation is a much -desired goal for macroprudential tools.  In view of current uncertainty about the efficacy of macroprudential tools, we consider whether monetary policy can and should be used to address episodes of emergent financial instability, the subject of your next exhibit.  To do so, policymakers must be able to detect unsustainable increases in debt and asset prices early enough to take preventative action.  They must also have confidence that monetary policy actions of moderate size can have sizable effects on deb t accumulation and asset price increases.  I would note that t hese two challenges are also faced by macroprudential policymakers.  With respect to the first hurdle, recent U.S. history is not encouraging, and neither is longer- term global history.   It is notoriously difficult to identify undesirable combinations of asset price and debt buildup early enough to take preventative action.  The recent experience of this Committee during the buildup to the financial crisis is sobering. The paper summarizes the results of a little trip down  memory lane via the transcripts of  FOMC meetings in 2005 and 2006.  I will not dwell further on painful memories.  With respect to the second hurdle, typical estimates of the elasticities linking the federal funds rate to , say, house prices or household debt appear to be relatively small.   This implies that only large movements in monetary instruments would have sizable effects on the evolution of these key variables.  And our confidence about policy’s effects is especially low during a credit boom or bubble period—how will bubbles respond to a change in fundamentals?  It’s hard to know.  Whether monetary policy should address financial instability depends in part on how much such actions are estimated to reduce the probability of a crisis and its severity , should it occur.  But these benefits must be balanced against the potential for monetary policy to inflict collateral damage on the rest of the economy while seeking to mitigate financial instability.  As indicated at  the bottom of this exhibit, employing a conventional model, Lars Svensson finds that in almost no case does a monetary policy that leans against the winds of financial instability do more good than harm.  We need more research to assess these tradeoffs, but what we know today suggests we might want to tread lightly in using monetary policy to lean against the winds of financial instability.  As discussed in exhibit 6, because both monetary policy and at least some macroprudential tools are likely to remain in the too lkit for U.S. policymakers, we need to consider the interactions between the two sets of tools and their policymaking bodies.  Arguably, the longer -run goals of both policies coincide, although the short-run goals differ, and, of course, the tools differ.  It is clear that monetary policymakers at the least need to take into account the effects that macroprudential policies might have on employment and inflation.  Similarly, macroprudential policymakers need to take into account the effect that interest rate policy may have on risk-taking, borrowing, and asset price appreciation.

185,20160615,"Transcript of the Federal Open Market Committee Meeting on  June 14 –15, 2016  June 14 Session  CHAIR YELLEN.  Good afternoon, everybody.  As usual, today’s meeting will be in its entirety a joint meeting of the FOMC and the Board of Governors.  So I need a motion to close the Board meeting. MR. FISCHER.  So moved. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  As I think almost everyone here knows, Tom Baxter will retire from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in Se ptember.  This was to be the last FOMC meeting that he attended, but he recently decided that his to -do list was sufficiently lengthy that, in order to actually retire as planned, he would need to stay in New York to work rather than attend today’s meeting . I think it is entirely appropriate , though, that we recognize him in absentia.  Tom’s well -deserved retirement will follow 36 years of service to the New York Bank , at which  he has served as g eneral counsel since 1995.  Tom also has been deputy general counsel of the FOMC the past two decades, attending 106 regularly scheduled Committee meetings.  Tom’s contributions to the work of the Federal Reserve were especially crucial during the recent financial crisis when the Federal Reserve needed to design and implement a broad range of effective lending programs to help support the financial system and the economy, in many cases in a matter of days, if not hours.  Tom was at the center of many of those efforts.  We appreciate all that Tom has done for the Feder al Reserve, for the New York District, and for the country, and I’m sure that I speak for all of us in wishing him the best in retirement.   And I believe Vice Chair man Dudley would also like to make some remarks about Tom. June 14–15, 20164 of 201VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.   Well, my v iews are very much the same as yours, Madam Chair.  I think Tom played a key role in the S ystem  throughout his long career.  He will especially be remembered for his leadership at the time of the 9/11 attack and during the financial crisis, figuring out with Scott Alvarez and many others exactly what we legally could do to save the financial system from collapse, and that was not an easy task.  Also,  of course, I appreciate the support he has given me during my tenure.  You know, 21 years as general counsel meant that he was serving under three different New York Federal Reserve presidents, and in some ways he’s tracked your own career at the Federal Reserve, Madam Chair, basically being the deputy counsel to the FOMC when you were Governor, when you were president of the San Francisco Fed, Vice Chair , and now the Chair.  I imagine that he’s pretty high up in the hierarchy of attending meetings at the Fed —probably not quite in “Don Kohn” territory [laughter], but maybe in the top 10 or 20. I wish he could be here today, but I think it’s important to acknowledge his contributions and wish him all the success in whatever comes his way after his retirement .  And it’s not really a retirement.  It’s a retirement from the Federal Reserve.  The idea that Tom would actually retire  [laughter], that’s just not going to happen.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Next , I wanted to provide you with a brief update on the long- run framework project.  As T homas  and Simon noted in their March 7 memo to the Committee, the analysis is being conducted by five main work groups.  The first three so- called foundational groups are focusing on lessons from the crisis, the foreign experience, and money markets.  These groups have conducted workshops with academics, market experts, and central bankers, and their work has been presented and reviewed in S ystemwide  plenary sessions that have been well attended and very productive.  In addition to these foundational groups, two June 14–15, 20165 of 201framework groups are conducting analysis, one focused on interest rate targets and operating regimes and another on a range of issues associated with the size and composition of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet.   These framework groups have also held workshops with a range of experts from inside and outside the System . Now, we anticipate that the work of the three foundational groups will be presented to the FOMC at the July meeting and that of the two framework groups at the November meeting.  As background for the July presentation, you will receive summary memos from each of the three foundational work groups early next month, and the r esearch directors  will receive several background memos later this  month.  At the meeting, staff presentations will review the material provided in the memos, and we will reserve ample time for FOMC participants to ask questions and to offer their views on the key issues raised by the memos and staff presentations.  Now,  at this time , does anyone have questions or comments about these plans?  [No response] Okay.  The next item, before we turn to our regular agenda items , is that  I wanted to update you on our meeting schedule for next year.  As you know, a draft meeting ca lendar for 2017 was circulated to the Committee earlier this month, and we received no objections from participants.  We had planned to publish the calendar this Friday.  Unfortunately, we just learned that a newly scheduled international meeting and its p otential knock- on effects on the scheduling of other international meetings will raise a question about the workability of part of the proposed FOMC schedule.  And we are now looking into those complications. Depending on the outcome, we may be able to move ahead with the currently proposed FOMC schedule possibly as soon as this Friday , or, conceivably, we may need to change the date of the March meeting , potentially by moving it either a week earlier or a day later .  And we will get back to you as soon as we possibly can if that proves necessary.   Meanwhile, we want to ask June 14–15, 20166 of 201"

We are all a couple of minutes early, but it looks like we’ re ready to get going.  Today’s meeting, as usual, will be a joint meeting between the FOMC and the Board of Governors.  So I need a motion to close the Board meeting. MR. FIS CHER.  So moved. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Okay.  We’re going to begin with our first topic, “L ong-Run F ramework for Monetary P olicy I mplementation ,” and let me ask Simon to start us off on this. MR. POTTER.1  Thank you, Madam Chair.  We will be referring to the materials titled “Long-Run Framework for Monetary Policy Implementation.”   The briefing today summarizes the work of three foundational workgroups on the foreign experience, lessons from the crisis, and money markets that was distributed to the C ommittee over the past few weeks.   As you know, this is a System -wide effort with important contributions from a number of d ivisions of the Board and all of the Reserve Banks.   Today, in addition to the presenters at the table—Brian Doyle, David Altig, and Beth Klee—we have Patricia Zobel, Ed Nosal, and Susan McLaughlin seated behind us, who were the co -leads for these presenters.  They’ll also be available to answer questions.  In slide 3 of your rather thick  presentation package, you can see the key goals of the project that were agreed to almost one year ago.  These goals have obviously been influenced by the experience of advanced- economy central banks over the past 10 years or so.  The foundational workgroups were designed to put this experience into a structure that will feed into the two framework workgroups , which are focused on interest rate targets , operating regimes, and the balance sheet.  Our current plan is for the framework  workgroups to present their findings at the November meeting.  The feedback that you will provide today and in November will inform the staff ’s work on evaluat ing comprehensive frameworks that will be presented to the Committee further down the road.  The next slide shows an additional set of objectives for alternative operating frameworks.  Objective 2 on promoting efficient, effective , and resilient money  1 The materials used by Messrs. Potter, Doyle, and Altig and Mses. Klee and Remache are appended to this transcript (appendix 1).  July 26–27, 20164 of 283markets will be an important focus of the presentation today.  As also noted on this slide, the C ommittee’s normalization principles and plans provide an additional set of criteria when it comes to the size and composition of the SOMA portfolio.  Brian will now present on the foreign experience.  MR. DOYLE.  Thank you, Simon.  To start our presentations, I ’m going to talk about monetary policy implementation elsewhere in the world.  The foreign experience workgroup, co-led by Patricia Zobel of the Federal Reserve Bank of  New York, primarily surveyed the experience of nine advanced-economy central banks.  As noted on slide 6, this survey included how central banks implemented policy before the crisis, how the frameworks evolved since then, and some of the rationale for those frameworks.  In my limited time, I will just touch on some of the highlights from the memorandum that was circulated earlier . As shown in your next slide, there is one finding that is perhaps useful to state right off  the bat.  We don’ t see dramatic differences in most central banks’ ability to control short- term money market rates or to transmit effects of monetary policy out to longer- term interest rates.  However, the wide variety of frameworks represents choices that central banks have made regarding  how to achieve that control.  And a better understanding of these choices may be helpful, as they reflect decisions that these central banks made regarding tradeoffs along other dimensions. What are the primary differences in these frameworks?  First, as noted in the first row of the table in slide 8, before the crisis, nearly all advanced -economy central banks communicated monetary policy with an overnight interest rate.  But what that rate was varied some.  A few central banks, like the Federal Reserve, used a target for a market rate.  M any others used an administered rate— that is, a rate pertaining to  some operation that they themselves set.  Even in these latter cases, central banks often  made reference to a market rate.  The m arket rates were usually unsecured rates.  Inn a couple of cases, however, they were secured rates.  As shown in your next slide, how central banks controlled money market rates also varied.  Before  the crisis, most u sed “corridor” regimes, supplying reserves to meet banks’ demand at the policy rate and generally using lending and deposit facilities to create a ceiling and a floor.  Within this group , most central banks had some form of reserve requirements to foster a  stable demand for reserves.  A few central banks used “floor” regimes, providing sufficient liquidity for market rates to trade near the rate of interest that the central bank pays on deposits or reserves.  After the crisis began, how central banks impleme nted policy shifted.  Unconventional policies, including large- scale asset programs  not only of government, but in some cases private -sector assets; long-term funding programs, such as those of the ECB; and, most recently , negative interest rates, in some cases became the primary means of implementing  and communicating  policy.  And, as indicated by the arrows in the chart, as central banks injected more liquidity under some of these programs, corridor systems in many instances became de facto floor systems.  July 26–27, 20165 of 283As shown on the next slide, the distinctions between corridor and floor regimes have become blurred a little in recent years, as central banks changed how they remunerate reserves and gave banks a wider degree of choice over how many reserves to hold.  To  encourage interbank trading and reduce banks’ hoarding of reserves, central banks using floors began to pay a lower rate on reserves above some threshold or quota —“tiered remuneration .”  This “tiering” is also similar to what has been seen more recently w ith negative policy rates at the Swiss National Bank and the Bank of Japan, albeit for a very different reason —that is, to limit the costs for banks of holding reserves.  And, before the crisis, the Bank of England implemented a corridor regime in which banks could choose their own target for reserves—a “voluntary reserves target”—reducing some of the costs associated with reserve requirements.  These regimes influence the nature of activity in money markets, as highlighted on the next slide.  Systems characterized by  scarce excess reserves generally feature  robust interbank trading.  In floor systems that featured  quotas, in conditions of still -abundant reserves, money market trading is largely between banks that are above their quotas and banks that are below.  Likewise, currently in Japan and the United Kingdom, money market trading is largely between nonbank participants without access to remunerated accounts and banks with access.  In these economies, as shown in the figure, money market rates trade  below the rate on reserves, as is the case in the United States (the red line).  Some central banks view arbitrage activity created by remuneration systems as meaningful and robust, while others view activity created by reserve scarcity as providing more insight into money market conditions. Turning the page, another observation from the foreign experience is that central banks have added counterparties and accepted a wider range of collateral during the crisis (or already had broad sets of both) and expect to keep those broader sets.  For some central banks, th is broadening of counterparties has included nonbank entities, including financial market utilities.  The main reason for the expansion during the crisis was a desire to provide liquidity to parts of the financial system that were “cut off.”  But some foreign central banks also see advantages in reducing competitive distortions created by conferring counterparty status on a narrow group and in the enhanced information that they  receive about interacting with a number of institutions.  That said, central banks acknowledge that broader policy comes with costs—increased operational costs, the potential to reduce private market activity —and that a ccepting a wider set of collateral could create some moral h azard if it encourages banks to hold riskier assets. The next slide, slide 13, notes that a few central banks see liquidity insurance—the readiness to provide broad-based liquidity in the case of a shock—as distinct from either monetary policy implementati on or emergency lending and have different operations to meet those separate objectives.  The Bank of England views liquidity insurance as operations with clear criteria for use and broad access, and its scheme allows financial institutions to obtain reserves or liquid assets for less liquid assets.  They view the  clarity about the purpose of these operations as, it is hoped, reducing stigma and clarity about when these facilities would be used as limiting contagion July 26–27, 20166 of 283"

Let’s get under way.  Today’s meeting, as usual, will be a joint meeting of the FOMC and the Board of Governors, so I need a motion to close the Board meeting. MR. FISCHER.  So moved. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Without objection.  O ur first agenda item is the selection of a Committee officer.  As many of you know, Michael Held, who is seated near the anter oom door, has been appointed gene ral counsel and e xecutive vice president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  I am pleased to recommend that the Committee select Michael as its deputy general counsel .  Consistent with the Committee’s standard practice for appointment of its officers, this selection would be effective until the Committee’s first regularly scheduled meeting in 2017.  Michael has been with the New York Federal Reserve for the past 18 years and is a highly experienced central banking attorney.  Vice Chair man, would you l ike to make a comment? VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. Yes.  F irst, I’d like to second the notion of him becoming the deputy general counsel for the FOMC.  He has big shoes to fill with Tom Baxter retiring from the New York Fed, but I’m sure he will do so very ably .  I’ve worked with him for many years, and I very much trust his knowledge and his judgment.  I t’s nice to have him here at the FOMC on a more permanent basis, taking a seat next to Scott, who ’s not here today, but — [laughter]— we will be seeing Michael there on a regular basis.  I’m very pleased.  Thank you.September 20–21, 20165 of 216CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Any discussion or any objections?  Okay.  Seeing none, the selection is approved unanimously by the Committee.  And congratulations, Michael, we are looking forward to working with you in your new role. That takes us to the second agenda item, which concerns proposed revisions of the documents governing foreign currency operations.  As you know, the staff has been engaged in a long-term effort to develop proposed revisions to the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations, the Foreign Currency D irective , and other related documents. You all received memos on the proposal from the staff in mid -August, and last week we sent a short additional memo from the Foreign Currency S ubcommittee. This project has required a lot of careful analysis involving staff from both the New York Federal Reserve and the Board.  That work was carried out under the general oversight of the Subcommittee , and I’d like to thank the staff for what seems to me to be an excellent proposal. In my view, it meets the important objectives of the project. I might note that the proposal provides that the Subcommittee, in consultation with the Committee, may give additional instructions to the Desk re garding holdings of foreign currencies. As I mentioned, the S ubcommittee recently sent the Committee a short memo, which included draft instructions that the Subcommittee would plan to issue to the Desk.  U nless there are objections, the Subcommittee woul d issue these instructions within a few days following this meeting.  The Committee will not be asked to vote on those instructions.  Let me now turn to Simon, who’s going to summarize the proposal. MR. POTTER.1  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I’d just like to say that s ome of the staff involved in the project are in the room today , including Paul Dozier and Mike Leahy from IF ; Cindy Hull from the Desk; and Sophia Allison, who is sitting next to Lorie , from the Board ’s Legal  Division. 1 The materials used by Mr. Potter are appended to this transcript (appendix 1).September 20–21, 20166 of 216I’ll be discussing important changes to the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations (the Authorization), the Foreign Currency Directive (the Directive), and the Procedural Instructions with Respect to Foreign Currency Operations. As discussed in the memo the Committee received in August titled “Proposed Revisions to Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations and Related Organizational Documents, ” the revisions are intended to meet three objectives: first, reflect the current operating environment; second, clarify guidance to the Selected Bank by updating governance for each operation; and, third, simplify the structure of the documents. Proposed changes to the document structure are summarized in the top- left panel of your exhibit.  The proposed documents are organized to consolidate authorizations and directions into the Authorization and the Directive, respectively, and to clarify governance and guidance relating to specific operation types.  All text authorizing an operation and any language regarding its purpose is in the Authorization, while specific direction to the Selected Bank to conduct each operation is in the Directive. In both documents, text for each operation type is grouped together, in contrast to the format of the current documents.  Also , the existing Procedural Instructions are eliminated, as language from the document is incorporated into the Authorization and Directive.  This proposed two-document organization structure now aligns with the one used for domestic operations.  The s taff a lso proposes to move both the definition and governance of the Foreign Currency S ubcommittee, currently in the Authorization, into the Rules of Organization and Rules of Procedure, respectively. The s taff also proposes several substantive changes to foreig n currency operation procedures and governance.  These changes are designed to reflect the current operating environment and to clarify guidance to the Selected Bank.  These changes remove the discretion that the Selected Bank has in the existing governanc e framework to determine whether to execute foreign currency operations and how to set parameters for investing the foreign currency holdings.  The proposed framework now authorizes the Foreign Currency S ubcommittee to both determine whether to execute int erventions within specified limits and provide additional instructions regarding the management of the foreign reserves. The s taff proposes assigning these responsibilities to the Foreign Currency S ubcommittee primarily to accommodate the often time-sensitive nature of decisions that must be made regarding implementation of intervention operations as well as to facilitate coordination with the U.S. Treasury or foreign central banks. The proposed documents are organized into five operation types: interventions, warehousing, reciprocal currency arrangements, U.S. dollar and foreign liquidity swaps, and foreign currency holdings.  I will now address major changes made to the documents according to each of these operation types.  Additional proposed changes are listed in the appendix of your exhibit. The top-right panel of your exhibit lists major changes to foreign exchange intervention operations. The proposed documents remove the Selected Bank’s discr etion to determine whether to execute as much as $600 million in intervention"
188,20161102,"November 1–2, 20164 of 258Transcript of the Federal Open Market Committee Meeting on November 1 –2, 2016 November 1 Session CHAIR YELLEN.  Good morning, everybody.  As usual, this meeting will be a joint meeting of the FOMC and the Board of Governors.  I need a motion to close the Board meeting. MR. FISCHER.  So moved. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Without objection.  And, as many of you know, Nellie Liang and Mike Leahy have announced that they will be retiring, and this will be their last FOMC meeting.  Nellie began her career at the Board in 1986 when she joined the Division of Research and Statistics as an economist, and she worked on a variety of financial issues over the course of her career.  Nellie was a key participant in crafting the Federal Reser ve’s response to the financial crisis.  She helped lead a number of crisis-era programs, including the 2009 Supervisory Capital Assessment Program, or b ank s tress t ests, which played an important role in increasing public confidence in the banking system and set the template for our ongoing C CAR program.  In 2010, she was appointed founding director of the newly created Office of Financial Stability Policy and Research, which went so well that it is now the Division of Financial Stability.  As director, she led the effort to establish our new financial stability monitoring and policy framework.   Nellie started attending FOMC meetings in 2005 and has attended a total of 53 meetings. Mike first joined the Board as a research assistant in the Divisi on of International Finance on a break from his Ph.D. work.  After returning to graduate school and completing his studies, he rejoined IF and then rose steadily through the ranks, becoming deputy director in 2012. Along the way, Mike made innumerable contributions to the work of the division, the Board, andNovember 1–2, 20165 of 258the FOMC as one of our leading experts on exchange rates and monetary policy.  Including today’s meeting, Mike has attended 55 FOMC meetings since his first meeting in 2004. Nellie and Mike, we are all truly grateful for everything that you have done for the Federal Reserve, and we wish you the best in your well-deserved retirements.  [Applause] Before turning to the first agenda item, I would like to recognize Governor Fischer as chairman of the commun ications s ubcommittee. MR. FISCHER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I would like to provide some advance notice on changes to the policy on external communications that the subcommittee on communications will be proposing when we conduct our annual review of FOMC organizational documents in January.  In particular, we would like to align the start of the blackout period more closely with the start of our serious discussion of the monetary policy alternatives. Under our current practice, Committee participants rec eive the first draft of the alternative policy statements on the Friday 11 days before the beginning of the FOMC meeting.  That is assuming the usual Tuesday –Wednesday meeting schedule.  But our blackout period on external communication s commences at midni ght eastern time 7 days before the beginning of the meeting.  The circulation of the draft policy statements marks the start of our deliberative process for the coming FOMC decision, a process that the blackout period is intended to foster and to protect.  That means that we currently face a gap between the time our deliberations begin and the start of the blackout period .  And we are investigating ways to close this gap.  In the meantime, I urge all of us to be very careful in our public communications—whi ch I’m sure we all are most of the time —particularly during the time period in question. In addition to this modification, in January we will also be suggesting some clarifications of the blackout policy, particularly as it relates to the staff and their p ossible participation inNovember 1–2, 20166 of 258conferences and during the blackout period. The subcommittee will circulate a memo describing all proposed changes sometime before the December meeting.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Any questions or comments for Governor Fischer?  Okay.  Then let’s turn to the first item on our agenda, which is “Long-Run Framework for M onetary Policy Implementation .”  Troy Davig is going to start off our presentations. MR. DAVIG.1  Thank you Madam Chair.  We will be referring to the materials titled “Material for Briefing on Long-Run Monetary Policy Implementation Framework. ”  The briefings today summarize the work of the latest phase of the long-run framework project. As you are aware, this has been a Systemwide project featuring contributions from the Board and all Reserve Banks.  In addition to the presenters at the table, there were several additional coauthors on the main memos, including Ron Feldman, who is also present and available to answer questions. Following on the founda tional work presented at the July meeting, which covered money markets, foreign experiences, and lessons from the crisis, this phase of the project focused on issues related to possible policy rate targets  and operating regimes as well as considerations regarding the balance sheet.  In general, the combination of these elements comprise s the key aspects of an operating “framework.” The scope of this project was outlined now over one year ago, with three broad objectives listed on page 3 of your briefing packet.  The first project objective was that any framework needs to achieve an appropriate degree of short- term interest rate control, including in periods of financial dis tress and in a manner robust to structural changes in the financial system.  As the briefing s by Jane Ihrig and Antoine Martin will highlight, this ob jective can be achieved using different policy rates and with a range of operating frameworks, which could vary in the use of ceiling and floor facilities, the level of reserves, and the breadth of counterparties. The second objective was that a framework should enhance the ability to achieve macroeconomic and financial -stability objectives at the effective lower  bound.  Here the work reveals that the ability to effectively respond to the effective lower  bound does not create sharp distinctions across operating regimes, though some operating regimes would require adjustm ents at the lower bound.  In addition, maintaining operational readiness is important, particularly if the Committee intends to possibly use asset purchases or other tools that are not used routinely as part of the day -to-day operational framework .  In ter ms of balance sheet policy, Deborah Leonard and David López- Salido will discuss how the balance sheet can be used to support interest rate control as well as macroeconomic goals and financial stability. 1 The materials used by Mr. Davig, Ms. Ihrig, Mr. Martin, Mr. López -Salido, Ms. Leonard, and Mr. Laubach are appended to this transcript (appendix 1)."

Today and tomorrow’s meeting is a joint meeting of the FOMC and the Board of Governors.  I need a motion to close the Board meeting. MR. FISCHER.  So moved. CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay.  T hank you.  Without objection.  I think most of you know that President Lockhart has announced that he plans to step down from his position early next year, and this will be his last FOMC meeting. Dennis has agreed to come back for a reception in January on the evening of the first day of the FOMC meeting, which will provide us with an opportunity to honor him appropriately and express our best wishes in a more festive setting than an FOMC meeting. But I’d also like to make just a few remarks today.  After a long and varied career in finance and academia here and abroad, Dennis joined the Federal Reserve in March 2007 as President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta.  That was just months before t he Global Financial C risis.   Fortunately, we all know that correlation is not causation.  [Laughter] For the past decade, President Lockhart has ably represented the Federal Reserve in the Six th District. He has contributed greatly to the System’s work generally, including serving most recently as chairman of the Conference of Presidents.  And , in the course of attending 79 FOMC meetings, he has enhanced the Committee’s deliberations on monetary policy through his careful reporting on economic and financi al developments in the Atlanta District, his thoughtful analysis of national conditions and the economic outlook, and his balanced approach to our policy decisions.December 13–14, 20165 of 184Dennis, we thank you for your service to the Federal Reserve, and we wish you all the best in the next phase of your career. MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  [Applause] CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay.  Let us turn to our agenda.  T he first item pertains to “Proposed Revisions to R ules Regarding A vailability of Information. ”  You recently received a staff memorandum that proposes certain revisions to the Committee’s rules regarding the availability of information.  To summarize briefly, legislation passed earlier this year requires federal agencies to implement a number of changes to relevant information availability policies by December 27. Approval of the staff proposal would align the Committee’s FOIA rules with the new statutory requirements and would implement a number of additional changes, all of which are technical. Let me ask: Does anybody have any questions for the staff about the proposals? [No response]  Okay.  If not, I suggest that we now have a single vote on the proposal, and I’m going to ask Brian to explain exactly what it is that we will be requested to vote  on. MR. MADIGAN.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  This vote will encompass three sets of items.  For your reference, I might note that these items are included on page 2 of the staff memorandum under the heading “Procedural Notes.”  First, the Committee would approve the adoption of the recommended changes to its rules regarding the availability of information.  A tracked -changes version of the rules is attached to the staff memo.   Second, the Committee would make two determinations that would allow the revised rules to be published in the Federal Register as an immediately effective interim final rule under the Administrative Procedure Act. One, the Committee would determine that there is good cause that public notice and comment on these amendments would be “impracticable, unnecessary , or contrary to the public interest.”December 13–14, 20166 of 184Two, the Committee would determine that there is good cause to waive the typical 30-day delay for the effective date of the rule. The staff believes that these determinations are reasonable because, one, the a ct requires agencies to implement the necessary changes to the rules in a very short time frame , and, two, the changes beyond those required by the a ct are technical in nature. Third, the Committee would authorize the Secretary in consultation with the General Counsel to do two things:  one, to take the appropriate steps to reflect these changes in the rules and records of the Committee and submit the appropriate filings to the Federal Register, and, two, to appoint a Federal Reserve e mployee as the Committee’s FOIA public liaison to fulfill the roles described in the amended rules. A draft of the Federal Register notice, which includes a detailed description of the changes, was attached as appendix 2 to the staff memo. That notice is the proposal on which the Committee is being asked to vote. CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay.  Do I have a motion to approve the proposal? MR. FISCHER.  So moved. CHAIR YELLEN.  And a second? VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Second. CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay.  Without objection.  Okay , Brian . MR. MADIGAN.  Thank you very much.  I just have an additional note.  Although the interim final rule will be effective immediately upon publication in the Federal Register, the public will have 60 days to submit any comments.  The staff anticipate s that after the public comment period, the Committee will be asked , potentially at the March meeting , to make the rule final either as is or with changes, if warranted by public comment, and to authorize publication of the final rule in the Federal Register.  Thank you."

I call this meeting to order.  Thanks to everyone for braving the elements to be here.  This will be a joint Board meeting and FOMC meeting.  As usual, I need a motion to close the Board meeting. MR. FISCHER.  So moved. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  And without objection.  It is my unhappy duty to open today’s meeting by noting, as all of you know, that this will be Governor Tarullo’s las t FOMC meeting.  Dan was appointed and confirmed as a member of the Board of Governors in January 2009, a time of tremendous upheaval in the global economy.  The events that have transpired over Dan’s eight-year tenure rank as truly astounding, and just as astounding has been the pivotal role that Dan has played in shaping those events. Dan, your accomplishments are far too extensive to enumerate here.  Importantly, you are widely regarded as the leader of the Fed’s comprehensive efforts to strengthen finan cial regulation and supervision, and you have been tremendously successful on that score.  But because this is a meeting of the FOMC, let me remark more directly on your contributions as a monetary policymaker, which are no less impressive. Three things stand out for me.  First, your contributions reflect outstanding economic and policy analysis.  Our deliberations have been greatly enhanced by your coherent perspectives and well-crafted arguments.  I would especially highlight your discussions of labor market developments. Second, your approach to policy analysis has been, let me say, “ refreshingly skeptical ” of many of the conventional tales told by economists.  Perhaps this is partly an advantage thatMarch 14–15, 20175 of 252reflects your legal training.  Before simply accepting  that monetary policy or the economy works in the ways that economists conventionally assume and incorporate in their models, you often want to see the evidence.  The ability to challenge conventional wisdom is always valuable, but it’s been particularly i mportant in the aftermath of the crisis. And, finally, you have contributed importantly to this Committee’s deliberations by listening —listening carefully to your colleagues, questioning them on unclear points or on evidence for their claims, and resisting sometimes vague compromises  proposed for the sake of consensus in Committee communications or actions.  While that trait may have caused a bit of consternation from time to time, it has made all of us think harder, consider different options, improve our arguments, and ultimately make better policy. Suffice it to say , Dan, you are leaving the place in better shape than you found it.  The economy, the financial system, and the Federal Reserve are all stronger because of your leadership and dedication to our mission.  On a personal note, I want to thank you sincerely for your work here and say how much I ’ve appreciated your friendship and the opportunity to collaborate. On behalf of everyone in this room, let me wish you all the best. Now I ’d like to turn the floor over to Eric, who would also like to say a few words. MR. ROSENGREN.  Just a very brief remark .  First, as a lawyer around the table, you’ve been in the minority, but I think that we’ve seen quite a value to having somebody who has a legal background.  During those times when we have agreed, I’ve loved your comments.  [Laughter] During those times when we didn’t, I have respected your comments.  And I would just like to conclude by saying that you’ve played a really significant role  in supervision.  That’s not part of the FOMC, but getting supervision right is critically important for also getting theMarch 14–15, 20176 of 252macroeconomy right, and I think all the presidents  who have had interactions with you have appreciated the changes that you ’ve made.  So thank you very much. CHAIR YELLEN.  First Vice President Jim Lyon has also announced his retirement. And I would just like to say that he ’s attending today’s meeting, and I ’ll take this opportunity to make a few remarks to honor his service. At the Boa rd and at each Reserve Bank, typically there are a handful of experienced and skilled staff members who are indispensable, and Jim has surely been one of them at the Minneapolis Fed.  Rarer still are the individuals who serve in that role at their own institutions and also contribute to important Systemwide initiatives , which is so vital to the effective operation of the Fed, with its decentralized structure.  Jim has been that rare person — indispensable at both the Minneapolis Bank  and in the S ystem .   Jim, you represent the very best of the Fed.  It ’s been an honor and a pleasure to serve with you.  Thank you for 40 years of dedicated service, and all the best for a long and happy retirement. And I understand that President Kashkari would like to — MR. KASH KARI.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Just to add to your comments about Jim, he has served almost 41 years at the Minneapolis Fed .  To put that in perspective, that is almost 40 percent of the history of the Federal Reserve.  And to also put that in perspective, I was two years old when he joined the Minneapolis Fed.  [Laughter] During his storied career , he’s had a wide range of responsibilities.  When he first joined the Minneapolis Fed in the Law Department, he made a contribution right away, but then, at the age of 29, he was recognized and became a senior aide to then -President Jerry Corrigan.  He ’s had a variety of responsibilities at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis—overseeing bank"
192,20170503,"May 2–3, 20174 of 207Transcript of the Federal Open Market Committee Meeting on May 2–3, 2017 May 2 Session CHAIR YELLEN.  Good afternoon, everybody.  As usual, our proceedings today will be a joint meeting of the FOMC and the Board of Governors.  I need a motion to close the Board meeting. MR. FISCHER.  So moved. CHAIR YELLEN.  And without objection.  I would l ike to note that First Vice President Mark Mullin ix is representing the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond at today’s meeting, and we anticipate that he will do  so until a new president of that Reserve Bank has been selected and is in office. Mark has atten ded a number of FOMC meetings previously.  Mark, we welcome you to the FOMC table. Also, I’m pleased to note that First Vice President Gooding is again representing the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. Raphael Bostic is scheduled to assume office as p resident on June 5, and we look forward to working with him soon.  Marie, thank you for your contributions to the Committee’s deliberations in the interim. We appreciate it. And now let’s turn to our first agenda item, which is “Financial Developments and Open Market Operations.” Simon will start us off. MR. POTTER.1  Thank you, Madam Chair.  As shown in the top- left panel of your first exhibit, nominal Treasury yields declined and the dollar depreciated over the intermeeting period, partially reversing price action seen since the November FOMC.  An important factor behind the moves appears to be increasing investor skepticism about the Trump Administration’s ability to push through many of its pro-growth initiatives. Geopolitical tensions, weaker -than-expected U.S. data, and Federal Reserve communications also contributed to the declines in yi elds and the dollar.  Meanwhile, equity valuations and emerging- market asset prices have been quite resilient, and risk assets were given a boost following the result of the first round of the French presidential election and, to a lesser extent, an ongoing 1 The materials used by Mr. Potter are appended to this transcript (appendix 1).May 2–3, 20175 of 207improvement in foreign economic data.  Against this backdrop, no increase in the target range is expected at this meeting , and the market -implied path of the policy rate flattened over the intermeeting period. The failure to make progress on the proposed American Health Care Act led many market participants to call into question the Administration’s ability to accomplish its broader initiatives, including tax reform and infrastructure spending. That said, respondents to our surveys still expect an expans ionary fiscal policy of some form to be implemented.  As shown in the top-right panel, respondents’ estimates of the fiscal deficit over the next few years remain much higher since the election. Market participants continue to debate whether the election’s positive effect on business and household confidence will improve the trajectory of the economy.  The middle- left panel shows that the difference between “soft” and “hard” domestic data surprises is as wide as it has been since the turn of the century.  A t the same time, measures of economic policy uncertainty remain at very high levels, and some market participants are switching their focus from the positive effects of animal spirits to the negative effect  of persistent policy uncertainty on business and household decisions. While some of the post -election political momentum in the United States appears to be waning, the outcome of the first round of the French presidential election was viewed as stabilizing political risk in the region. Mr. Macron, a pro-EU centrist, and Ms. Le Pen, a Euroskeptic, moved on to the second round, averting a runoff between two Euroskeptic candidates. The middle-right panel shows that the relative cost of protection against euro depreciation vis-à- vis the dollar reached euro -crisis levels just ahead of the first -round election, but it quickly returned to its multiyear average after the first-round results were announced. The bottom- left panel shows that spreads of French and peripheral sovereign debt yields to German equivalents also widened considerably ahead of the first-round election, though spreads have also normalized. The final round of the election is this Sunday, and betting markets imply a very high probability of Mr. Macron winning the presidency.  These odds are consistent with recent polls showing that his lead is well outside the margin of error, which appears to be giving investors comfort.  In both euro currency options and French sovereign debt markets, there appear to be very little risk premiums still priced in, suggesting investors may not be well positioned for a surprising outcome this weekend. Even beyond the French election, political risks that could undermine EU political unity remain.  German elections are scheduled for the fall, and Italian elections, while not yet scheduled, need to occur before May 20, 2018.  Market participants perceive anti-EU momentum in Italy to be particularly concerning and a substantiveMay 2–3, 20176 of 207contributor to the widening in Italian spreads to Germany, the light blue line, seen over the p ast year. Uncertainty regarding the French presidential election also affected  U.S. asset prices.  As shown in the bottom-right panel, the VIX inc reased as the French election came into the option expiry window.  With the market -friendly outcome of the election, the VIX dropped back near its all- time low .  The current level is within the first percentile of historical readings , in sharp contrast to the elevated measures of policy uncertainty. Alongside the very low levels of market- implied volatility, emerging market asset prices appreciated over the intermeeting period, as shown in the top- left panel of your next exhibit.  The attractiveness of carr y trades amid low volatility and reach -for-yield behavior remain common refrains from investors .  They continue to highlight accommodative monetary policies from advanced- economy central banks as a key driver of reach -for-yield behavior, with the ECB and Bank of Japan having been perceived as holding back from signaling a step toward reduced asset purchases. Subsiding concerns about China’s near- term economic growth trajectory also reportedly served to support emerging market assets over the period.  First -quarter Chinese GDP growth “printed” above consensus at 6.9 percent.  Tightened controls on resident outflows, in conjunction with renminbi stabilization, appear to have prompted a net capital inflow  in February, as shown by the blue bars in the top-right panel. Contacts expect this near -term stability in China to persist ahead of the Party Congress in the fall, but they are expecting Chinese authorities to take action to slow credit growth in the medium term. Recent efforts at gradually tighten ing liquidity spurred some financial market dislocations and small- scale defaults, underscoring the challenges ahead. With respect to expectations regarding FOMC  policy, market pricing and the Desk’s surveys indicate that a near -zero probability is attached to a rate hike at this meeting.  As shown by the red line in the middle- left panel, market pricing currently implies a roughly 65 percent probability of a 25 basis point rate hike  in June, comparable to what we saw the same time ahead of the December 2016 hike. Further out, the market -implied path of the policy rate declined, as shown by the shift from the gray line to the dark blue line in the middle- right panel. Market pricing implies roughly 30 basis points of further tightening in both 2017 and 2018.  Compared with just before the March FOMC, this is roughly one fewer 25 basis point hike priced in through year-end 2018.  Unconditional expectations regarding  the path of the target rate from the Desk’s surveys, the red diamonds, remain very close to the market-implied path, the dark blue line. Since the November FOMC, the survey- implied unconditional path of the target rate is still higher, primarily driven by an upward shift in expectations of the ra te"

Good afternoon, everyone.  As usual, this meeting will be a joint meeting of the FOMC and the Board of Governors.  I need a motion to close the meeting. MR. FISCHER.  So moved. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  And I would like to note that President Raph ael Bostic joined the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta last week as its new  president, and this is his first FOMC meeting .  Raphael, welcome. MR. BOSTIC.   Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  We look forward to working with you not only on monetary policy but on other S ystem matters as well. I’d also like to acknowledge the upcoming departure of Bill English.  At the January 2015 FOMC meeting , as he was stepping down from the positions of s ecretary of the FOMC  and director of the Division of Monetary Affairs, I expressed our appreciation for his extraordinary service during a very difficult time. Since then he’s made notable contributions on a range of projects as a senior s pecial advisor.  For the past year, Bill has been on leave visiting Yale University , his alma mater .  And it’s my understanding that, starting in August, Bill will return to Yale on a permanent basis. Stan Fischer is working on finding a way to keep Bill involved in the Fed History Vision P roject.  S o there is a chance that we will still get to see him in the halls from time to time .  Bill, let me thank you again for your extraordinary service. Okay.  Let’s move on to our formal agenda, and our first agenda item is the selection of a Committee officer.  At the Committee’s organizational meeting in January, I noted that PresidentJune 13–14, 20175 of 194Kashkar i intended to nominate an associate economist when the new r esearch director joined the Minneapolis Fed .  I understand that the new director has started and, indeed, is here today, and that President Kashkari is now prepared to make the nomination.  So let me ask President Kashkari to do that. MR. KASHKARI.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I’d like to nominate Mark L.J. Wright as associate economist.  He’s now the senior v ice p resident and director of r esearch at the Minneapolis Fed.  He joined us from the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago and previously was a tenured professor at UCLA. CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay.  Thank you.  Consistent with the Committee’s practice, the motion is to select Mr. Wright to serve as associate e conomist until the Committee’s first regularly sc heduled meeting in 2018.  Is there a second? MR. EVANS.  I would like to second the nomination of Mark Wright.  Mark’s departure from the research department in Chicago is a big loss, but I’m sure it will be outweighed by the gain to the System in Minneapolis. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Is there any further discussion?  [No response]  Then without objection, the selection is approved unanimously by the Committee.   Congratulations, Mark, and we look forward to working with you in your new role.  And now let’s move on to “Financial Developments and Open M arket Operations,” and I’ll call on Simon to begin the Desk briefing. MR. POTTER.1  Thank you, Madam Chair. Over the intermeeting period, solidifying expectations for a rate hike at this meeting, ongoing focus on risks in China, and diminishing prospects for U.S. fiscal stimulus left little apparent imprint on asset prices, and broad financial conditions continued to ease. One illustration of this easing is the decline in the Goldman Sachs Financial Conditions Index shown by the red line in the top- left panel of your first exhibit.  This and other similar indexes that try to measure broad financial cond itions all indicate a substantial easing in 1 The materials used by Mr. Potter and Ms. Logan are appended to this transcript (appendix 1).June 13–14, 20176 of 194conditions since liftoff in 2015.  Earlier in the hiking cycle, tighter financial conditions were associated with increases in the amount of policy tightening anticipated by markets over the year ahead, the blue line.  However, since the U.S. election, that correlation has broken down, and financial conditions have eased despite expectations of a somewhat steeper policy rate path. The top-right panel shows the contribution of the changes in the underlying asset prices to the change in the Goldman index from liftoff and the last rate hike in March. Since the March FOMC meeting , declines in longer-dated Treasury yields and the dollar, partly related to waning expectations for fiscal stimulus, have driven the easing in conditions.  Over the longer period since liftoff, the easing has been driven primarily by a rise in risk asset prices and valuations.   Indeed, the S&P 500 index hit a new nominal high over the intermeeting period. While recent corporate earnings have been strong, valuation metrics have also been elevated, with the Shiller CAPE measure of price to  earnings reaching a post-crisis high.  The declines in longer-dated Treasu ry yields over recent months have further supported equity prices. Easier financial conditions and buoyant equity and credit valuations have been accompanied by historically low levels of realized and market- implied volatility, which encourage investors to reach for riskier and higher -yielding assets and may be a sign of complacency.  As shown in the middle- left panel, measures of implied volatility across assets are about one standard deviation below their average levels since 1994.  Aside from there being  few known event risks over the near term, market participants cite long -term factors pinning down implied volatility that are similar to those underpinning easy financial conditions—namely, improving economic outlooks across advanced and emerging market economies, alongside expectations that some major central banks will contin ue their accommodative stances. Investors appear confident that Chinese authorities will manage the economy and financial system to achieve short -term stability ahead of the Party Co ngress in the fall.  However, excessive leverage in the Chinese economy continues to be top of mind for market participants as a medium- term risk. With aggregate credit at roughly 240 percent of GDP, contacts anticipate that Chinese authorities will conti nue gradually tightening liquidity in order to slow credit growth over the medium term. Relatedly, Moody’s cited the “continuing rise” in leverage in the Chinese economy as potential growth slows as the impetus for downgrading the country’s sovereign ratin g last month. The downgrade had few immediate consequences for global markets, as foreign investment in onshore bonds is limited.  Contacts did speculate, however, that partly in response to the downgrade, Chinese officials took precautionary measures to support the RMB, which abruptly appreciated about 1.5 percent against the dollar , as shown by the red line in the middle-right panel.  While prior efforts to influence the currency sparked global financial market volatility, these recent developments had l imited spillover effects , perhaps because they involved an appreciation, rather than a depreciation, of the RMB ."
194,20170726,"Following tradition, I might also note that, over his career , Scott has attended exactly 100 regularly scheduled FOMC meetings, counting today’s meeting.  It would be impossible to even begin to enumerate the areas in which Scott has made m ajor contributions to the Federal Reserve.  He has truly been integral to virtually all areas of our responsibilities, but we cannot let this moment pass without acknowledging the particularly crucial role Scott played in the dark days of the financial cri sis and its long, difficult aftermath.  I’ve noted previously that Scott has advised successive Chairs, including myself, with deep expertise and utmost integrity.  Speaking for myself, I’m enormously grateful for his wise counsel, calm, and good humor during times of stress, and, above all, his intense dedication to the public interest served by the Federal Reserve.   Scott, we deeply appreciate all that you have done for the System and the nation, and we wish you all the best in your ret irement.   [Applause] Regarding our formal agenda, our first item of business is to fill the upcoming vacancy in the position of the Committee’s general counsel.  As I think you know, the Board has appointed Mark Van  Der Weide as its general c ounsel effecti ve later this summer, and I would like to nominate him to also serve as the Committee’s g eneral counsel.  I might note that Mark is seated there at  the anteroom door.  Mark earned his law degree from Yale Law School in 1995.  He worked in the Board’s Legal Division from 1998 to 2009.  In 2009 and 2010, he was detailed to the Treasury Department, where he contributed to the development of financial reform legislation.   Since 2010, Mark has worked in the Division of Supervision and Regulation, including most recently as deputy d irector.   Mark’s selection as the FOMC’s general counsel would be effective at the time he becomes the Board’s general counsel.  Scott Alvarez will remain general counsel until then.  Consistent with the Committee’s usual practice, the nomination is for Mark to serve as the July 25–26, 20174 of 152Committee’s general counsel until the Committee’s first regularly scheduled meeting in 2018.  Do I have a motion on this nomination? VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  S o moved.  MR. FISCHER .  Second. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  And  without objection.  Mark, congratulations on your selection , and best wishes with your new responsibilities.  Now I’m going to turn to Simon for our Desk briefing. MR. POTTER.1  Thank you, Madam Chair.  The intermeeting period was relatively uneventful, with most market attention on the possibility that the ECB, in response to  the improving outlook in the euro area, is inching closer to reducing the pace of its asset purchases.  In June, President Draghi stated that the threat of deflation in the euro area has dissipated and that the ECB could “look through” recent low-inflation data, which caused German and U.S. rates to rise, as shown in the first column of the top -left panel of the first exhibit.  That said, the moves weren’t large and did not have any notable spillover to other asset classes, especially in comparison with the so -called bund tantrum  in 2015.  Domestic risk asset prices remain supported by an improving global economic outlook and strong corporate earnings. Meanwhile, the dollar depreciated against most G -10 currencies as several other developed market central banks either hiked rates or signaled they may be closer to doing so.  One exception was the Japanese yen, which depreciated against the dollar.  The Bank of Japan has remained committed to its current yield -curve -control framework.  The top-right panel shows the coincident moves in German and U.S. 10- year nominal yields following Draghi’s comments.  The 10 -year Treasury yield, the solid blue line, is now in the middle of the range seen since the U.S. election and slightly above its 5-year average, the dashed blue line.  Meanwhile, the 10-year German bund yield, the solid red line, remains below its 5 -year average.   The recent increase in bund yields has thus far been smaller than the increase observed during the bund tantrum in 2015, when bund yields rose more than  80 basis points.  Recall that the bund tantrum was sparked by better-than- expected euro -area data and less -accommodative ECB communications and was exacerbated by the unwinding of investor positioning that would have profited from lower yields. The middle- left panel shows that the level of three -month implied volatility on long-dated euro-area rates, the solid red line, was largely unresponsive to the rise in rates, especially w hen compared with  the dramatic increase seen during the bund  1 The materials used by Mr. Potter are appended to this transcript (appendix 1).  July 25–26, 20175 of 152tantrum.  Implied volatility has generally been trend ing lower for long -dated rates in Europe as well as the United States,  and both remain well below their five -year averages, the dashed lines.  For U.S. rates, the level of implied volatility is currently half the level seen at the peak of the 2013 taper tantrum. Overall, the ongoing low level of interest rate volatility suggests there was, at most, only a marginal shift in investors’ expectations for developed- market central bank policy over the intermeeting period.  Market participants still expect another reduction in the pace of ECB asset purchases to be announced later this year and to be implemented in early  2018.  Most contacts expect asset purchases to conclude fully by the end of next year at the latest. Despite the synchronized move higher in global yields following Draghi’s comments, respondents to the Desk’s most recent surveys did not rate changes in t he outlook for foreign monetary policy as a particularly important factor in explaining changes to their probabilistic forecasts for the 10 -year nominal Treasury yield since December 2016.  As shown in the middle-right panel, changes to the U.S. inflation outlook was the highest- rated factor on average; this factor was also highlighted in the Desk’s structured outreach  to market participants on the cu rrent level of Treasury yields. Market measures of inflation compensation and Desk -survey measures of inflation expectations have both declined since December, likely reflecting increas ed belief that inflation will continue to come in below the F OMC’s 2 percent objective.  As shown  in the bottom-left panel, respondents to the Desk surveys now, on average, assign  a roughly 60 percent probability to 12-month PCE inflation over the period 2 to 3 years ahead coming in at or below 2 percent.  In December, the odds placed on this outcome were a bit below 50 percent.  An increase in the perceived likelihood of lower inf lation outcomes is also seen in the Desk survey’s  average PDFs for CPI inflation over the next decade. Subdued inflation expectations were also reflected in a separate survey question that asked respondents to decompose the current level of the nominal 10- year Treasury yield.  The bottom-right panel shows that the median response for average inflation embedded in the 10- year nominal yield was around 1.8 percent, identical to the 10- year TIPS- implied breakeven rate at the time of the survey.  The median response for the 10- year average of the real rate was 0.5 percent.  For the market- implied term premium, it was roughly zero, higher than the staff model estimates, the blue and gr ay diamonds.  As you know, the staff has been focused on explaining t he decline in term premiums  both in the longer run and over the recent period.  Steve and Thomas will provide additional analysis of this, using the staff memo analyzing factors that have been driving the 10- year Treasury yield since December 2015.  In addition, it is useful to recall that one of the secular factors driving term premiums  lower is the perceived increased attractiveness of safe long -term fixed income as hedging instruments in an era of contained inflation and central banks using large -scale asset purchases at the effective lower bound.

195,20170920,"Transcript of the Federal Open Market Committee Meeting on  September 19 –20, 2017  September 19 Session   CHAIR YELLEN.  Let’s get started.  Good afternoon, everyone.  First, I need a motion to close the Board meeting.  This will be, again, a joint meet ing of the Board and the FOMC. MR. FISCHER.  So moved. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Without objection.  As you all know, Vice Chair man Fischer has announced that he will leave the Board next month, which means that this week’s meeting is his last as a member of this Committee.  He’ll be back at some point for a proper sendoff, and I’ll have more to say then.  But I can’t let this occasio n pass without trying to sum up what Stan’s service has meant to me, to the Committee, and to the important job we do here on behalf of the American people. I count myself very lucky that soon after I became Chairman , Stan agreed to serve as Vice Chairman , and it was also a fortunate development for the FOMC.  Few people have ever been as comprehensively qualified to serve as Vice Chair man, and few could have brought the credibility to this Committee and its deliberations that Stan did just by walking in th e door. As a scholar, Stan is revered as a tower ing figure in the development of macroeconomics and monetary policy.  As an international policymaker, he ’s a proven leader, adept at institution building and crisis management.  And as a central banker, even before his service on the FOMC, Stan had already helped Israel navigate through an era of difficult economic challenges, shielding it from the effects of the financial crisis.   Stan has, of course, taught and, in effect, recruited a generation of leading central bankers.  But I think Don Kohn put it best when he said that all modern central bankers  are students of Stan Fischer.  September 19–20, 20174 of 178Stan’s knowledge and deep expertise greatly strengthened the work of this Committee.  Our decisions were better, I’m certain, because of Stan’s contributions, and I’m sure that every one of us has gained insight about the economy from Stan.  I’m personally very grateful for Stan’s wise counsel, his insightful participation in our deliberations, and his strong support for the consensus we seek at each meeting, which is so important to the FOMC’s effectiveness.  Outside of this room, Stan has been a tireless leader of the Board and the S ystem.  He is surely the most accomplished and respected diplomat to have served on the Board, and, in  a very substantive way , Stan was the Fed’s ambassador to the world, ably representing us in multilateral settings.  In another sense, Stan has been an ambassador for central banking, speaking with indisputable authority about its vital role in  promoting ec onomic and financial stability and using his authority to forcefully defend the need for central banks, such as the Fed, to make monetary policy independent of political influence.  Stan has forthrightly defended the Fed’s work, implementing financial refo rms passed by the Congress, and in other ways has been a highly effective spokesman for the Board and the S ystem.  In addition, he has shouldered less glamorous responsibilities for the Board and the Committee with dedication and, when it was needed, consid erable patience.  I ’m grateful, for example, for Stan’s leadership of the communications subcommittee , as I’m sure Stan is grateful he will never again have to mediate  [laughter] between the warring factions on fan charts and other potential enhancements t o the SEP.  One reason for Stan’s success on jobs great and sometimes trying has been the good humor and conviviality he brings to any occasion.  Economics has been called the dismal science, but Stan has shown that that doesn’t mean one has to be a dismal scientist.  Stan’s September 19–20, 20175 of 178positive outlook has enlivened our meetings and lightened the burden of our responsibilities.  For my part, I will dearly miss my weekly lunches with Stan , during which our discussions spanned the fullest possible range of topics.  He ha s been unfailingly gracious and thoughtful, and it is a great gift to count him not only as an exceptional colleague, but also as a friend.  As many of us have experienced, Stan is an uncommonly decent person: kind and caring with family , co-workers, and everyone he encounters.  I found that there are two types of people in the world:  those who admire Stan Fischer and those who haven’t yet had the pleasure of knowing him. On behalf of everyone here, Stan, thank you for your superlative se rvice to the FOMC, the Federal Reserve, and the American people.  [Applause]  MR. FISCHER.  Well, Madam Chair, all I can say is , “So moved.”  [Laughter]  CHAIR YELLEN.  We will miss your contributions in that way as well.   Now, one other note regarding trans itions —as you recall, at the July meeting the Committee elected Mark Van Der Weide to serve as its general counsel effective at the time that he became the Board’s general counsel.  Mark became the Board’s general counsel on August 20, and his election as FOMC general counsel became effective on that date.  Mark, welcome, and best wishes with your new responsibilities. Okay.  Now let’s turn to the agenda.  O ur first item of business is to finalize changes to the Committee’s R ules regarding Availability of Information, which deals with FOIA matters.  We received a memo from the staff on this subject early this month.

But before we do so, I’d like to note that the Board’s photographer will take photos of the meeting later to day, toward the end of the economic go-round.  For information security, it would be helpful if at that time you closed or placed something over any confidential documents.  I might also note that, after we adjourn tomorrow, the FOMC Secretariat will provide a brief introduction to a new version of SDS.  Your attendance is optional, but we will have a presentation.  Okay.  This meeting, as usual, will be a joint meeting of the FOMC and the Board.  I need a motion to close the meeting.  MR. POWELL.  So moved. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Without objection.  As you all know, Randy Quarles has joined the Federal Reserve as the Board’s Vice Chairman for Supervision  and as a member of the Federal Open Market Committee.  Randy brings deep experience in banking, finance, law, and government, including his service as under s ecretary  and a ssistant s ecretary  of the U.S. Treasury Department.   Randy, welcome to the FOMC.  We all look forward to working with you. MR. QUARLES.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  I also want to note that this will be the last FOMC meeting for our secretary, Brian Madigan, who, after completing one final assignment—namely , drafting the minutes of this meeting —plans later this year to retire for a second time.   [Laughter] This is the 166 th FOMC meeting that Brian has attended.  Brian began his long and distinguished career at the Board in 1979 and rose quickly through the ranks.  He joined the newly formed Monetary Affairs Division in 1987 as one of its charter members.  Brian was October 31–November 1, 20174 of 171promoted to division d irector and also was appointed s ecretary of the FOMC  in the summer of 2007, just as the first signs of the impending financial crisis began to appear.  Within weeks after assuming these responsibilities, Brian was literally working around the clock in  supporting the Board and the FOMC in addressing all of the major challenges we faced, including the development of the liquidity programs and asset purchase programs and all of the issues associated with the formulation, implementation, and communication of monetary policy intentions at the effective  lower bound.  It is no exaggeration to say that there are few, if any, other people in the country that could have managed this range of responsibilities so expertly during the wartime atmosphere of the financial crisis.  In 2010, with 30 years of service—and , counting the crisis, about 130 years of service [laughter]— Brian decided to retire.  We were fortunate to lure him back to the Federal Reserve in 2015 for one more stint as s ecretary of the FOMC , a job that has required that Brian somehow devise language tha t all of us can agree fairly and accurately describes what has been discussed at each meeting.  As usual, Brian has performed flawlessly in that capacity.  Brian, throughout your career, you have exemplified the highest ideals of selfless service, leadershi p, dedication, and intelligence that this nation can hope for in a public servant.  I know I speak for everyone on the Board and the FOMC in saying that we have the deepest respect and gratitude for your service, especially during the darkest period of the financial crisis.  We wish you the very best in the future and hope that you ’ll now have a lot more time to spend with your family and especially your two new grandchildren. MR. MADIGAN.  Thank you very much.  [Applause]  October 31–November 1, 20175 of 171CHAIR YELLEN.  Now, turning to our formal agenda, we will soon have an opening in the position of FOMC s ecretary , and I would like to nominate James Clouse to serve in that capacity.  As I think you all know, Jim, who currently is FOMC a ssociate economist and deputy director in the D ivision of Monetary Affairs, is a highly talented and experienced economist and a widely respected Federal Reserve leader.   After receiving his Ph.D. from Northwestern University and serving a four- year stint as an a rmy officer, Jim joined Monetary Affairs  in 1989, and he has since risen steadily through the ranks.  He also was deputy a ssistant s ecretary  at the Treasury Department for one year, where he oversaw Treasury debt financing.  Over the past three decades, Jim has developed deep expertise in central banking broadly, the Federal Reserve in particular, and most especially in monetary policy implementation.   I might note that Jim is also an excellent writer, a skill that is critical for the FOMC s ecretary . Jim’s selection as s ecretary  would be effectiv e on November 26, a few days after the minutes of this meeting are published.  Jim would vacate his position as FOMC a ssociate economist at that time.  I anticipate that an officer from the Division of Monetary Affairs will be nominated to fill that a ssoci ate economist position at our organizational meeting in January.  Consistent with our most recent practice for the position of s ecretary , we would announce Jim’s selection this week rather than wait until the minutes are released.   Do I have a motion on Ji m’s selection?  VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  So moved. CHAIR YELLEN.  Second?  MR. POWELL.  Second. October 31–November 1, 20176 of 171"
197,20171213,"Transcript of the Federal Open Market Committee Meeting on  December 12 –13, 2017  December 12 Session   CHAIR YELLEN.  Good afternoon, everyone.  As usual, this meeting will be a joint meeting of the FOMC and the Board of Governors.  I need a motion to close the Board meeting. MR. QUARLES .  So moved. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Without objection.  And, as you know, the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond has announced the appointment of Tom Barkin as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond beginning January 1.  We look forward to our new colleague joining the Committee at the January meeting.  Mark Mullinix will be representing the Richmond Bank again today.  And, Mark, I want to thank you for so ably representing Richmond during these past five meetings.  We are very grateful for your contributions.  MR. MULLINIX.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  As y ou recall, we elected Jim Clouse as FOMC secretary , effective November 26, and this is his first meeting serving in that capacity.  So welcome, Jim.   And, finally, I would like to remind you that this evening we will have a chance to honor former Board Vic e Chairman Stanley Fischer at a reception downstairs.  All FOMC participants and all staff attending this meeting are invited to attend the reception.  Due to scheduling constraints, the reception needs to begin in a timely way, so we plan to adjourn for the day no later than 5:00 p.m. Okay.  W ith that, let’s turn to the formal agenda, and let me call on Simon to begin with the Desk presentation. MR. POTTER.1  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Over the intermeeting period, expectations that there would be a rate in crease at this meeting further solidified, with  1 The materials used by Mr. Potter and Ms. Logan are appended to this transcript (appendix 1).  December 12–13, 20174 of 173the market currently pricing in a very high probability of a 25 basis point move.  The market price -implied expectation was echoed in the Desk policy surveys, with all respondents anticipating an increase at this meeting.  As can be seen in the top -left panel of your first exhibit, both the current market-implied path, the dark blue line, and survey respondents’ probability-weighted expectations of  the target rate over the near term, the dark blue diamonds, shifted modestly higher, as ongoing strength in economic data served to reinforce expectations of  a gradual withdrawal of accommodation.  FOMC communications were perceived as generally consistent with those over the previous period and were not cited as dri ving significant price action.  In our surveys, the median responses indicate that no change in the SEP median funds rate path is expected , but many respondents did point to some upside risk to the se expectations in the case of  the overall dot plot. In terms of developments  next year, markets are, as shown in the top-right panel, currently pricing in about 15 basis points of additional tightening by the March meeting and nearly 50 basis points of tightening by 2018’s year -end.  Market commentary does not appear to reflect expectations of any material change in the FOMC’s reaction function as a result of the proposed future changes to the Committee’s composition.  Over the period, developments concerning fiscal policy were a major point of market focus, as the House and Senate have moved tax plans through their respective chambers.  Passage of a reconciled measure is viewed as likely by year -end.  Market participants widely discussed the potential economic and market effects of a tax bill, and while most view it as providing further support to equity prices, many also appear to expect it to have a relatively small effect  on the economic growth outlook. Respondents to the Desk’s surveys noted that the higher probability of passage was a prominent factor behind the increase in their forecasts for the federal fiscal deficit.  As shown in the middle- left panel, the median forecast of the deficit’s share of GDP rose to 4 percent for fiscal year 2019 and 4.3 percent for fiscal -year 2020, a 30 basis point and 48 basi s point increase over  the previous surveys, respectively.  That said,  forecasts for 2019 were generally around the levels earlier this year and the dispersion of views remains high, especially for 2020.  Expectations of an increase in the deficit, combined with the view that future Treasury debt issuance will be concentrated at shorter -tenor points on the curve—partly as a result of the November 1 recommendation by the TBAC—were widely cited as contributing to the 20 basi s point increase in two -year Treasury yields and the  related flattening of the Treasury yield curve over the period. This narrowing in the spread between long- and short -maturity Treasury yields —part of an ongoing curve-flattening trend observed over recen t years— receiv ed significant market attention over the intermeeting period.  As part of the staff analysis of this trend, respondents to the Desk’ s surveys were asked to decompose the 100 basis point narrowing in the spread between the 2-year and 30- year yields since the current hiking cycle began in December 2015.  T he middle -right panel shows that , on average, respondents attributed 69 basis points of the narrowing to an increase in December 12–13, 20175 of 173market expectations regarding the 2 -year average effective federal  funds rate and 26 basis points to a decline in the 30- year nominal term premium.  We also asked about the importance of various economic and market factors in explaining the spread narrowing.  H owever, respondents attached similar, moderate weights to factors su ch as changes in the economic outlook, changes to Treasury debt supply and issuance patterns, and spillovers coming from foreign monetary policy.  In his briefing, Thomas will further discuss the narrowing of the spread and its  possible implications.  Beyond the rise in shorter -dated interest rates, broader financial conditions are substantially easier than at the beginning of this hiking cycle, as shown in the first column of the bottom-left panel.  Over the intermeeting period, financial conditions were re latively little changed, except for an increase in equity prices that market participants largely attributed to the earnings implications of the tax legislation.  Consistent with this interpretation, the share prices of high -tax firms notably outperformed.  The broad U.S. dollar index depreciated roughly ½ percent.  Although the dollar move was modest on net, it received  a fair amount of attention , as it occurred ag ainst the backdrop of rising short- term U.S. interest rates and increasing likelihood of the tax bill’s passage.  Earlier in the period, markets quickly shrugged off a brief episode of volatility, which saw declines of several percent in global equit y prices and widening spreads on U.S. high-yield and emerging market debt.  Contacts cited a number of factors contributing to the cross- asset volatility —among them , heightened uncertainty over tax reform in the United S tates and below-expectations Chinese econom ic data  outcomes ; however, declines in these markets have mostly been retraced.  One interpretation of this resilience has been market participants’ underlying confidence in improving global fundamentals amid continued accommodative monetary policy across major central banks.  A more cautious interpretation might be that this episode reflects, and reinforces, a prevailing “buy the dip” mentality , regardless of possible underlying risks.  The exceptional volatility and rapid price appreciation of bitcoin —on which futures contracts were launched this past weekend —provides a vivid example of exuberance and risk -seeking behavior. Finally, one potential source of ongoing risk that market participants remain focused on is how Chinese policymakers rein in the excessive accumulation of debt that has occurred in the post- crisis period.  Efforts to reduce financial- sector leverage have resumed following the 19th  National Party Congress in October, as officials have further underscored their commitment to addressing fin ancial -sector risks, particularly in the shadow banking sector.  Market contacts have pointed to increases in market interest rates and increased volatility in equity markets as related to these efforts.  As indicated  in your bottom -right panel, Chinese government bond yields, shown in red, have risen to around 4 percent.  An important source of stability in the Chinese financial system has been the exchange value of the RMB, which has been little changed amid a benign dollar backdrop and more balanced capi tal flows.  However, for the period ahead, uncertainty remains over how policymakers will achieve a sustained slowdown in the growth of credit to nonfinancial borrowers amid December 12–13, 20176 of 173"
